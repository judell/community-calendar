 ’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And they are a 
 reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues of our time.
 ”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep passion for na
 ture and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured artist debut

 y artist\, Gen Zorich\, presents In the Clouds\, a collection of oil paint
 ings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift across our land
 scapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting their deeper
  environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geologist and envi
 ronmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understanding of the 
 natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as the rhythmic c
 loud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.  Billowing 
 pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds.”  Commen
 ting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clouds – they
 ’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And they are a 
 reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues of our time.

 ur Montmartre.”  Nature’s colorful offerings are displayed in Wilson
 ’s “Poppy Pods\,” Miller’s “Amaranth” and Sumner’s “Sonoma
  Vineyard.”  Reid lights up the hearth with her dynamic painting\, “C
 andles.”  LaLand cheers the season with roses and rosé in “Thanksgiv
 ing.”   Finally\, one could become a holiday star in one of Tobin-Char

 ings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift across our land
 scapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting their deeper
  environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geologist and envi
 ronmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understanding of the 
 natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as the rhythmic c
 loud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.  Billowing 
 pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds.”  Commen
 ting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clouds – they
 ’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And they are a 
 reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues of our time.
 ”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep passion for na
 ture and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured artist debut

 \, restorative yoga\, and live contemplative music nourish emotional and c

 ation as catalysts for transformation. Art forms like poetry\, music\, dan
 ce\, and other creative expressions help soften stress patterns\, expand p
 erception\, and open us to new ways of thinking and being.\n\nEmotional aw

 d by community and the earth itself.  Guest teacher Eve Ekman will lead a
 n exercise in promoting emotional awareness and equanimity.\n\nTogether\,

DESCRIPTION:with Elissa Epel\, Nichol Joy Chase and Eve Ekman\n\nDeep rest
  is a powerful pathway to healing\, recalibrating our nervous system towar
 d ease\, clarity\, and equanimity. In this program\, we explore the scienc
 e and art of restoration—how meditation\, breathwork\, sensory immersion
 \, restorative yoga\, and live contemplative music nourish emotional and c
 ellular renewal.\n\nWe also lean into the power of creativity\, and imagin
 ation as catalysts for transformation. Art forms like poetry\, music\, dan
 ce\, and other creative expressions help soften stress patterns\, expand p
 erception\, and open us to new ways of thinking and being.\n\nEmotional aw
 areness becomes a bridge—from self to systems\, from tension toward whol
 eness—as we rest in a supportive environment and beautiful setting\, hel
 d by community and the earth itself.  Guest teacher Eve Ekman will lead a
 n exercise in promoting emotional awareness and equanimity.\n\nTogether\, 
 we reconnect with deep rest as a generative force\, opening us to mystery\
