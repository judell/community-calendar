 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w
 ill determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works
  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\
 + monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio r
 ecording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Plat
 form\n\nQ&As: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.\n\nSour

  Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Day
 lighting the Creek as "a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the g
 lory days of early bluegrass guitar." Chilliwack\, BC-based Trisha Gagnon 
 is portrayed by Sing Out! as "one of the most versatile" and "irresistible
 " lead vocalists in bluegrass\, her strong and distinctive style ranging f
 rom "mournful and plaintive" to "hopeful and yearning." Trisha anchors wha
 t Dirty Linen magazine calls "gorgeous three-part harmonies." She's also k
 nown for songwriting\, dating back to her early days with the award-winnin
 g B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gil
 l and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo\, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his ow
 n voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contempo
 rary banjo players. "Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingli
 ng\," said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\)\, was nom
 inated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015\, and Nick is a composer wh
 o also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley S
 tation on the new Jaybird album "showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense 
 of melody\," said Green Man Review. Spokane\, WA-based Greg Spatz is haile
 d as a "world-class bluegrass fiddler" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Aud
 ition says Greg's "virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after ti
 me\," while Bluegrass Unlimited says he "lays down some seriously fine blu
 egrass fiddle" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made 
 him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast\, where he'
 s played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield\, resophonic guitar maste
 r Rob Ickes\, and many others including Laurie Lewis\, Bryan Bowers\, and 
 Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squ
 irrel\, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with h
 is wife called All Along the Sea\, and is an award-winning\n\nSource: Pres

 and catching the eye of A-listers including Katy Perry\, whose 2023 NYE pa

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp

 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb
 aud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid\, an OLLI instructor for Son
 oma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture\, we will be discuss

 nly delicious dessert paintings\, but also landscapes and figures. In this
  discussion\, we will look at his famous works\, review his life\, and lea

 SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry D

 Loving\\) to Read on TikTok! Oliver will be joined in conversation by belo

 provoking\, Unread is an inspiring\, hopeful memoir of growth and change -
  Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational n
 eglect\, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approxi
 mately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However\, at age 32\,
  with big dreams and few tools to actualize them\, he dedicated himself to
  learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliv
 er has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documen
 ted his decision to learn to read as an adult\, and his struggles and triu
 mphs along the way. Here\, he tells the full story behind his journey for 
 the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his exper
 ience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us ho
 w to be better\, more empathetic people. In just 365 days\, Oliver went fr
 om barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal o
 f finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us 
 that words and stories have power\, and that\, no matter our past\, it's n
 ever too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal
  trainer\, motivational speaker\, literacy activist\, and influencer. He h
 as been featured in or on Today\, NPR\, Jennifer Hudson Show\, Los Angeles
  Times\, Newsweek\, Rachael Ray\, and ABC News\, among many others. Additi
 onally\, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Lite
 racy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa\, California. Mychal Threets is a libra
 rian\, literary ambassador\, and the library's number one fan \\(according
  to himself\, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-
 school kid and grew up in Fairfield\, CA\, right between Sacramento and Sa
 n Francisco. Online\, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people th
 at their mental health always matters\, and he encourages everyone to know
  they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself\, Mychal is proud to
  serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/
 26\\) is his first book. His cats\, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barl
 ow\, did not help at all\, but he still appreciates them. Read On Sonoma a
  dedicated group of professionals\, educators and volunteers promoting lit
 eracy within our elementary schools. Donate directly\, meet the Executive 
 team\, and learn more about the tremendous work that they do by joining us
  that evening. For more information\, please visit their  website . Praise
 : "Unread feels like both story and concordance\, a good read and a great 
 resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But 
 mostly\, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in o
 rder to enunciate resilience\, one must learn the phonetics of desire\, su
 rvival\, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel." -Jason Reynolds\, New Yor
 k Times bestselling author of the Track series "An inspiring and deeply hu
 man story about resilience\, courage\, and the transformative power of lit
 eracy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey\, shared with millions onl
 ine\, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He
  not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late
  to learn\, to dream\, and to rewrite your own story." -Andrew Roberts\, P
 resident\, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy "Oliver James is a 
 big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave
 \, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . 
 He's the living\, breathing\, thriving example of what reading can do for 
 a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel\, there a
 re quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he 
 went through-but if their parents\, educators\, and leaders would read thi
 s memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them\, to
 o. This raw\, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has be
 en through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth
 ." -I. C. Robledo\, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By "Unread isn'
 t just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of ou
 r own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to 
 the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver J
 ames is a role model for us all." -Kelley Coleman\, author of Everything N
 o One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child "A thoughtful and inspiri
 ng story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading help
 s to change lives." -Kirkus\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Join the Laguna de Santa Rosa Foundation in welcoming artist a
 nd marine conservation advocate Firuze Gokce for an inspiring talk that bl
 ends art\, science\, and storytelling. In this presentation\, Firuze share
 s her creative process of transforming whale songs\, spectrograms\, and re
 al marine research into vibrant visual art. Through the true stories of in
 dividual whales and the scientific discoveries behind her pieces\, she exp
 lores how storytelling can spark emotional connection and drive conservati
 on action. This talk invites audiences to listen more deeply to the ocean\
 , understand the lives of the whales who inhabit it\, and discover the pow
 er of art as a voice for the natural world.\n\nFiruze Gokce reached a sign

 n featured her prints and immersive videos that blended visual art with th
 e auditory experience of whale songs\, offering a multi-sensory exploratio
 n of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale
  sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally\, her piece "Brave Little
  Hunter" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island\, highlighting 
 her ability to convey the emotional depth of the natural world. Firuze was
  also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in Oc
 tober 2024\, further solidifying her place in the art community. Her artwo
 rk “Diving into the Depths of the Ocean” received an “Honorary Menti
 on Award” from the Marine Society of Artists.\n\nGuests are welcome to a

DESCRIPTION:February 26-28\, 2026\n\nSt Columba’s Writing and Spirituali
 ty Series presents Be Not Afraid: Finding Words that Equip us for the Mome
 nt. This spring in-person writing retreat led by Marilyn MacEntyre follows
  her successful online workshops and in-person retreats in 2023-25.\n\nWe 
 are delighted to invite you to her 2026 spring offering\, this retreat wil
 l run February 26-28 2026\, 4:00 pm Thursday through 3:00 pm Saturday.\n\n
 Escalating political conflict\, a polarized economy\, ongoing warfare\, an
 d climate anxieties give us plenty of occasion to come face to face with o
 ur fears. We may have to dig deeper for hope these days\, but we know wher
 e to find it. In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how "Be not afr
 aid" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation\, and ho
 w even in the midst of troubles\, both public and personal\, we can help e
 ach other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both o
 ur own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will 
 focus on experiences of fear\, courage\, consolation\, and resilience in t
 he historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nM
 arilyn McEntyre\, writer and longtime professor of literature\, coaches wr
 iters and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley\, Western Theologica
 l Seminary and the Oblate School of Theology. Her books include Caring for
  Words in a Culture of Lies\, When Poets Pray\, and Speaking Peace in a Cl
 imate of Conflict. A new book about writing\, Start With a Word\, is comin
 g out in February 2026 and can be pre-ordered at eerdmans.com. See more\, 
 and contact her\, at marilynmcentyre.com.\n\nCost: $295-$695 depending on 
 choices about lodging/commuting\n\nPartial scholarships available \n\nReg

 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 t poetry collections\, respectively\, Daphne Lifts Up and The Bastard & Th

 rson-Johnson. Local watercolor artist and college instructor\, Barbara Mar
 lin\, creator of the Daphne Lifts Up book cover will display the original 
 artwork and selected prints of other work at the event. Following the read
 ings and music\, a Q&A will follow\, with book sales and signing in the lo
 bby. Refreshments will be available for sale. This is free event\, all don
 ations always gratefully accepted.    Donna Emerson divides her time betwe

 e Press\, 2018\\) and Beside the Well \\(Cherry Grove Collections. 2019\\)
 . And now\, Daphne Lifts Up \\(Finishing Line Press\, 2025\\). Donna has r
 eceived two nominations for the Pushcart Prize\, one for "Best of the Net\
 ," two nominations for the California Book Award \\(Body Rhymes\, 2009\, T
 he Place of Our Meeting\, 2018\\)\, five awards from the annual Allen Gins
 berg Contests\, and numerous regional awards for her poetry\, creative non
 -fiction\, and prose. Many of her poems appear in journals or anthologies 
 with her black and white or color photography. Anais Nin used Donna's port
 raits of Anais in her late diaries and press coverage in the New York Time
 s.  Donna has taught poetry to elementary school children and made it part
  of her community college classrooms \\(1990-2015\\). She worked as a volu
 nteer with Alzheimer's patients at a residential facility to help them cre
 ate individual and group poems and served as Board member and Events Chair
  for the Marin Poetry Center \\(2012-2014\\). Donna's latest book\, "Daphn
 e Lifts Up" includes poems about nature around us\, nature within us\, and
  relationships with many different people\, from family to counseling clie
 nts\, to students\, colleagues at work\, animals\, birds\, and strangers. 
 It addresses birth\, illness\, death\, and resiliency in all these verses.
     Gerald Fleming is the author of the poetry collections The Bastard and
  the Bishop \\(Hanging Loose Press\, 2021\\)\, One \\(Hanging Loose\, 2016
 \\)\, The Choreographer \\(Sixteen Rivers Press\, 2013\\)\, Night of Pure 
 Breathing \\(Hanging Loose\, 2011\\)\, and Swimmer Climbing onto Shore \\(
 Sixteen Rivers\, 2005\\). His work has appeared in many magazines over the
  decades\, including New Letters\, Michigan Quarterly Review\, Hanging Loo
 se\, Carolina Quarterly\, New World Writing\, Volt\, Paris Lit Up\, and Ve
 rsal.  Fleming edited the print magazines Barnabe Mountain Review and Forw
 ard to Velma\, the vitreous magazine One \\(More\\) Glass\, and The Collec
 ted Poetry & Prose of Lawrence Fixel \\(Sixteen Rivers\, 2021\\). He has w
 ritten numerous books for teachers\, including Rain\, Steam\, and Speed \\
 (Jossey-Bass/Wiley\, 2005\\)\, and lives most of the year near San Francis
 co\, part of the year in Paris. Fleming\, a master of the prose poem\, is 
 never satisfied to sing the same song\, and this adventuresome spirit pays
  dividends in these new prose poems. Constantly surprising and inventive\,
   The Bastard and the Bishop offers stories within stories that effortless
 ly merge the personal and the archetypal\, breathing new life into a genre
  that has increasingly\, and often sadly\, become predictable.     Jared E

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh

 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

 ON: SATURDAY\, FEBRUARY 7\, 2026\, 3 – 5 pm: Join in to meet the artists
 \, celebrate the show and welcome the season of love. Take part in the Gal
 lery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  
 Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists\, Linda Barretta\, N
 ancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Shore\, Luba
  Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love\, paintings that bring o
 ut the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring 
 role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets\
 , blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart 
 is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicio
 us red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  fruit rendered so re
 alistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\, Schaffer and Zo
 rich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tu
 lips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered
  and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers 
 up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox pe
 ers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Show
 ering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stu
 nning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the
  fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious
  way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!\, a collection o
 f works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout
  the world\, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured\, suc
 h as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved pa
 rt of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold
  Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valen
 tine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.”
  Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMee

 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center Street\, Healdsburg\, C

 leness—a continuity passed down through the Buddhadharma and the unbroke

 role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets\
 , blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart 
 is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicio
 us red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  fruit rendered so re
 alistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\, Schaffer and Zo
 rich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tu
 lips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered

 up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox pe
 ers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Show

 n of the spiritual journey as a path of love\, where the heart’s discont
 ent becomes the doorway to ultimate fulfillment.\n\nAlthough the heart see
 ks fulfillment in people\, possessions\, and experiences\, no external lov

 —a sacred invitation to turn inward. True fulfillment arises only when w
 e empty our hearts to make space for the formless and intangible inner Bel

 rt. Discover how the search for love leads us through emptiness into a lum
 inous darkness—a place where the mind is confounded\, but the heart awak
 ens to a passionate love for the unknown and to its potential for resting 
 into the deepest fulfillment possible.\n\nThis half-day program is based o
 n the new book\, The Inner Beloved: The Heart’s Journey to Divine Unity
  \\(Shambhala\, 2026\\). Copies of the book will be available for purchase

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books welcomes friend and beloved lo
 cal author Eirinie Carson to Petaluma for the launch of her hypnotic new G
 othic thriller - Bloodfire\, Baby: A Novel! Join us for a chilling reading
  and discussion followed by an audience Q&A and book signing with photo op
 portunities. This is a free event\, registration required due to limited s
 eating. A maternal gothic tale of new motherhood and the torment of a cent
 uries-old haunting Before the shadow appeared\, Sofia thought mothering wo
 uld be all sun-drenched light and white linen sheets\, as seen advertised 
 by the momfluencers of Instagram. In her gorgeous home anchored in a posh 
 suburb\, far removed from her origins\, Sofia revels in her success. Mothe
 rhood seems like the natural next step\, but when her husband travels for 
 a work trip\, leaving Sofia all alone with their unnamed three-week-old ba
 by\, she can't quite square how mothering falls solely in her lap. Nobody 
 seems able or willing to help her: not her husband\, not her best friend\,
  and certainly not the zealot mother she cut off long ago. Her postpartum 
 reality is overtaken by an ominous figure. Sleep-deprivation collides with
  a darkness that creeps in and begins to spread\, threatening to consume h
 er entirely. As her grip on reality slips away\, Sofia learns of an insidi
 ous haunting that has plagued the eldest daughters in her family for gener
 ations. With her baby's safety on the line\, Sofia realizes she must confr
 ont her murky history or risk losing more than just the veneer of perfecti
 on. Author: Eirinie Carson is a member of the Writers Grotto in San Franci
 sco and a frequent contributor to Mother magazine. Her work has also appea
 red in LitHub\, Notre Dame Review\, Mortal Mag\, Electric Literature\, The
  Sonora Review\, and others. Bloodfire\, Baby is her first novel. Praise: 
 ‘Eirinie Carson's BLOODFIRE\, BABY arrives kicking and screaming with fl
 ames in its hair and lightning in its hands as it heralds a new powerful l
 iterary voice being born. Raw\, honest\, mysterious and ultimately courage
 ous\, BLOODIFRE\, BABY is the book that will peel away your misconceptions
  and lay bare the power and the beauty of the feminine mystique. Not to be
  missed.' -S.A. Cosby author of King of Ashes ‘BLOODFIRE\, BABY is a fer
 ocious\, hypnotic descent that burrows under your skin and refuses to let 
 go. Carson expertly plunges us into the sleepless\, paranoid depths of new
  motherhood where ancestral ghosts collide with the present-day terror of 
 a negotiable reality. A fever dream\, a psychological thriller\, and a whi
 p smart commentary on modern motherhood\, BLOODFIRE\, BABY is destined to 
 be a novel people press into each other's hands\, whispering 'you have to 
 read this.'-Chelsea Bieker\, author of Madwoman ‘The most nuanced examin
 ation of postpartum I have ever read\, BLOODFIRE\, BABY spans continents a
 nd generations in its kaleidoscopic portrayal of motherhood\, race\, and c
 lass. Rarely is a novel as propulsive as it is illuminating\, but this is 
 uncannily infused with a heavy\, knowing dread that intensifies with each 
 turn of the page. That expert pacing--along with the novel's exquisite lan
 guage\, depth\, and scope--announces Eirinie Carson as a refreshing and es
 sential new voice in contemporary fiction.' -Margaret Wilkerson Sexton\, a
 uthor of On The Rooftop ‘BLOODFIRE\, BABY is a novel of crackling honest
 y\, daring\, and vigor that only a mother could write. Carson's relentless
 \, page-turning plot weaves the frank\, uninhibited sensualities of mother
 hood and body horror into a thick\, powerful rope\, then ties you tightly 
 to the page right alongside our heroine. Carson's novel is a wild\, transf
 ormative ride written in neon from the first page to the last. Yes\, only 
 a mother could create this haunting\, mighty book\, but everyone must read
  it.' --Savala Nolan\, Don't Let it Get You Down: Essays on Race\, Gender\
 , and the Body\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists\, Linda Barretta\, N
 ancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Shore\, Luba
  Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love\, paintings that bring o
 ut the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring 
 role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets\
 , blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart 
 is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicio
 us red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  fruit rendered so re
 alistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\, Schaffer and Zo
 rich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tu
 lips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered
  and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers 
 up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox pe
 ers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Show
 ering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stu
 nning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the
  fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious
  way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!\, a collection o
 f works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout
  the world\, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured\, suc
 h as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved pa
 rt of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold
  Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valen
 tine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.”
  Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMee

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:Mama’s Broke is a powerful folk duo that deliver a compellin
 g performance with heart and raw energy. Although highly influenced by the
 ir Canadian roots\, Lisa and Amy are based out of nowhere and everywhere. 
 \n\nTheir two strong voices blend to create haunting harmonies\, while the
 y artfully juggle fiddle\, banjo\, guitar and mandolin\, and incorporate t
 raditional dance and foot percussion into their performance. Their origina
 l – and often dark – compositions push the boundaries of tradition and
  the constraints of genre. Drawing from old-time\, Quebecois\, blues\, pun
 k\, Celtic\, Balkan and  doom metal\, they create a soundscape that is bot
 h familiar and new. \n\nSince forming the band in 2014\, Mama’s Broke ha
 s been gaining momentum fast \; having already completed two European\, an
 d several Canadian and U.S. tours. They have performed in a wide range of 
 venues\, from circus shows in New Orleans\, to pirate ships in Amsterdam\,
  to concert halls in Ireland\, to theatres in Brooklyn. In this way\, they
  stay true to the transient nature of folklore\, as they travel the world 
 sharing and collecting song.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 work\, he seems excited to work with a “real writer\,” and together th

 :\n\nChef Carlos was born in El Salvador\, where his passion for cooking b
 egan in the kitchen with his grandmother and mother\, creating simple yet 
 flavorful family meals. After his family migrated to the United States\, C
 arlos worked at his uncle’s restaurant in Sebastopol\, further deepening
  his love for food. While attending Piner High School\, in Santa Rosa\, he
  joined a newly established culinary program\, where he learned profession
 al kitchen skills and participated in local food competitions with renowne
 d chefs like Guy Fieri and Rich Nolan. In 2008\, his high school team won 
 first place in the Santa Rosa Iron Chef competition. During this time\, Ca
 rlos also took on the responsibility of cooking family meals\, solidifying
  his dream of becoming a chef. \n\nAfter graduating\, Carlos started at J
 ackson’s in Santa Rosa as a dishwasher but quickly worked his way up thr
 ough various kitchen roles\, impressing his colleagues with his dedication
  and skill. His hard work caught the attention of two restaurateurs\, who 
 offered him a sous chef position at their new restaurant. While thriving i
 n this role\, Carlos realized his passion for showcasing Latin cuisine and
  decided to pursue further education. He earned an associate degree from S
 anta Rosa Junior College’s culinary program and took additional courses 
 at the Culinary Institute of America \\(CIA\\) Greystone\, St. Helena focu
 sing on pastry and butchery. Next up\, Chef Carlos was the head of food de
 velopment at La Tortilla Factory in Santa Rosa\, creating new recipes and 
 products. \n\nAt 24\, Carlos saved $60\,000 from playing in a popular\, a
 ward winning family band and flipping a house with his father. In 2014\, h
 e found a small restaurant space in Healdsburg and\, with his father as a 
 partner\, opened Guiso Latin Fusion on October 15\, 2015. Drawing inspirat
 ion from Central and South America\, Carlos built the restaurant’s reput
 ation organically\, eventually gaining recognition from a San Francisco Ch
 ronicle food writer\, which propelled his success.\n\nFor Carlos\, food is
  art\, and every dish tells a story rooted in his culture and childhood. H
 e strives to create a family-like atmosphere in his restaurant\, where gue
 sts feel connected and leave with memorable experiences. Beyond running hi
 s restaurant\, Carlos mentors young chefs\, develops a rosé wine brand ca
 lled BELI’S\, and continues to “Live a Flavorful Life.” His motto\, 
 “Cook My Culture\,” reflects his deep connection to his roots and his 
 passion for creating meaningful culinary experiences.\n\nAWARDS\n\n\\+Best

 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra

 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c

  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh

 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 We will learn the basics \\(if a beginner\\) and beyond\, through warm-ups
 \, discover the language of tap dance\, learn the Shim Sham\, and routines
  that will launch you onto your own exploration of the dance form. Tap is 
 an extremely fun and rewarding form of dance. Tap Dance originated in the 
 19th century through a fusion of African and Irish dance styles\, becoming
  a unique American art form in the melting pot of New York City. It develo
 ped through percussive footwork\, initially on plantations and in urban ce
 llars\, and later gained widespread popularity through minstrel shows\, va
 udeville\, and Hollywood musicals. Innovators like  Bill "Bojangles" Robin
 son \, the  Nicholas Brothers \, Eleanor Powell\, Fred Astaire\, Gene Kell
 y to name just a few\, who shaped its evolution\, which continues today wi
 th new fusions in contemporary dance. May 26\, Bojangle's birthday\, is Na
 tional Tap Dance Day. Starr Hergenrather has been teaching Theatre and Dan
 ce for over 54 years\, dancing for 70 years\, which is amazing since she i
 s only 45 years old! She received her Theatre Arts and Teaching Credential
 s in 1971 from Denver\, CO. Starr has taught theatre/creative dramatics/im
 provisation/dance to all ages and directed and produced theatre for many\,
  many years. She and her family moved to Sebastopol in 1983. In 1987\, she
  received her Dance credential and degree from SSU. Starr loves the theatr
 e and dance and everything about them. She has performed on stage and in f
 ilm throughout her teaching career. Before joining the staff at Analy in 2
 001 where she became the Theatre Arts Program Director and taught one danc
 e class starting in 2010\, when the high school lost its Dance instructor 
 due to No Child Left Behind\, she taught at Brookhaven School from 1990-20
 01 teaching a myriad of subjects\, including Theatre and Dance\, and Rinco
 n Valley Junior High School from 1987-1997\, as BJ Van Noy's choreographer
  and asst. director of her Music Program. Starr's tap mentor was a Vaudevi
 lle and later Broadway song and Dance man by the name of Jack Williams. St
 arr studied with Jack for almost 20 years.\, until his waning years. Tap\,
  which is a magical form of dance\, btw\, is Starr's first dance love\, ne
 xt to swing\, salsa\, and partner dancing\, and then just plain social\, w
 ild hippie dancing at concerts. Starr also teaches Private Tap Lessons for
  any level dancer. Starr has a studio at her home.\n\nSource: Press Democr

 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th

 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb
 aud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid\, an OLLI instructor for Son
 oma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture\, we will be discuss
 ing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not o
 nly delicious dessert paintings\, but also landscapes and figures. In this
  discussion\, we will look at his famous works\, review his life\, and lea
 rn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the 
 SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry D

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 Daniel specializes in historically informed performance. Called “the for
 emost performer in the world of the fortepiano” (Aspen Daily News)\, he 
 has been praised for imbuing “\\[Beethoven’s\\] tenderness\, longing\,
  and frustration into the very notes” (Orlando Sentinel)\, for “lavish
  but tasteful” playing (Classical Sonoma)\, and as “a privilege to hea
 r” (Marblehead Current). He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in Lon
 don and at the University for Music and Performing Arts in Vienna and perf
 orms exclusively on historic Viennese fortepianos.\n\nAppearing with him a
 t the Raven is Grammy-nominated soprano Jennifer Ellis Kampani\, who is kn
 own for her expressive interpretations of Lieder — Classical-era songs.
  Ellis Kampari has appeared at Carnegie Hall and performed with leading e
 nsembles including American Bach Soloists\, Apollo’s Fire\, Opera Lafaye
 tte\, and Portland Baroque Orchestra. She lives in Los Angeles and teaches
  at USC. Sunday\, February 15th. 7:00 PM. Front of House: $38 General Adm

DESCRIPTION:The ancient art form of Flamenco serves as a symbol of unity a
 mong diverse communities and is recognized internationally as an essential
  part of Spain's heritage. It embodies the spirit of the Spanish people\, 
 capturing a wide range of emotions such as joy\, sorrow\, and defiance\, m
 ore relevant than ever in today’s world. Flamenco's recognition by UNESC
 O as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010 further underscor
 es its cultural significance.\n\nAt its core\, flamenco is an intensely em
 otional art form. The performances\, characterized by passionate singing \
 \(cante\\)\, intricate guitar playing \\(toque\\)\, and expressive dance \
 \(baile\\)\, convey feelings that are often difficult to articulate. The c
 oncept of "duende\," refers to the soulful connection between performer an
 d audience\, representing authenticity and emotional depth. Flamenco allow
 s artists to express their personal experiences and connect with the audie
 nce on a visceral level\, making each performance unique.\n\n'polyglottist

DESCRIPTION:**Homeopathy: Practical Remedies for Healing** is an educatio
 nal and empowering talk that brings the gentle yet powerful principles of 
 homeopathy into everyday life.\n\n Drawing from the same global wisdom hi
 ghlighted in the film ***Introducing Homeopathy***—that healing can be 
 effective\, subtle\, and deeply respectful of the body’s innate intellig
 ence—this presentation explores the foundations of homeopathy\, its hist
 ory\, and how potencies work.\n\n**Annie Osborn will demystify this often-
 misunderstood modality and ground it in practical\, real-world application
 s that support the whole person: body\, mind\, and nervous system.**\n\nWi
 th over 25 years in natural medicine\, Annie shares clinical pearls rarely
  taught\, offering guidance on remedies for common ailments such as pain\,
  allergies\, digestion\, insomnia\, hormonal balance\, mood challenges\, a
 nd first aid\, along with powerful approaches to detoxification and deeper
  healing support for issues like nerve health and bone strength. Her insig
 hts echo the film’s message that homeopathy is not just a theory\, but a
  living\, time-tested system used worldwide—one that invites curiosity\,
  personal empowerment\, and a more conscious relationship with health and 
 healing.\n\n**Be sure to attend the viewing of Introducing Homeopathy wit
 h us in the EESystem on February 7th!**\n\n**ABOUT ANNIE OSBORN**\n\nAnnie
  Osborn is a natural medicine kinesiologist and licensed acupuncturist for
  25 years in Sonoma County.  She was the technical specialist for 12 year
 s at Boericke & Tafel Homeopathic Company\, where she trained health store
  staff in homeopathy. There she attended 35 homeopathic conferences.  Ann
 ie has a certificate in homeopathic principles and practice\, and has been
  using homeopathy in her practice for over 30 years.\n\nSource: Press Demo

DESCRIPTION:with Kaira Jewel Lingo\n\nHow do we meet moments of overwhelm 
 when it feels like there’s no space inside? In this half-day of mindfuln
 ess\, we’ll explore body-based practices that help us stay grounded with
  strong emotions rather than running from them or being swept away. Throug
 h mindful breathing\, walking\, and listening to the body’s wisdom\, we 
 return to the steadiness of the present moment.\n\nAs we learn to tend our
  emotions with care\, we also strengthen the inner resilience needed for t
 he larger transformation our world is calling for. These practices help lo
 osen patterns of fear and reactivity so we can participate in the great tu
 rning toward more life-giving ways of being together.\n\nDrawing on Buddhi
 st psychology\, together we’ll learn to recognize\, accept\, and gently 
 hold difficult emotions. From this compassionate presence\, emotions settl
 e\, insight emerges\, and new possibilities become available for both pers
 onal and collective healing.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh

 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 three to make it a full day experience at 20% off! This workshop focuses o
 n making boxes using vintage Japanese colored paper. Both the size and con
 struction method of the boxes are carefully designed to minimize paper was
 te. The core structure of each box is created using a contemporary bookbin
 ding technique known as the V-cut\, which allows the corners to be excepti
 onally sharp and beautifully finished. We hope you will discover a unique 
 charm in these boxes\, which combine old materials with new techniques–o
 ffering a character different from that of brand-new boxes. Each set consi
 sts of a box base and a matching lid. You may choose from three available 
 sizes\, as well as your preferred colored paper from approximately ten dif
 ferent varieties of vintage Japanese paper. During the workshop\, you will
  assemble pre-cut core components and use a traditional Japanese brush to 
 apply paste and carefully mount the colored paper onto the surface of the 
 box. This workshop is recommended for individuals with an interest in vint
 age objects\, traditional materials\, and Japanese tools. It is suitable f
 or participants aged 13 and over\, as the process involves delicate work w
 ith thin paper and requires careful handling.\n\nJapanese Guest Artist Boo

 love shaped by longing\, grief\, devotion\, and grace. Through guided writ

 ntemplative pauses\, participants will allow words to emerge as poetry and
  prayer: tender\, imperfect\, and true.\n\nDuring our time together\, you
 ’ll be invited to:\n\nExperience poetry writing as a contemplative\, pra
 yerful practice\n\nListen for the poetry of love unfolding in your life\n\
 nWrite in response to guided prompts rooted in sacred listening\n\nReflect

 Register for more than one workshop and receive a 10% discount. Sign up fo

 , participants will learn the structure of Masunaga’s original bookbindi
 ng technique “Waterwheel Binding” by creating a simple model. The sess
 ion offers a hands-on introduction to the technique and invites participan
 ts to explore its unique creative potential. The structure lends itself to
  many variations\, and it can serve as a source of new ideas for participa
 nts’ own artistic projects. Waterwheel Binding is a bookbinding techniqu
 e originally developed in 2011 for the work The Intersection. Instead of u
 sing glue\, single-sheet pages are woven into an accordion-folded cover wi
 th narrow paper strips. The technique can be adapted in many ways by chang
 ing the materials or the scale\, giving participants the freedom to develo
 p their own creative ideas. The workshop is intended for participants who 
 have an interest in making things – such as artists or those with some b
 ookbinding experience – rather than complete beginners.\n\nJapanese Gues

DESCRIPTION:Headlining!\n\nPhil Johnson delivers a high-energy comedy expe
 rience that seamlessly blends stand-up and music. With a sharp eye for the
  absurd and a linguist’s love of wordplay\, he tackles topics like tech\
 , body image\, race\, and American weirdness - all delivered from the view
 point of a guy who happily grew up in the deeply multi-everything communit
 y of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPhil’s material is smart\, satirical
 \, and unafraid to ask bigger questions while still chasing the laugh.\n\n
 He’s been featured at the Sundance Film Festival\, Edinburgh Fringe Fest
 ival\, on Sirius/XM\, Bob & Tom Radio\, and Amazon Prime. Phil has release
 d multiple comedy specials and albums that showcase his signature blend of
  tightly written jokes\, catchy \\(and occasionally naughty\\) songs\, and
  a performer’s instinct for balancing insight with irreverence.\n\nSourc

 Headliner: Phil Johnson “A benchmark of intelligent zaniness.” – The
  Milpitas Post “A ‘raging optimist’ is how Johnson describes himself
  and his comedy reflects his love of upbeat topics and eschews the snarky\
 , negative tone of many others.” – Solano Daily Republic “Comedian P
 hil Johnson tickles crowds with his jocular jams.” – The San Jose Metr
 o “Phil continued his show with intense energy to the very last joke. Hi
 s jokes spared no one and spun so quickly at times he would wait for the a
 udience to catch up. ” – The Copper Gazette\n\nBiography Phil Johnson 
 is a man who gets mistaken for a woman\, but only by those not paying atte
 ntion. That revelation kicks off a battle for self-awareness where comedy 
 and music are the weapons of choice. It’s a battle that has taken Phil t
 o such esteemed festivals as the Edinburgh Fringe and Sundance Film Festiv
 als and the Top 8 Finals of the World Series of Comedy .\n\n“I’ve alwa
 ys been the guy who isn’t quite what people expect\,” says Phil. Using
  that experience\, Phil pokes holes in the medical marijuana argument\, di
 scusses being a white guy at a hip hop show (and the innocent gestures tha
 t can get him in trouble)\, and reveals why Hawaii isn’t the paradise we
  think it is. From Shakespearean bees to redneck vampires to anthropomorph
 ic cell phones with weight issues\, Phil Johnson fills the stage with quir
 ky characters that combine social satire with absurdist flights of fancy. 
 Then the guitar comes out and kicks the show into an even higher gear with
  songs about the bright future (and dark past) of babies and what he would
  do if he woke up one morning as an actual woman.\n\nOn stage\, Phil’s p
 layful humor and likeable\, endearing manner allow him to shake things up 
 without antagonizing the audience. In the end we can only be who we are\, 
 try to understand others\, and hope they understand us.\n\n21+ Doors - 7p 
 / Show - 8p $15adv / $20door\n\nCheck out **www.BarrelProofLounge.com**

DESCRIPTION:SANTA ROSA -- Copperfield's Books welcomes award-winning autho
 r Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes to Montgomery Village for her stunning new novel 
 - The Pohaku. Embrace the Aloha spirit with a reading and warm discussion 
 followed by an audience Q&A and book signing. This is a free event\, regis
 tration recommended. From the award-winning author of Hula\, a dazzling sa
 ga that moves from Hawaii to California and back\, about the generations o
 f women tasked with protecting the history and place that made them. A you
 ng woman lies in a hospital bed in a coma\, watched over by her estranged 
 grandmother. Some say she jumped off the cliff\; others say she was swept 
 away by a wave. But her tutu at her bedside suspects something else is wro
 ng\, that the reason for the hardship and heartbreak in their family histo
 ry is tied to a story that she's never told-one about a powerful stone\, t
 he pohaku\, that her family was tasked with protecting generations ago. In
  fits and starts\, the grandmother begins . . . We travel back in time to 
 the eighteenth century\, when the explorer James Cook becomes the first Eu
 ropean to visit the Hawaiian Islands. Cook arrives in pursuit of an ancien
 t prophecy\, a key that would unlock the mysteries of the world\, but he i
 s killed before he can learn about the mysterious stone-a stone born along
 side future Hawaiian royalty\, the key to something even more powerful tha
 n Cook could have imagined. So begins a thrilling family saga of the women
  charged with protecting the pohaku\, as it is taken from Hawai'i to Calif
 ornia and possibly beyond\, bringing fortune to the well-intentioned and m
 isfortune to the bad. But with each successive generation\, the fractures 
 caused by its displacement widen until it becomes clear that the pohaku's 
 story must survive if there is to be any hope at all of the family's-and a
  nation's-reconciliation with their home\, with nature\, and with each oth
 er. Reminiscent of Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing\, Min Jin Lee's Pachinko\, and To
 mmy Orange's There\, There\, The Pohaku is an immersive and bold novel abo
 ut the history\, perseverance\, and resilience of the Hawaiian people. Aut
 hor: Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes was born and raised in Hilo\, Hawai'i. She is

DESCRIPTION:Grains of Sand is a positive “coming-of-age” story about 
 two women in their 80s. Filmed over eight years\, the documentary accompan
 ies the filmmaker’s mother and mother-in-law\, artists and close friends
 \, as they enter their ninth decade. The Grains of Sand Film Screening w
 ill be followed by a Collage Workshop designed to engage with the themes o
 f the film and use them to reflect on our own lives.\n\nTHE FILM\n\nMargot
  & Barbara\, close friends and artists\, meet for a work retreat in a ston
 e farmhouse in the German countryside. They are both about to turn 80. As 
 they begin to work on the large stones they have brought to sculpt\, they 
 embark on a conversation about creativity and aging\, exploring what it me
 ans for them to arrive at this stage of their lives. Their wrinkled hands 
 become dusty as they scrape and chisel the stones.\n\nTHE DISCUSSION\n\nWi
 th humor and empathy\, Grains of Sand demystifies the aging process and b
 uilds identification with the protagonists. The film collapses the experie
 nce of eight years into 85 minutes. This moving narrative arc invites peop
 le of all ages to engage with what it means to grow old and what matters m
 ost as we do so.\n\nTHE COLLAGE WORKSHOP\n\nArt for Barbara and Margot is 
 a way of living. Throughout the film\, art transcends the sensual experien
 ce to become also a way of reflecting on life itself.\n\nBuilding on the f
 ilm\, Collage Workshop participants will have a chance to experiment in a 
 tactile\, visual realm. We discuss scenes from the film which continue to 
 resonate for us\, and at the same time begin to play with color and shapes
  on the page. We can use the materials in front of us to fold in thoughts\
 , memories and references to lived events. Participants find themselves sh
 aring aspects of who they are and connecting with the other participants i
 n unexpected ways. The conversation with those around us at the table beco
 mes a dialogue with ourselves\, a kind of collage self-portrait in the mat
 erials we bring to paper.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 dquo\;\n\nLos Cien Program\n\nThe term Latinx emerged as an alternative to
  Latino and Latina\, aiming to provide gender inclusivity and cultural rec

 \, its adoption has sparked deep discussion and\, at times\, division with
 in our community.\n\nThis program invites a thoughtful\, respectful dialog
 ue about the evolution of this term &mdash\; exploring its linguistic root
 s\, social context\, and the varied perspectives it evokes among Latin Ame
 rican\, Chicano\, and Hispanic communities in Sonoma County and beyond. Th
 e goal is to foster understanding\, connection\, and belonging through an 
 informed and inclusive conversation that honors our community's diversity.

  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

SUMMARY:David Ramirez
DTSTART;TZID=PST;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260212T190000
DTEND;TZID=PST;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260212T190000

DESCRIPTION:How do you write love songs when you’re heartbroken? How do 
 you sing about hope and passion when yours is lost? How do you finish an a
 lbum when the relationship that inspired it has ended?\n\nDuring the Summe
 r of 2017\, David Ramirez had fallen in love with a woman who\, despite ha
 ving only just met\, felt incredibly familiar to him. There was a scary bu
 t comfortable feeling of deja vu within their moments together. “In past
  relationships\, no matter how eager I was to feel loved and to give love\
 , there had always been a hesitation to crawl out of my old life. I didn
 ’t feel this with her\,” he recollects.\n\nRamirez began to pen songs 
 for his next album and hopeful odes to new love spilled out. Songs like 
 “Lover\, Will You Lead Me?” filled with vivid images from the heart: I
  recognized you from some distant dream / Like when it rains on a cold day
  / I had a chill in my bones / Is it true what they say / “When you know
 \, you know.” \n\nThese were followed by sultry\, romantic ballads about
  how love matures and grows. He wrote “I Wanna Live In Your Bedroom” w
 hile sitting on his lover’s bed just minutes after waking up on a hazy f
 all day. “I was looking around at all the perfectly curated pieces in he
 r room\,” he says. “Everything was so intentional and held a story and
  a place in her heart. I wanted to be one of those pieces.”\n\nOne after
  another\, Ramirez poured his soul into a new work of art that covered bot
 h the sweet parts of love and the hard times it can bring. He wrote about 
 potential\, survival\, hope\, and encouragement. He wrote about partnershi
 p. \n\nBut art is often bred from spontaneity and suffers under the confin
 es of routines and borders. This is a conflicting dynamic that can cause m
 assive problems when you’re building a partnership\, when you’re part 
 of a team. A seeming “whatever” attitude can foster insecurity and dou
 bt in a lover. As more and more troubles emerged in his relationship\, Ram
 irez found solace still at the tip of his pen\, holding his guitar\, sitti
 ng at his piano. \n\n“I was born in August of 1983 just days after Hurri
 cane Alicia had hit my hometown of Houston. As my relationship began rippi
 ng at the seams\, I started to think of this storm as a precursor to my be
 ing born\,” Ramirez confides. “Was there something in the universe tha
 t imprinted a characteristic of chaos in my blood during my last few days 
 in the womb? Was I destined to wreak havoc everywhere I went?”\n\nSoon\,
  the relationship that had inspired a new burst of creativity in Ramirez a
 nd moved him to start writing an album unlike any he had ever attempted be
 fore\, came to an end. And with that ending\, he still had one last song t
 o write. His heart exhausted\, he sat on his patio one night and tried to 
 process all of the lyrics that he knew he had written\, yet now left him f
 eeling like a stranger to his own story. Through tears and muffled whimper
 s\, he started to write down all of his negative thoughts about love and p
 ut the pain of his broken heart into words. From this emotional purge\, he
  began to see the beauty in what he had gone through: the struggle\, the p
 ain\, the confusion. He soon found himself writing the lyrics that would b
 ecome album standout “Hallelujah\, Love Is Real!”\n\n“I was reminded
  of a great line in the film Vanilla Sky\, ‘The sweet is never as sweet 
 without the sour.’ I decided to celebrate Love\,” he explains. “I wa
 sn’t gonna write about how it made me feel in that moment. I was going t
 o write about its existence and how thankful I am having known it.”\n\nT
 his chapter of Ramirez’s life came to a close in the form of his forthco
 ming 10-song set\, My Love Is A Hurricane\, recorded with producer Jason B
 urt at Modern Electric Studios in Dallas\, TX. For the first time in his c
 areer\, he did no pre-production ahead of time\, working from gut feelings
  throughout the process and spending most of his time in the studio on the
  edge of his seat. The resulting R&B-influenced\, piano-driven production 
 is highlighted by heavy basslines and synths with the occasional gospel ba
 cking. This experimentation with new melodies and rhythms places Ramirez
 ’s deeply personal songwriting on top of dreamy\, groove-driven landscap
 es that heal the heart and promote positivity while prompting listeners to
  want to sing \\(and dance\\) along.\n\nMy Love Is A Hurricane is Ramirez
 ’s fifth full-length record and eighth collection of songs. Early albums
  like American Soil \\(2009\\) and Apologies \\(2012\\) put him on the map
  both locally and beyond\, while his STRANGETOWN \\(2011\\) and The Rooste
 r \\(2013\\) EPs delivered fan-favorite recordings\, “Shoeboxes” and 
 “The Bad Days respectively\, that are staple singalongs at his concerts 
 to this day. He made his Thirty Tigers debut with 2015’s FABLES\, produc
 ed by Noah Gundersen\, which features his most widely received single to d
 ate\, “Harder to Lie.” While this earlier work landed Ramirez firmly i
 n the singer/songwriter canon\, a need to do more exploring sonically led 
 to the expansive sound of his most recent album\, We’re Not Going Anywhe
 re \\(2017\\). Influenced by ‘80s bands like The Cars and Journey\, it i
 s lyrically reflective of the country’s intense political landscape fram
 ed from his perspective as a bi-racial American of Mexican heritage.\n\nAs
  songwriters evolve as people\, so does their art\, and that could not be 
 more apparent than on Ramirez’s newest offering. The soundscapes utilize
 d on My Love Is A Hurricane may be unlike any recording he has previously 
 crafted\, but it's not a departure from his journey. It's a new path creat
 ed in order to tell a new story. A new canvas needed to hold the scene tha
 t his intensely personal lyrics are painting.\n\n“David Ramirez has a vo
 ice like a tall tale\, one minute strong and thick\, the next threadbare a
 nd careworn.” — Stereogum\n\n“Mr. Ramirez is a resolutely hesitant s
 inger\, never pushing his hurt\, letting it instead decay him from within.
 ” — The New York Times\n\n“It's not easy for a writer to maintain th
 e aura of the unspoken in a song. Music and the space surrounding it inten
 sify the impact of confession\; the true challenge comes in giving voice t
 o a narrator who's tongue-tied\, or simply reticent. Texas singer-songwrit
 er David Ramirez does so beautifully…” — NPR Music\n\n“Quietly mes
 merizing” — The Wall Street Journal\n\n“A powerful voice and percept
 ive pen” — Austin Chronicle\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh

 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Li
 brary and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuse
 s on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event b
 ut we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look for
 ward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK The instant New York Times bestselle
 r • Oprah’s Book Club Pick • Named a Best Book of 2025 by TIME\, The
  New Yorker\, Harper's Bazaar\, USA Today\, NPR\, People\, Christian Scien
 ce Monitor\, Scientific American\, and Kirkus Reviews • A 2026 Andrew Ca
 rnegie Medal for Excellence finalist “Stunning . . . A heartfelt and pow
 erful examination of those living on the fringes of society\, and the uniq
 ue challenges they face to survive and thrive.” — Oprah Winfrey Ocean 
 Vuong returns with a bighearted novel about chosen family\, unexpected fri
 endship\, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. The harde
 st thing in the world is to live only once… One late summer evening in t
 he post-industrial town of East Gladness\, Connecticut\, nineteen-year-old
  Hai stands on the edge of a bridge in pelting rain\, ready to jump\, when
  he hears someone shout across the river. The voice belongs to Grazina\, a
 n elderly widow succumbing to dementia\, who convinces him to take another
  path. Bereft and out of options\, he quickly becomes her caretaker. Over 
 the course of the year\, the unlikely pair develops a life-altering bond\,
  one built on empathy\, spiritual reckoning\, and heartbreak\, with the po
 wer to transform Hai’s relationship to himself\, his family\, and a comm
 unity on the brink. Following the cycles of history\, memory\, and time\, 
 The Emperor of Gladness shows the profound ways in which love\, labor\, an
 d loneliness form the bedrock of American life. At its heart is a brave ep
 ic about what it means to exist on the fringes of society and to reckon wi
 th the wounds that haunt our collective soul. Hallmarks of Ocean Vuong’s
  writing—formal innovation\, syntactic dexterity\, and the ability to tw
 in grit with grace through tenderness—are on full display in this story 
 of loss\, hope\, and how far we would go to possess one of life’s most f
 leeting mercies: a second chance. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ocean Vuong is the auth
 or of the critically acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Woun
 ds and Time Is a Mother\, as well as the New York Times bestselling novel 
 On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous. A recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship
  and the American Book Award\, he was born in Saigon\, Vietnam\, and curre
 ntly splits his time between western Massachusetts and New York City. The 
 Emperor of Gladness is his latest novel.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 he Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery arti
 st.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists\, **Linda Ba
 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And

 R OF LOVE\n\nEXHIBIT DATES:  January 26 – February 22\, 2026\n\nRECEPTI
 ON: SATURDAY\, FEBRUARY 7\, 2026\, 3 – 5 pm: Join in to meet the artists
 \, celebrate the show and welcome the season of love. Take part in the Gal
 lery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  
 Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists\, Linda Barretta\, N
 ancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Shore\, Luba
  Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love\, paintings that bring o
 ut the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring 
 role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets\
 , blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart 
 is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicio
 us red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  fruit rendered so re
 alistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\, Schaffer and Zo
 rich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tu
 lips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered
  and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers 
 up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox pe
 ers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Show
 ering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stu
 nning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the
  fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious
  way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!\, a collection o
 f works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout
  the world\, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured\, suc
 h as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved pa
 rt of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold
  Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valen
 tine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.”
  Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMee

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an online discussion of this book! Each month\, th
 e Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one must-read book of poems\, w
 hether a timeless classic or an award-winning contemporary. Led by Napa po
 et Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusiastic book club member sinc
 e its beginning\, meetings are open to all levels of poetry readers\, both
  the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK One of the great poetic inn
 ovators of the 20th century\, the Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo now has a tr
 anslator worthy of his genius. The Peruvian poet César Vallejo—one of L
 atin America’s most famous poets—was involved in various literary circ
 les and began publishing his poems in 1914 in magazines\, after discoverin
 g the works of Walt Whitman\, the French symbolists\, and the modernist Ni
 caraguan poet Rubén Dario. He brought out his first book of poems in 1919
 \, Los heraldos negros\, and in 1922\, he published his famous Trilce\, wh
 ich met a cool reception. Vallejo spent many years of his life in Europe
 —in Paris and Spain. Like many of the surrealists\, he became a Marxist\
 , and he was an ardent supporter of the Republican cause during the Spanis
 h Civil War. In his poems\, Vallejo poignantly describes human misery\, is
 olation\, and anguish. As the translator Margaret Jull Costa explains: “
 Vallejo edited and redrafted and honed his poetry. This is the only way in
  which he could describe the antithetical\, paradoxical\, oxymoronic unive
 rse he was living in\, by using language at full tilt\, making it perform 
 all kinds of acrobatics. The resulting poems often defy interpretation…
 ” This marvelous new bilingual selection of poems spanning his career up
  to his early death confirms Robert Hass’s assessment that Vallejo was 
 “one of the essential poets of the twentieth century\, a heartbreaking a
 nd groundbreaking writer.” ABOUT THE AUTHOR César Vallejo was a Peruvia
 n poet\, who\, although he published just two books during his lifetime\, 
 is considered one of the great poetic innovators of the 20th century. Marg
 aret Jull Costa has won countless prizes for her translations from Portugu
 ese and Spanish. Patricio Ferrari is a poet\, translator\, and editor\, an
 d has translated the works of Pessoa and Alejandra Pizarnik among others. 
 Jerónimo Pizarro is Professor at the Universidad de los Andes and holds t
 he Camões Institute Chair of Portuguese Studies in Colombia. Jorge Uribe 
 has edited several editions of Pessoa’s works and translated various Por
 tuguese authors into Spanish.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb
 aud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid\, an OLLI instructor for Son

 SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry D

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

 ut the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring 
 role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets\
 , blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart 
 is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicio
 us red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  fruit rendered so re
 alistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\, Schaffer and Zo
 rich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tu
 lips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered
  and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers 
 up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox pe
 ers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Show
 ering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stu
 nning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the
  fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious
  way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!\, a collection o
 f works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout
  the world\, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured\, suc
 h as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved pa
 rt of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold
  Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valen
 tine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.”
  Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMee

  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th

 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

 al illustrations selected for their love related attributes. Instruction w
 ill cover core embroidery basics\, essential stitches and how to apply the
 m to an original collage custom printed on a 18×27” panel of linen cott
 on canvas. The end result is a beautifully embroidered textile that can be
  displayed as a wall hanging or utilized as a tea towel. Instruction will 
 set participants up for success so that they can begin their individual pr
 ojects in class and complete them at home.\n\nThe vintage floral illustrat
 ions were sourced from an 1896 volume of scientific studies in the collect
 ion of the Missouri Botanical Garden. They have been digitally restored an

DESCRIPTION:with Mark Coleman\n\nDo you experience challenges with focus a
 nd struggle with time and task management? Do you struggle with emotional 
 hypersensitivity or frustration tolerance? Do you find it hard to follow t
 hrough on tasks or commitments\, or to be reliable and consistent?\n\nIf s
 o\, you are not alone. Many people experience significant daily challenges
  with conditions related to executive functioning. These difficulties are 
 often associated with ADHD\, and may be exacerbated by our complex\, fast-
 paced\, high-tech lives. Such conditions often leave people with a sense o
 f self-doubt\, shame\, or unworthiness. The good news is that research on 
 mindfulness and compassion-based practices suggests that\, with appropriat
 e skills and supports\, it is possible to understand and function more eff
 ectively with care and wisdom.\n\nIn this daylong\, we’ll explore how th
 ese challenges interrupt daily functioning\, and how mindfulness\, forgive
 ness\, and self-compassion practices can be used to meet ADHD-related diff
 iculties with greater clarity and kindness.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 \n\n**The *New York Times* bestselling author of *The Paris Wife* weav
 es a mesmerizing tale of Paris above and below—where a woman’s quest f
 or artistic freedom in 1664 intertwines with a doctor’s dangerous missio
 n during the German occupation in the 1940s\, revealing a story of courage
  and resistance that transcends time.**\n\n1664: Alouette Voland is the da
 ughter of a master dyer at the famed Gobelin Tapestry Works\, who secretly
  dreams of escaping her circumstances and creating her own masterpiece. Wh
 en her father is unjustly imprisoned\, Alouette's efforts to save him lead
  to her own confinement in the notorious Salpêtrière asylum\, where thou
 sands of women are held captive and cruelly treated. But within its grim w
 alls\, she discovers a small group of brave allies\, and the possibility o
 f a life bigger than she ever imagined.\n\n1939: Kristof Larson is a medic
 al student beginning his psychiatric residency in Paris\, whose neighbors 
 on the Rue de Gobelins are a Jewish family who have fled Poland. When Nazi
  forces descend on the city\, Kristof becomes their only hope for survival
 \, even as his work as a doctor is jeopardized.\n\nA spellbinding and tran
 sportive look at a side of Paris known to very few—the underground city 
 that is a mirror reflection of the glories above—Paula McLain’s unforg
 ettable new novel chronicles two parallel journeys of defiance and rescue 
 that connect in ways both surprising and deeply moving.\n\n**Author: Paula

DESCRIPTION:**FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell**\n
 \n**Why Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does**\n\n**A 
 90-Minute interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeli
 ng stressed out and stuck.**\n\nFrom the author of *Ten Seconds of Boldne
 ss* and *Beyond Recovery*\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n
 \nSet goals. Made plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd ye
 t… something still isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who ar
 e doing “the right things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\
 , or creative endeavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrat
 ed underneath it all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re b
 roken. But because there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\n*
 *WHAT THEY DON’T TEACH YOU**\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Mo
 ve forward when confidence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking 
 without giving up responsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomp
 lete• Make progress without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself (a
 nd others) through uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded 
 in decades of **real-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle cu
 lture.**\n\nEverything you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\,

 n\n• Get clear about what you really want (not what you think you should
  want)\n\n• Stop waiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace p
 ressure with willingness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidenc
 e isn’t there yet\n\n**YOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:**\n\n• Greater clarity
  about what’s actually holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed 
 pressure• A renewed sense of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next s
 tep forward\n\n• A practical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype.

 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple

 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan

 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c

  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh

 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F

DESCRIPTION:Creating your estate plan\, whether it’s a living trust or a
  will\, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are 
 difficult to think about\, such as death\, incapacity\, finances\, and fam
 ily dynamics. It can be easy to procrastinate\, even though these issues m
 ay weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our upcom
 ing free seminars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mi
 nd by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational webi
 nar\, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and 
 how an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how wills and t
 rusts differ\, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to 
 avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you need to p
 rotect yourself and your family\, and leave a legacy of peace. If you woul
 d like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further\,
  we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free\, no obligation
  personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this seminar\, we 
 will discuss several common issues and concerns\, including:\n\n\\-The adv
 antages and disadvantages of wills\, living trusts\, and probate\n\n\\-Pro
 tecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses\, lawsu
 its\, and other claims\n\n\\-Most living trusts fail\; if you already have
  a trust\, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and
  your loved ones\n\n\\-How to preserve your nest egg for your family if yo
 u find yourself needing Long Term Care\n\n\\-How to stay out of court and 
 avoid the cost\, time\, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you
  become incapacitated.\n\n\\-Attend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obliga
 tion consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting u

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh

 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m

 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:Creating your estate plan\, whether it’s a living trust or a
  will\, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are 
 difficult to think about\, such as death\, incapacity\, finances\, and fam
 ily dynamics. It can be easy to procrastinate\, even though these issues m
 ay weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our upcom
 ing free seminars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mi
 nd by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational webi
 nar\, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and 
 how an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how wills and t
 rusts differ\, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to 
 avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you need to p
 rotect yourself and your family\, and leave a legacy of peace. If you woul
 d like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further\,
  we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free\, no obligation
  personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this seminar\, we 
 will discuss several common issues and concerns\, including:\n\n\\-The adv
 antages and disadvantages of wills\, living trusts\, and probate\n\n\\-Pro
 tecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses\, lawsu
 its\, and other claims\n\n\\-Most living trusts fail\; if you already have
  a trust\, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and
  your loved ones\n\n\\-How to preserve your nest egg for your family if yo
 u find yourself needing Long Term Care\n\n\\-How to stay out of court and 
 avoid the cost\, time\, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you
  become incapacitated.\n\n\\-Attend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obliga
 tion consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting u
 p your estate plan ($425 value).\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple

 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he

 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra

  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n
