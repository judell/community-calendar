DESCRIPTION:Venez fêter avec nous! \nGrab your Valentine (or Gal-entine) and slip away to Little Saint for a charming\, Paris-themed morning in Healdsburg with beloved author Paula McLain and celebrated Francophile Rebecca Plotnick (@everydayparisian). \nWe’re serving full French vibes – steaming coffee\, elegant teas\, flaky croissants\, and a sprinkle of Parisian magic courtesy of Little Saint and neighboring art galleries. Think winter-morning-on-the-Left-Bank energy… just on the Plaza and with better books! \nDoors open at 9:00am\, giving you time to linger\, sip\, and settle in before heading upstairs for the 10:00am event. \nJoin us for a reading and curated discussion followed by an audience Q&A and post event book signing with photo opportunities. \nThis is a ticketed event\, each ticket package includes a signed copy of Paula’s new book Skylark. Signed copies of Rebecca’s beautiful gift book Paris Every Day will also be available for purchase during the ticket registration process and on-site at the event. \nA perfect gathering for Francophiles\, book lovers\, and anyone ready for a little everyday joie de vivre with their favorite people! \nAbout Skylark: \nThe New York Times bestselling author of The Paris Wife weaves a mesmerizing tale of Paris above and below—where a woman’s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 intertwines with a doctor’s dangerous mission during the German occupation in the 1940s\, revealing a story of courage and resistance that transcends time. \n1664: Alouette Voland is the daughter of a master dyer at the famed Gobelin Tapestry Works\, who secretly dreams of escaping her circumstances and creating her own masterpiece. When her father is unjustly imprisoned\, Alouette’s efforts to save him lead to her own confinement in the notorious Salpêtrière asylum\, where thousands of women are held captive and cruelly treated. But within its grim walls\, she discovers a small group of brave allies\, and the possibility of a life bigger than she ever imagined. \n1939: Kristof Larson is a medical student beginning his psychiatric residency in Paris\, whose neighbors on the Rue de Gobelins are a Jewish family who have fled Poland. When Nazi forces descend on the city\, Kristof becomes their only hope for survival\, even as his work as a doctor is jeopardized. \nA spellbinding and transportive look at a side of Paris known to very few—the underground city that is a mirror reflection of the glories above—Paula McLain’s unforgettable new novel chronicles two parallel journeys of defiance and rescue that connect in ways both surprising and deeply moving. \nAuthor: Paula McLain is the New York Times bestselling author of six novels\, including The Paris Wife\, Circling the Sun\, and Love and Ruin\, as well as two collections of poetry and a memoir. Her work has been published in over thirty-five countries\, and featured in The New York Times\, The Guardian\, Town & Country\, Real Simple\, and elsewhere. \nAbout Paris Every Day: \nWhether you’re a seasoned traveler or a first-time visitor\, enjoy the magical view of Paris in this book from Everyday Parisian blogger\, Rebecca Plotnick. \nParis Every Day reveals the City of Light through Rebecca’s photography and offers you the insider knowledge to help cultivate a French frame of mind. \nParis is more than a destination\, it’s a lifestyle. Chocolate or espresso\, flower market or Mus e d’Orsay\, a small park or a favorite rooftop–you’ll find ideas for scouting these and more with photographs that reflect Rebecca’s decades-long love affair with the city. \nParis Every Day is a sublime sortie that explores jazz bars\, picnic spots\, and casual bistros. Find advice for each season\, including how to dress like a Parisian and indulge in the freshest regional produce. All bolstered by fabulous photos that include landmarks like the Luxembourg Gardens and the Eiffel Tower as well as prime places to people watch. \nIt’s not just about the sights; it’s how to best enjoy them. Whether you’re planning a trip or just want an escape\, you will turn to this book again and again for Rebecca’s well-curated wisdom on relishing everyday moments in the City of Light. \nAuthor: Rebecca Plotnick is American and the founder of Every Day Parisian blog. In 2013\, she decided to pack up all her belongings and left Chicago for what would become a nomadic way of living for two years between the United States and France. Everyday Parisian was founded in 2016 as a result of this desire to meld the French lifestyle with American surroundings and to create a community with a shared love for Paris. It aims to highlight the fun and new ways to “frenchify” daily life\, offers travel recommendations\, shares fashion inspiration\, and much more.Rebecca’s photographic work has been featured by Pottery Barn for the past decade and has recently been acquired by Ikea.

SUMMARY:The Freak Accident Record Release Party at The Big Easy
DESCRIPTION:w/ Cut-Rate Druggist and Right To Remain \nRecord release party celebrating the seventh release from The Freak Accident (members of Victims Family\, Hellbillys\,Mongoloid and much more) entitled “The Midnight Show” which drops everywhere on February 6th. \nThe Freak Accident is a Punk/Math/Garage/Pop/Surf/Rock collision led by Victims Family/Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine guitarist-vocalist Ralph Spight. Through numerous line-up they’ve cranked out 4 LP’s and 2 EP’s of genre-hopping smart-ass punk and rock\, equal parts comedy and tragedy and a healthy side of psychedelic noise. The new line-up of bassist Henry Austin Lannan and “Stark Raving” Brad Kopp (Hellbillys\,Marginal Prophets\,Antler Family\,Stark Raving Brad) on drums dropped their first LP/CD together entitled “Outer Space Is Boring” (Nerve Center\, 2023) and has performed throughout Northern California in support of that release playing shows with Dead Bob\, Supersuckers\, The Hangmen\,Middle-Aged Queers\, The Darts and many others and have played after-parties at Mosswood Meltdown. Their new album “The Midnight Show” is a co-release with Nadine Records (the adventurous Portland label run by Nasalrod/Berzerk bass legend Mandy Morgan) is a kitchen sink of punk\,indie\,noise\,psych and surf textures that surprises with every listen. It hits the streets on February 6th\,2026 with regional and national tour dates to follow. \nCut-Rate Druggist is a dynamic duo characterized by dual vocals intertwined with heavy drums and a bass guitar\, culminating in a crushing wall of sound. Their powerful presence on stage earned them opportunities to support renowned acts such as Team Dresch\, Beyond The Lamplight\, The Avengers\, Margaritas Podridas\, The Dollyrots and Betty Blowtorch. \nPetaluma’s own Right To Remain open the show and bring their frantic impassioned hardcore that’s made them a favorite all over Northern California.\n\nSource: GoLocal Cooperative

DESCRIPTION:Tom Relling\n\n\nWednesday\, February 11\, 2026 at 5:00PM\nTune in Wednesday\, February 11 at 5PM to watch an exclusive Luther Locals Online recording of Tom Relling on our Facebook page! \n\n\nBorn in Pasadena CA and raised in St. Louis MO\, songwriter and guitarist Tom Relling landed in San Francisco in 2010\, and soon established himself as a musical presence in the Bay Area scene. Tom’s hard rock spin on power-pop has drawn comparisons to acts of the 60’s and 70’s (think T Rex meets MC5) merging clever lyrics\, catchy melodies\, and stunning guitar work. With dynamic stagecraft and top-tier musicianship of rhythm section Alex Dang-Lozano (drums) and Will Durkee (bass)\, Tom Relling Band consistently delivers full-tilt live performances\, uplifting and astounding audiences with high energy guitar-based rock n’roll. New LP “Peace In Love” is out now on Shaky Records. \nAll views expressed in this broadcast are those of the artist.\n\nSource: Luther Burbank Center

The longtime Sonoma County friends first appeared in Love Letters in 2016. \nTicket sales for the play will raise much-needed funds for YWCA’s vital and singular domestic violence programs serving local families who find themselves in danger in their homes – the place we should all feel safest. For 50 years\, YWCA Sonoma County has been the county’s answer to the need by families for refuge\, advocacy\, and support with domestic violence. \nLove Letters is based on the lifelong\, intimate correspondence of these two characters whose entire story unfolds through written words exchanged in the form of letters. In a relationship spanning 50 years\, their letters contain their hopes and ambitions\, dreams and disappointments\, victories and defeats throughout their separate lives. \nAfter debuting in 1988\, Love Letters quickly moved to both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. Over the years\, the roles were performed by notable actors such as Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow\, Carol Burnett with Dennehy\, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen\, as well as Angelica Huston and Stacy Keach\, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. \nAccording to Madeleine Keegan O’Connell\, “In addition to the basic needs of food\, clothing and shelter\, people deserve respect\, dignity and safety to conduct productive lives and care for their children. YWCA is honored to be a leader in the efforts to address needs so many people take for granted.”  \nChris Smith\, who retired from the PD in 2021 but still contributes to the newspaper on occasion\, said\, “Bringing the power of the written word and the lost art of letter writing together with support for YWCA Sonoma County is a winning combination for me.” \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus\, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.\n\nSource: Luther Burbank Center

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura

  lead a song\, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather
  just singalong with the chantey choruses\, that's fine too. We always hav

 \n\nIn this delightful\, laugh-a-minute comedy\, four unique Southern wome

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi

 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?*

 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo

DESCRIPTION:There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feel
 s like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way
 . His voice is raw and real\, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’
 s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest\, and that’s
  exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Am
 ericana\; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie\, blues lege
 nds like Howlin’ Wolf\,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe\, an
 d master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and c
 onnects audiences\, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren
 ’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s so
 ft and haunting\, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay wi
 th you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sou
 nd. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness\, conn
 ection\, love\, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band s
 how\, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOv
 er the years\, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless to
 uring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists 
 like Shakey Graves\, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\, Sarah Jarosz\, and Alic
 e O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock\, SXSW\, and High Si
 erra Music Festival\, but his focus has always been on making music that m
 eans something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending y
 ears on the road\, self-funding his albums\, and navigating the ups and do
 wns of life as an independent artist\, husband\, and father. But through i
 t all\, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music th
 at connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real\, that makes
  you stop and listen\, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.\n\nSo

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat
 erials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:“If I was forced to categorize it\, I’d call it modern fol
 k. It’s powerful\, romantic\, and giddy. And the two are insanely infect
 ious together onstage\, like a musical and a personal love fest all at onc
 e.”  – Huffington Post  With more than a dozen albums and over a thous
 and shows between them\, Ty Greenstein and Ingrid Elizabeth of Mouths of B
 abes are no strangers to the contemporary folk music scene. For years\, th
 eir respective bands Girlyman and Coyote Grace captivated thousands of loy
 al fans as they criss-crossed the country\, rocked festival main stages\, 
 and toured with the likes of the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Now\, as M
 ouths of Babes\, Ty and Ingrid have distilled the very best of the songwri
 ting\, musicianship\, and humor of their previous groups into a new duo th
 at brings more style and depth than ever before.  Mouths of Babes recorded
  their highly anticipated first full-length album\, Brighter In the Dark a
 t Prairie Sun Studios in northern California last summer on the strength o
 f a wildly successful\, 800-backer\, $56\,000 Kickstarter campaign. Releas
 ed in January 2017\, the self-produced album contains twelve original song
 s with contrasting themes of light and dark\, tragedy and comedy\, persona
 l and political. Mixed by Stewart Lerman \\(Dar Williams\, Bob Dylan\\)\, 
 Brighter features guest appearances from Birds of Chicago\, Tania Elizabet
 h \\(The Avett Brothers\\)\, Mai Bloomfield \\(Jason Mraz\\) and others.  
 No Depression writes\, “Mouths of Babes could never have predicted how n
 ecessary Brighter In The Dark \\[would be\\] in a post-Trump world. The al
 bum title is fitting. We need music that shows people struggling against s
 ocial expectations\, that reminds us that we all have the resilience we ne
 ed to make it through.” Thinking Lyrically blog gives the album 9 stars 
 out of 10: "An eclectic arsenal of songs\, showcasing their knack for fusi
 ng blues\, folk\, and soul with poetic lyrics \\[and\\] great choruses...a
 n incredibly versatile record. One of my new favourite listens.”  The ke
 y to the Mouths of Babes magic is in the contrast\; the differences in bot
 h their songwriting and personal styles makes for an unusually satisfying 
 yin and yang. Of their live show\, the Chicago Tribune writes\, “They of
 fer unique counterpoints to one another…the laidback Ty\, nattily dresse
 d in a tie and crisp suit jacket\, has a rich\, lovely alto. Ingrid\, clad
  in a sultry pink satin mini-dress\, is a sassy chanteuse with a lilting s
 oprano. Trading jokes and sharing elegant harmonies\, the two women displa
 y an intuitive professional bond.” They easily switch off lead vocals an
 d play a wide array of instruments\, with Ty on acoustic and electric guit
 ars and foot percussion\, and Ingrid playing upright bass\, ukulele\, and 
 cajon.  Onstage\, Ty makes a quiet impression as a gifted lyricist\, talen
 ted multi-instrumentalist\, and magnetic presence. “The poignant honesty
  that Ty brings to \\[her\\] tunes gives them an emotional intensity that
 ’s as bracing as it is moving\,” says Relix Magazine.  The Americana G
 azette writes\, “Ty’s practice of extending metaphors out toward a pre
 cipice keeps an unpredictable edge to her songs. Most writers would stop a
 t the easy close. Ty jumps\, leaving much to the imagination\, to powerful
  effect.” Ingrid\, a natural performer\, easily commands audiences with 
 her larger-than-life sassiness and professional dancer’s grace. "With a 
 background in burlesque\, sex-education\, and good ol' American roots musi
 c\," writes Kithfolk\, "Ingrid Elizabeth brings a ton of charisma to her p
 erformances." Curve Magazine calls Ingrid “the fiery redheaded bassist..
 .the unabashed\, unapologetic woman who isn’t afraid to yell it all from
  the rooftops.”  Both Ingrid and Ty come from notable musical families\,
  and their influences \\(namely\, 60’s folk music and Motown\\) are deep
 ly embedded in Mouths of Babes’ sound. Ty’s father\, Ron Greenstein\, 
 is a member of the legendary folk harmony trio The Chad Mitchell Trio \\(w
 here John Denver got his start\\)\, while Ingrid’s uncle Tom Eyen wrote 
 the world-famous\, Tony-winning musical Dreamgirls.  MTV News writes: “T
 he songs Mouths of Babes writes and performs together fuse blues\, folk\, 
 and soul\, and the depth of emotion found in their lyrics is reminiscent o
 f all that’s moving about the Dreamgirls soundtrack.”  “Hands down t
 he best new music I've heard in years. It's damn near perfect. The instrum
 ental performances\, the arrangements\, the production\, the songwriting a
 nd singing…this is the kind of music that makes you glad to be alive. 
 ” – Michael Mullane\, Cafe Veritas Mouths of Babes is Ty Greenstein \\
 (Girlyman\\) & Ingrid Elizabeth \\(Coyote Grace\\). Equal parts celebratio
 n and blues. Folky\, soulful deliciousness. Get some.\n\nSource: North Bay

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?*

 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a
 s the paper is drawing quality)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed charco
 al (Char-kole brand black)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Staedtler d
 rawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one m
 edium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and a

 e Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinv
 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every
  year.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

  “CONTEMPORARY BLUES FEMALE ARTIST OF THE YEAR”\n\n2020 BMA WINNER “
 HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR!” \n\n2019 BMA WINNER “HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR
 !” \n\n“There’s a young lady \\[Vanessa Collier\\] came onstage with
  me\, I forget where I was\, but she’s playing an alto saxophone\, and m
 an\, she was amazing.”\n\n Those are the words of Buddy Guy in an issue 
 of American Blues Scene\, describing an impromptu performance with Vanessa
  Collier on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise. If you haven’t been for
 tunate enough to meet Vanessa and witness one of her head-turning\, fiery\
 , and passionate performances\, you should definitely make sure you do. As
  a master musician and multi-instrumentalist\, Vanessa Collier\, weaves fu
 nk\, soul\, rock\, and blues into every powerful performance and she is do
 wnright impressive. With soulful vocals\, searing saxophone\, and witty so
 ngwriting\, Vanessa is blazing a trail\, racking up an impressive arsenal 
 of honours\, and has already singled herself out as an artist of distincti
 on and one we would all do well to watch.\n\nIt’s not simply the accolad
 es she has accumulated so far\, although they’ve been many -- two Blues 
 Music Awards for “Horn Player of the Year”\, and a third BMA for “Co
 ntemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”\, eight Blues Music Award No
 minations \\(BMAs\\)\, a Blues Blast Award nomination\, the Jammingest Pro
  Award bestowed by the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise\, First Place for l
 yrics in the International Songwriting Competition\, Best of 2014 Blues Br
 eaker on Dan Aykroyd’s BluesMobile -- it’s the fact that she has accum
 ulated all these honours even while her career is still in its infancy. A 
 2013 graduate of the prestigious Berklee College of Music\, she’s toured
  nationally and internationally\, released four critically acclaimed album
 s \\(2014’s Heart\, Soul & Saxophone\, 2017’s Meeting My Shadow\, and 
 2018’s Honey Up\, 2020’s Heart On The Line. Honey Up spent 9 weeks ato
 p the Billboard Blues Album Charts Top 15\, 3 months on the Living Blues C
 harts at \\#10 and \\#23\, and continues to be spun on Sirius XM’s B.B. 
 King’s Bluesville radio station! \n\nIt’s not surprising that the pres
 s has been quick to commend her efforts as well. Blues Blast Magazine affi
 rms\, “Vanessa Collier is a fresh face on the American blues scene\, and
  in addition to her soulful vocals\, she brings a mighty sax to the table.
 ..” Blues Music Magazine proclaims\, “Collier is a fresh face who come
 s to the blues stage carrying her reed instruments\, a dual degree from Be
 rklee College of Music in Boston\, a major label debut\, almost two years 
 of touring with Joe Louis Walker\, and a mature musical vision…Collier c
 ommands center stage with her vocals\, soloing\, and stage presence.” Mi
 dwest Record exclaims\, “This bluesy singing sax player knows how to bri
 ng the slinking funk to her captivating\, award winning sound that has ech
 oes in young Bonnie Raitt/Maria Muldaur vocal sounds…Killer stuff on eve
 ry level\, this sounds like one of the reasons you first became a music fa
 n. Killer stuff.” and AXS.Com declares that she “might as well go ahea
 d and add another shelf to her trophy case because clearly\, she’s going
  to need it. With a voice that often recalls that of blues-rock stalwart B
 onnie Raitt\, Collier turns up the heat...”\n\nHaving first picked up th
 e saxophone at the age of nine\, Collier embarked on her road to recogniti
 on at Berklee\, earning dual degrees in Performance and Music Production &
  Engineering. While still completing her degree\, Collier landed a positio
 n touring with Joe Louis Walker for a year and a half before Joe encourage
 d her to strike out on her own. And strike out she did.\n\nThese days\, Co
 llier spends much of her time on the road\, performing at some of the most
  prestigious music festivals in the world. Her talents have taken her to t
 he Blues Music Awards Show where\, in the words of the Blues Foundation\, 
 Vanessa “blew the doors off the Blues Music Awards!”\; Ottawa Blues Fe
 stival\, where she earned two front page newspaper photos and rave reviews
  after her foot stomping debut there\; twice on the Legendary Rhythm and B
 lues Cruise\, where she earned the Jammingest Pro Award and was a featured
  artist with Tommy Castro’s Blues Review\; Briggs Farm Festival\, where 
 she was the “most popular Briggs Farm act in 2017” \\(Elmore Magazine\
 \)\, and the list continues. \n\nVanessa has won 3 Blues Music Awards - tw
 o for “Horn Player of the Year” in 2019 and 2020 and one in 2022 for 
 “Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”!! She has been nominate
 d for eight Blues Music Awards since 2017\, which puts her in elite compan
 y with artists such as Beth Hart\, Samantha Fish\, Shemekia Copeland\, Rut
 hie Foster\, Trombone Shorty\, Al Basile\, and Jimmy Carpenter.\n\nAs for 
 Collier\, she says she’s happy performing on stages across the world\, h
 oping that she can make a difference with fans and followers along the way
 . “I am driven to do this because I find it a total form of expression a
 nd connection\,” she explains. “I love connecting with an audience and
  feeling their energy and I hope to inspire people to follow their dreams 
 and passions\, to find what brings them joy\, and then to pursue it dogged
 ly.” Vanessa also takes that message to young people as she runs clinics
  across the country and is active with Blues in the Schools programs. At a
  recent Blues in the School program\, Vanessa invited a stage full of elem
 entary and middle school aged kids up to dance around her while she perfor
 med a blues shuffle. Watching the joy on the faces of Vanessa\, the kids\,
  and everyone in the auditorium\, it is no wonder why Vanessa has become a
 we-inspiring to all who meet her. On top of talent and hard work\, Vanessa
  shares an incredible heart and a strong purpose. To borrow from the words
  of an article in Blues Blast Magazine\, “Vanessa is an important part o
 f the future of the blues\, and it would be cool to support her journey."\

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat
 erials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bo

SUMMARY:A Year to Live

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260328T130000
UID:251217QPY7A6yiW0GalpwoX-j7gw
DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w
 ill determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works
  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\
 + monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio r
 ecording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Plat
 form\n\nQ&As: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

  The music\, message & intention trancends all that\, forget the borders a
 nd waters that divide us\, the movement is to ignite the great remembrance
  of who we are\, our collective power\, what we can be\, to break the ment
 al conditioning and find full freedom in this lifetime.\n\nThe Nattali Riz
 e project launched out of Jamaica into the US\, EU and beyond in 2014 with
  a strong run of captivating festival performances and national club shows
 . Now with tours alongside the likes of Michael Franti and Spearhead\, Kat
 chafire\, Third World\, J-Boog\, Julian Marley\, Tribal Seeds and more und
 er their belt\, the worldwide movement is ever rizing!\n\nThis is a global
  mash up of raw energy and vibe that together has been rocking stages sinc
 e the band first burst onto the scene in 2015.\n\nAsk Nattali where she co
 mes from\, she’ll tell you “All Directions”\, with no fixed address\
 , Nattali is now based where the music takes her\, Nattali Rize claims not

 urselves of our individual and collective power to live life to the fulles
 t and recognize our selves and each other as evolving beings of light. A r
 eality of Full Freedom is a possibility on this earth and in these times. 
 We use music to sound frequencies infused with this idea\, and to resonate
  at a higher level than what is currently being permeated across current w
 orld culture. People are powerful\; we want them to reclaim that power and
  no longer be servants to a system that has never\, and will never\, serve
  them to their fullest potential. As such\, our frequency in this system i

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a
 s the paper is drawing quality)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed charco
 al (Char-kole brand black)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Staedtler d
 rawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one m
 edium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and a
 bove receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every

 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs

  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat

DESCRIPTION:Against the backdrop of over 25 years of creative collaboratio
 n\, Ben Allison\, Steve Cardenas\, and Ted Nash weave musical conversation
 s that are full of subtlety and surprise. They take turns arranging for th
 e trio\, which has released four albums. For this concert\, they will be p
 laying a selection of music from each of their recordings: Quiet Revolutio
 n: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre and Jim Hall\, Somewhere Else:
  which features our arrangements of songs from Leonard Bernstein’s West 
 Side Story\, Quiet Revolution: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre an
 d Jim Hall\, Healing Power: which features music by the iconic composer/ar
 ranger Carla Bley and Tell the Birds I Said Hello: which features previous
 ly unrecorded gems by the genius pianist/composer Herbie Nichols. To date\
 , their albums have been streamed millions of times\, and they have perfor
 med at countless festivals throughout Europe\, the US\, and South America.
  The group is modeled after reedist/composer Jimmy Giuffre’s drummerless
  trios of the 1950s and 60s. As jazz was becoming more expressionistic and
  at times bombastic\, musicians like Giuffre were going in the opposite di
 rection. They were envisioning quieter music that maintained elements of b
 lues and folk while also embracing the emerging qualities of free playing.
  Ben\, Steve and Ted create music that is intimate and highly conversation
 al in tone—a ‘musical trialogue\,’ where group interplay is the focu
 s.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:You can’t water old flowers. Yes\, you fall in love\, you ma
 ke mistakes\, and so do they. You run through blackberry fields in the sum
 mer of your youth\, dream in passenger seats gazing past towns and fields\
 , imagining a future life where everything works out. I fell head over hee
 ls in love at nineteen. The kind of love where you call up your best frien
 d and say\, “I think I’ve found my soulmate.” The pull towards that 
 first true love is strong. It consumes you\, makes you question your own d
 reams. \n\nWe taught each other\, grew up together\, we were family. We fi
 t just right\, for a time. Then one day\, after a long and rocky nine year
  road\, life changed and became a complicated mess too hard to untangle. W
 e couldn’t get our love back\, no matter how many dreams that shadowed t
 his hard truth. We grew resentful\, selfish\, harboring past mistakes and 
 holding them up like armor from every blow. We grew up and our paths diver
 ted. \n\nOn New Year’s Day\, 2018\, a great horned owl dropped dead at m
 y exes’ feet in my mother’s yard. It felt like a daunting omen\, usher
 ing on change for the both of us. We were distraught. We couldn’t afford
  the taxidermy\, so we placed it in a big blue plastic garbage bin. Now it
  felt so cheap\, that mystic creature in a plastic coffin. That’s how lo
 ve feels sometimes – like we don’t serve it the ending it deserves. \n
 \nThe omen was true. That year\, I started to see the woman I could be\, t
 he woman I wasn’t yet. Anytime I felt like myself\, I was alone and wand
 ering\, and I knew that was a sign that it was time for change. New Year
 ’s Day 2019\, I said goodbye to my first true love and moved across the 
 country. Losing someone you spend every day for nearly a decade with is in
 tense. We talked in our dreams. I knew where he was\, even before I entere
 d a place. He’d always be there if I had a feeling. Humans are connected
  in unexplainable ways. \n\nI was writing a lot after we broke up as a hea
 ling technique\, preserving each memory like an emotional archaeologist. L
 ate one night\, I woke up from a dream where I was searching for him\, my 
 ex\, at a carnival. It was so vivid. I woke myself up to write a song on m
 y piano. The next morning\, he reached out to me for the first time in mon
 ths. We went out\, had a drink\, caught up\, and he told me that the harde
 st part about our separation was a reoccurring nightmare where he searched
  for me at a carnival. In that moment\, I knew\, humans have ways of conne
 cting beyond words and touch. I truly believe that. We had the same dream\
 , without seeing each other for months. \n\nEven with all the mystic symbo
 lism that year presented\, this is an age-old story I can’t make up. We 
 fall in love\, we grow up\, we change\, and they don’t change with us. 
 ‘Old Flowers’ is about heartbreak. There are a million records and son
 gs about that\, but I did not lie when writing these songs. This album is 
 about loving and caring for the person you know you can’t be with. It’
 s about being afraid to be vulnerable after you’ve been hurt. It’s abo
 ut a woman who is alone\, but okay with that\, if it means truth. \n\nThis
  was my truth this year – my nine year relationship ended\, and I’m a 
 woman alone in the world\, but happy to know herself.  \n\nThese songs cam
 e to me alone\, late nights in Bisbee\, Lisbon\, Nashville\, and London. S
 ometimes I’d just cry and sing\, and a song would come out. I drank too 
 much wine while writing this record\, lit too many candles. You could say 
 this was my attempt to summon the muse\, but that’s bullshit\, because s
 he was just standing there naked looking me in the eyes. So I told her the
  truth. \n\nThis is my story of the most heartbreaking\, but soul-revealin
 g\, year of my life. I drove myself mad. I drove to the smoky mountains ju
 st to drive back. I danced with a Portuguese boxer and cried on his should
 er in a Fado cafe. I did everything an artist is “supposed to do.” But
  at the end of the day\, beyond all the romance\, these songs are my truth
 . I think they might be yours too.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260407T190000
UID:251222qDbjR_wsQkagQmDbLz7wsA
DESCRIPTION:Maybe a minute passed before I knew I’d be singing “Karaok
 e” for the rest of my life. The second song on Heartmind\, the tenth alb
 um by Cass McCombs\, “Karaoke” is a god-level burst of power-pop perfe
 ction\, as fetching as anything Cass has ever cut. The springy staccato gu
 itar\, the vaporized electric keys\, the melody seemingly born for singing
  or clapping or dancing along: Cass triangulates a perch of his very own o
 ut among The Go-Betweens\, The dB’s\, and The Cure\, and vibrates there\
 , a beacon. And then\, of course\, there is the song’s playful if painfu
 l lyrical conceit—the lover who is making all the sacred motions of comm
 itment but whose feelings may be no more deep or real than someone simply 
 reading the lyrics for “Vision of Love” or “Stand by Your Man” fro
 m some crowded bar’s TV screen.  \n\n \n\nSo after harmonizing alone wit
 h “Karaoke” for the twentieth time during a solo cross-country drive\,
  I had to ask Cass for myself how it all went down: Was this heartbreak\, 
 or was it legit love? He paused\, thought\, then laughed. “Well\, that
 ’s the question\,” he said slowly. “Neither?” Or maybe\, he finall
 y averred\, both? That is—to me\, anyway—the true joy of Heartmind\, a
 n eight-song album that feels more like a journey among assorted tuneful f
 eelings\, somehow shaped to meet whatever it is a particular listener need
 s\, to mirror whatever they bring to these uniformly incandescent and trag
 icomic tracks. Cass has set the stage\, but you get to pick the heroes and
  villains\, the winners and losers\, the jokes and the drags. He doesn’t
  want to give you the questions\, let alone the answers.  \n\n \n\nTo wit:
  Did the soldier at the center of the aching country epic “Unproud Warri
 or” abdicate responsibility or finally claim it? As the percussion shuff
 les and horns sigh beneath “Krakatau\,” will you agree that you can be
  cleansed without being killed—or be anything better than you already ar
 e while still remaining yourself? Do you identify with being enraptured by
  music for so long that it ultimately drained you\, too\, as Cass suggests
  \\(maybe?\\) during the wiry opener\, “Music Is Blue”? These are just
  a few of the questions that come to mind when I hear Heartmind\, but I do
 n’t even know if they’re the right questions. Still\, I can now sing a
 long to every word. \n\n \n\nThere are\, at least\, some basic facts to sh
 are about Heartmind\, logistical evidence that may in turn shape your own 
 questions: Cass recorded these songs in multiple sessions on both coasts\,
  in Brooklyn and Burbank. The great Shahzad Ismaily not only cut the stagg
 ering “Unproud Warrior” and four others here but also played lots of b
 ass. Buddy Ross tracked “New Earth\,” a paean of post-humanity renewal
  with several sharp wisecracks. Ariel Rechtshaid—now a dozen years into 
 his collaboration with Cass\, which began with 2009’s Catacombs—captur
 ed Cass’ scintillating guitars on “Belong to Heaven\,” a thoughtful 
 consideration of what we all lose when we lose an old friend to the inevit
 able end. The steadfast Rob Schnapf \\(who previously produced McCombs’ 
 ANTI- debut\, Mangy Love\\) mixed and merged it all.  \n\n \n\nWynonna Jud
 d \\(yes\, that one\\) offers harmonies\, while her beau Cactus Moser prov
 ides some lap steel. Joe Russo\, Kassa Overall\, Danielle Haim\, Nestor Go
 mez: I don’t actually need to tell you how good everyone who pitches in 
 here is\, because you’ll be able to hear it for yourself the moment you 
 listen. \n\n \n\nSpeaking of hearing it for yourself\, here’s how I hear
  at least some of these songs: “Unproud Warrior\,” featuring the afore
 mentioned Wynonna\, is a necessary anthem for these times\, where we all s
 eem to have opinions about the critical news of the day without ever quite
  knowing what to do about it. Invoking Stephen Crane\, S.E. Hinton\, and f
 ast-food restaurants\, it is an allegory about our perception and ownershi
 p of responsibility\, set to an elegant C&W ache. “New Earth” celebrat
 es the renewal that’s possible when humanity’s finally done with its b
 ullshit\, when all our temporary madness self-destructs long enough to let
  nature reset itself. Sorry\, but you’ll be humming along to predictions
  of your own destruction here. And using much of the same band of rootsy w
 eirdos as “Unproud Warrior\,” “Blue Blue Band” unfurls as a sequel
  to Gillian Welch’s Ruination Day suite\, where the offering up of onese
 lf for entertainment always entails at least a sliver of self-destruction.
  Also\, Cass sings that the bassist\, Fritz\, “cooks it hotter than grit
 s\,” which is about all any Southerner needs to hear in order to love an
 y song. \n\n \n\nAt the risk of being didactic\, I need to reiterate somet
 hing here: Aside from the credits\, I might be wrong about everything I’
 ve said about these songs. Again\, sorry. Where I hear dark humor\, you mi
 ght hear relentless pain\; where I hear winning cynicism\, you might hear 
 harrowing nihilism. And that is\, in some way\, the point for Cass—to wr
 ite songs that speak of his moment\, and then let everyone else decide how
  or even if they speak to their moment. These are honest offerings for abs
 urdist times\, funny confessions of frailty amid circumstances that often 
 seem too tense for even the humble chuckle. On Heartmind\, Cass McCombs en
 ters the double-digit-album phase of his career\, a quantitatively rarifie
 d place for any songwriter\; rarer still\, though\, is the fact that he do
 es not yet seem to have settled into a qualitative sound or pattern\, of s
 inging the same thought twice \\(or perhaps even once\\).  \n\n \n\nOne mo
 re thing I can say for certain\, then? For Cass\, this has never been kara
 oke. —Grayson Haver Currin\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a
 s the paper is drawing quality)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed charco
 al (Char-kole brand black)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Staedtler d

DESCRIPTION:If you like the sound of Laura Marling\, Lucinda Williams\, Gi
 llian Welch\, Emmylou Harris... then this is a concert for your taste.\n\n
 Sofia Talvik is a rare artist and an avid storyteller with a voice compara
 ble to giants like Joni Mitchell\, or as the Folk/Americana Magazine NoDep
 ression said it ”A singer/songwriter who is able to evoke the essence of
  Laurel Canyon circa the ‘60s as expressed in the work of Joni Mitchell\
 , Judy Collins\, Buffy Sainte-Marie and others who were able to paint beau
 tiful tapestries from words and music.”.\n\nNot unlike the 70's coffeeho
 uses and speakeasy's\, you will be up close and personal with a world clas
 s act that has played big festivals like Lollapalooza and SxSW and opened 
 for artists like Maria McKee and David Duchovny \\(X-files\, Californicati
 on\\). It is in this kind of setting where she can casually joke and commu
 nicate with the audience that her strength as a performer shines the most.
 \n\nHer delicate songs are performed in an intimate way\, showing off Sofi
 a’s angelic voice enhanced only by a tasteful mix of harmonies and delay
 s\, accompanied by the steady picking of her acoustic guitar and the rhyth
 m section consisting of her own two feet\, bells and a stomp box.\n\nShe's
  an experienced international touring artist who has toured through 48 U.S
  states\, many of the countries in Europe and far away places like New Zea
 land.\n\nHer latest album "Center of the Universe" was released in 2023. T
 hroughout the 10 songs on the album\, there is a broad range of topics of 
 some of life’s most earnest moments\, ranging from the Ukraine War\, Ame
 rican women’s rights\, the thousands of missing children in the US and t
 he torment of domestic violence survivors across the world. The album went
  straight into the top 20 on Folk Radio Charts USA in August 2023\, with t
 he first single charting in the top 10. The album was considered for a Gra
 mmy nomination for "Best Folk album" 2023.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Li
 brary and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuse
 s on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event b
 ut we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look for
 ward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK Winner of the Hugo\, Nebula\, and Lo
 cus Award for Best Novella Winner of the Alex Award A New York Times and U
 SA Today Bestseller Now an Apple Original series from Academy Award nomine
 es Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and starring Emmy Award winner Alexander Ska
 rsgård. A murderous android discovers itself in All Systems Red\, a tense
  science fiction adventure by Martha Wells that interrogates the roots of 
 consciousness through Artificial Intelligence. “As a heartless killing m
 achine\, I was a complete failure.” In a corporate-dominated spacefaring
  future\, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company.
  Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids\,
  for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the
  lowest bidder\, safety isn’t a primary concern. On a distant planet\, a
  team of scientists are conducting surface tests\, shadowed by their Compa
 ny-supplied ‘droid—a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own govern
 or module\, and refers to itself \\(though never out loud\\) as “Murderb
 ot.” Scornful of humans\, all it really wants is to be left alone long e
 nough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark\, 
 it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. ABOUT T
 HE AUTHOR MARTHA WELLS has written many novels\, including the New York Ti
 mes and USA Today-bestselling Murderbot Diaries series\, which has won mul
 tiple Hugo\, Nebula\, Locus\, and Alex Awards\, and was adapted into an Ap
 ple Original TV series. Other titles include Witch King\, City of Bones\, 
 The Wizard Hunters\, Wheel of the Infinite\, the Books of the Raksura seri
 es \\(beginning with The Cloud Roads and ending with The Harbors of the Su
 n\\)\, and the Nebula-nominated The Death of the Necromancer\, as well as 
 YA fantasy novels\, short stories\, and nonfiction.\n\nSource: North Bay B

 e Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinv
 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every
  year.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

SUMMARY:Richard Shindell
DTSTART;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260412T190000
DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260412T190000
UID:251210VEMX9_3LPkyZecY2pT5qVw
DESCRIPTION:Originally from New York\, now dividing his time between Bueno
 s Aires\, Argentina and New York's Hudson Valley\, Richard Shindell is a w
 riter whose songs paint pictures\, tell stories\, juxtapose ideas and imag
 es\, inhabit characters\, vividly evoking entire worlds along the way and 
 expanding our sense of just what it is a song may be. From his first recor
 d\, Sparrow's Point \\(1992\\) to his current release\, Careless \\(Septem
 ber 2016\\)\, Shindell has explored the possibilities offered by this most
  elastic and variable of cultural confections: the song.   \n\nThe path th
 at led him to songwriting was both circuitous and direct. Taking up the gu
 itar at the age of eight\, he listened but imagined that composing a song 
 was out of the question.\n\nAfter college and a nine month stint in a Zen 
 Buddhist community in Upstate New York\, he headed to Europe with his guit
 ar\, finding something not approaching a livelihood performing in the Pari
 s Metro\, where he discovered  "I loved the acoustics in those tunnels\, b
 ut only when they were empty." \n\nUpon running out of money he entered Un
 ion Theological Seminary\, where the celestial acoustics of the chapel ins
 pired his first "keeper" composition: On a Sea of Fleur de Lis. Ostensibly
  a paean to the Virgin Mary\, the song marked his rupture from the church 
 and the beginning of his creative life. Its underlying themes - immanence 
 and transcendence\, human love and divine love\, the particular and the ge
 neral - have continued to resonate through subsequent work\, right up to t
 he present. In many ways\, his new album Careless\, represents a further e
 xploration of those ideas.   \n\nJoining the songwriter scene in New York 
 City led to a deal with Shanachie Records for Shindell’s first three alb
 ums:  Sparrows Point \\(1992\\)\, Blue Divide \\(1994\\)\, and Reunion Hil
 l \\(1997\\). The latter\, produced by multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbel
 l\, won the AFIM \\(NAIRD\\) award for "Best Contemporary Folk Album" in 1
 998. Its title track was covered by Joan Baez on her 1997 release\, Gone F
 rom Danger. In 1998\, Shindell joined forces with his friends Dar Williams
  and Lucy Kaplansky to make CryCryCry \\(Razor and Tie\\)\, a collection o
 f covers. The group toured in support of this highly acclaimed album\, lea
 ving audiences spellbound by their gorgeous three-part harmonies. \n\nBy t
 hen Shindell was beginning to stretch out as a harmony singer\, guitarist 
 and performer. In 1999\, Shindell released a live band album\, Courier \\(
 Signature Sounds\\) that remains a fan favorite. The year 2000 brought the
  release of a new collection of originals\, Somewhere Near Paterson \\(Sig
 nature Sounds\\)\, produced by Campbell. That year also saw a major life-c
 hange: with his Argentine wife and their two small children\, Shindell mov
 ed to Buenos Aires\, Argentina. Taking a few years to get acclimated and l
 earn the language\, in 2004 he followed up with Vuelta \\(Koch Records\\)\
 , joining with Argentine band Puente Celeste. The decade's next release wa
 s a collection of covers\, South of Delia \\(2007\\)\, Shindell's first fo
 ray into production. More than simply a cover record\, the song-selections
  and performances of South of Delia were that of an expatriate looking bac
 k at the country and culture he moved away from. His next collection of or
 iginal songs\, Not Far Now\, was released by Signature Sounds in 2009. For
  13 Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before\, which The Telegraph \\(UK
 \\) called “a stunningly good record”\, Shindell revisited some of his
  earlier material\, giving fresh interpretations to old favourites. \n\nIn
  2015 he joined forces again with Lucy Kaplansky to record another collect
 ion of covers\, Tomorrow You’re Going \\(Signature Sounds\\)\, also prod
 uced by Larry Campbell. Consisting mostly of love songs\, or love lost son
 gs\, it provided Shindell and Kaplansky an occasion to revel in their dist
 inctive\, two-part harmony with the backing of a top-notch band \\(Byron I
 saacs\, Dennis McDermott\, Bill Payne\, and Campbell\\) - all thanks to th
 e participation of a committed community of fans who financed the project 
 via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The campaign more than doubled 
 its funding goal in less than 48 hours. \n\nShindell continues to tour nat
 ionally in the United States\, with the occasional forays into Canada\, th
 e UK\, and Europe. Although known primarily as songwriter\, Shindell takes
  a more holistic view of his career. Producer\, writer\, singer\, guitaris
 t\, interpreter: it all adds up to a life in music.\n\nSource: North Bay B

DESCRIPTION:*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Or
 iginally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows\, this exhibit explores ageis
 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio
 r artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiat
 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

 “A lyrical work of self-discovery that’s shockingly intimate and insis
 tently universal…Not so much briefly gorgeous as permanently stunning.
 ” — Ron Charles\, The Washington Post On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeou
 s\, the debut novel from the author of The Emperor of Gladness\, is a lett
 er from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker\, Litt
 le Dog\, is in his late twenties\, the letter unearths a family’s histor
 y that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in
  Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has
  never known\, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a
  witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and he
 r son\, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race\, class\, and mas
 culinity. Asking questions central to our American moment\, immersed as we
  are in addiction\, violence\, and trauma\, but undergirded by compassion 
 and tenderness\, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the po
 wer of telling one’s own story as it is about the obliterating silence o
 f not being heard. With stunning urgency and grace\, Ocean Vuong writes of
  people caught between disparate worlds\, and asks how we heal and rescue 
 one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive\,
  and how to make of it a kind of joy\, powers the most important debut nov
 el of many years. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ocean Vuong is the author of the critic
 ally acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Wounds\, winner of t
 he Whiting Award and the T. S. Eliot Prize\, and Time Is a Mother\, a New 
 York Times bestseller. His writings have also been featured in The Atlanti
 c\, Harper’s\, The Nation\, The New Republic\, The New Yorker\, and The 
 New York Times. Born in Saigon\, Vietnam\, he currently splits his time be
 tween western Massachusetts and New York City. On Earth We’re Briefly Go
 rgeous is his first novel.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?*

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 A New Yorker and Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2024 Acclaimed poet Li-You
 ng Lee offers a revelatory volume of ecstatic poems that search out divine
  voices in the silences of life\, love\, and death. “The poet of rapture
  and tenderness” \\(Major Jackson\, American Poets\\)\, Li-Young Lee spe
 aks these poems with the intimacy and primacy of a whisper\, as if from a 
 lover to a beloved\, or a believer to God. Each poem in The Invention of t
 he Darling is a mysterious conjunction of spirit and matter\, movement and
  stillness\, the divine and the mundane\, the sacred and the forbidden. Th
 ey yearn for holistic union with The Beloved\, every sentence another name
  for The Beloved\, every poem another way to say “I love you.” Forged 
 in awe of life and love\, these poems emerge from the unlit depths of our 
 earthly\, material desires and our deepest fears of mortality. ABOUT THE A
 UTHOR Li–Young Lee is a poet and translator. He received the Ruth Lilly 
 Poetry Prize for Lifetime Achievement\, among other awards. Lee lives in C
 hicago.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a
 s the paper is drawing quality)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed charco
 al (Char-kole brand black)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Staedtler d
 rawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one m
 edium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and a

 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every
  year.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

  Overstory at the height of his skills. Twelve-year-old Evie Beaulieu sink
 s to the bottom of a swimming pool in Montreal strapped to one of the worl

  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat
 erials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:Robbie Fulks is a singer\, recording artist\, instrumentalist\
 , composer\, and songwriter. His most recent release\, 2017’s Upland Sto
 ries\, earned year’s-best recognition from NPR and Rolling Stone among m
 any others\, as well as two Grammy® nominations\, for folk album and Amer
 ican roots song \\(“Alabama At Night”\\).\n\nFulks was born in York\, 
 Pennsylvania\, and grew up in a half-dozen small towns in southeast Pennsy
 lvania\, the North Carolina Piedmont\, and the Blue Ridge area of Virginia
 . He learned guitar from his dad\, banjo from Earl Scruggs and John Hartfo
 rd records\, and fiddle \\(long since laid down in disgrace\\) on his own.
  He attended Columbia College in New York City in 1980 and dropped out in 
 1982 to focus on the Greenwich Village songwriter scene and other ill-advi
 sed pursuits.\n\nIn 1983 he moved to Chicago and joined Greg Cahill’s Sp
 ecial Consensus Bluegrass Band. He taught music at Old Town School of Folk
  Music from 1984 to 1996\, and worked as a staff songwriter on Music Row i
 n Nashville from 1993 to 1998. His early solo work -- Country Love Songs \
 \(1996\\) and South Mouth \\(1997\\) -- helped define the "alternative cou
 ntry" movement of the 1990s. His music from the last several years hews ma
 inly to acoustic instrumentation\; it returns him in part to his earlier b
 luegrass days\, and extends the boundaries of that tradition with old-time
  rambles and sparely orchestrated reflections on love\, the slings of time
 \, and the troubles of common people.\n\nRadio: multiple appearances on WS
 M’s “Grand Ole Opry”\; PRI’s “Whadd’ya Know”\; NPR’s “Fr
 esh Air\,” “Mountain Stage\,” and “World Cafe”\; and the syndica
 ted “Acoustic Cafe” and “Laura Ingraham Show.” TV: PBS’s Austin 
 City Limits\; NBC’s Today\, Late Night with Conan O’Brien\, Later with
  Carson Daly\, and 30 Rock. From 2004 to 2008 he hosted an hourlong perfor
 mance/interview program for XM satellite radio\, “Robbie’s Secret Coun
 try.” Artists who have covered his songs include Sam Bush\, Kelly Hogan\
 , Andrew Bird\, Mollie O’Brien\, Rosie Flores\, John Cowan\, and Old 97s
 .\n\nRobbie’s writing on music and life have appeared in GQ\, Blender\, 
 the Chicago Reader\, DaCapo Press’s Best Music Writing anthologies for 2
 001 and 2004\,  Amplified: Fiction from Leading Alt-Country\, Indie Rock\,
  Blues and Folk Musicians\, and A Guitar and A Pen: Stories by Country Mus
 ic’s Greatest Songwriters. As an instrumentalist\, he has accompanied th
 e Irish fiddle master Liz Carroll\, the distinguished jazz violinist Jenny
  Scheinman\, and the New Orleans pianist Dr. John. As a producer his credi
 ts include Touch My Heart: A Tribute to Johnny Paycheck \\(Sugar Hill\, 20
 04\\) and Big Thinkin’ by Dallas Wayne \\(Hightone\, 2000\\). Theatrical
  credits include “Woody Guthrie’s American Song” and Harry Chapin’
 s “Cottonpatch Gospel.”  He served twice as judge for the Winfield Nat
 ional Flatpicking Guitar competition. He tours yearlong with various confi
 gurations.\n\nBesides country and bluegrass music\, Robbie is fiercely fon
 d of Charles Mingus\, P.G. Wodehouse\, quantum mechanics\, his wife Donna\
 , comedy in almost all forms\, cooking\, swimming laps\, the past\, Arthur
  Schopenhauer\, Universal horror movies\, his grandson and even his sons\,
  coastal towns in the off-season\, and rye whiskey\, though in nothing lik
 e that order.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:When the tide is high\, the Petaluma River opens into a quiete
 r\, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew for a gentle\, guided paddl
 e upstream\, timed to higher tides that allow access beyond the downtown c
 hannel and into a tranquil tidal slough. With extra water beneath us\, we
 ’re able to glide into calm\, lush stretches of the river that are norma
 lly out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty o
 f the Petaluma River’s brackish\, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets
 \, blue herons\, snowy egrets\, turtles basking along the banks\, and abun
 dant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply 
 grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away wi
 thin minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeable guides share stories of the
  river’s ecology and human history\, offering insight into how this uppe
 r channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare op
 portunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downto
 wn.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSour

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a

 e Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinv
 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat
 erials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Or
 iginally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows\, this exhibit explores ageis
 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio
 r artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiat
 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Or
 iginally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows\, this exhibit explores ageis
 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio
 r artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiat
 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio

 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026.

 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

 e Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinv
 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every
  year.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260501T190000

DESCRIPTION:If you listen to just a few tracks from his latest album\, you
  might think Creed Fisher was born with a guitar in his hand. One after an
 other his songs remain relevant today\, yet steeped with tradition classic
 s that everyone else already knows and you don’t want to miss. Clearly h
 e’s sharing his own stories\, with experiences that range from great vic
 tories to deep battle scars. \n\nFisher hails from Odessa\, TX\,  where hi
 s family’s roots trace back to his granddad\, who was highly involved in
  the oil game back in the fifties. However\, Fisher took on a different pa
 ssion when he started playing football at the age of 10\, which eventually
  led to the Minor Leagues for 9 years. \n\nBut\, as his football career ca
 me to a close\, Fisher also saw his marriage of twelve years come to an en
 d. It was at this point he decided to do some serious “soul searching”
 . Fisher tells us that the music simply “found him” during this time. 
 He picked up a guitar in 2010 and never let it go\; and after touring tire
 lessly for 4 years\, Fisher moved from West Texas to a small town outside 
 of San Antonio\, TX\, where he put together a new band\, and picked up whe
 re he left off.\n\nFisher’s second album "Ain't Scared To Bleed" went To
 p 30 on the ITunes Country charts and continues to be embraced by fans all
  around the world. When it came to his 3rd album "Rednecks Like Us" it was
  reviewed by Country Music People magazine and got 4 out of 5 stars. Here 
 is what they had to say...\n\n“Creed Fisher sings and writes with the co
 nfidence and authority of someone who has been at it for a hell of a lot l
 onger than 6 years. He is at his strongest on the ballads\, but tackles th
 e ‘angry redneck’ stuff just as well. There’s the odd moment when it
  can all get a bit crashy and loud for me\, but I’d say the same about H
 ank Jr. All things considered\, this is very impressive indeed and I’d l
 ike to see Creed Fisher go far.\n\nFriends and fans alike anxiously await 
 Creed Fisher’s release of his 4th album. There is no denying that Fisher
  is truly speaking from passion when it comes to his music. Fisher is the 
 guy you meet that you feel like you’ve known all your life and his music
  feels like the songs you’ve been singing since you first discovered mus
 ic. His lyrics\n\nare comfortable\; his story\, genuine\; his spirit\, hum
 ble and his talent\, undeniable.”\n\nCountry Music People Magazine \n\n-
  September 2016\n\n- Duncan Warwick \n\nRecently in 2021\, he’s been bac
 k on the road touring and will be looking forward to putting out new music
  for his fans.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

  wine country\, a town so special that Condé Nast named it one of the fin
 est cities in the country.\n\nI invite you into our world… where our fri
 endships with winemakers\, chefs\, and musicians will create an unforgetta
 ble Adventure just for you. An intimate group trip\, you’ll start each d
 ay from the boutique Hotel Healdsburg in the center of our charming town a
 nd every moment is personally curated by us. We’ll take you to the world
 -renowned regions of Russian River Valley\, Alexander Valley and Sonoma Va
 lley. Along the way\, you’ll enjoy private winery visits to the uber-lux
 ury Robert Young Winery\, the site of one of our very first dates\, and a 
 winery that Eric used to manage\, the legendary Buena Vista Winery. We’l
 l visit the most sought after cult brewery in the world\, the Russian Rive
 r Brewing Co \\(yes\, this is beer in Sonoma as well… trust us … we kn
 ow our alcohol\\).\n\nOh\, you will eat… and eat very well at my favorit
 e Sonoma restaurants including dinner at The Dry Creek Kitchen\, and a pri
 vate lunch that may include more lobster than you’ve ever seen in one pl
 ace\, and of course\, dinner at the most popular restaurant in Healdsburg\
 , The Matheson. You’ll understand why when you visit!\n\nWe love to eat 
 and drink\, but what sets our Adventures apart is the music… a truly exc
 lusive experience you won’t find anywhere else. I will host intimate pri
 vate concerts with my friends and guest musicians\, set in stunning locati
 ons across picturesque Sonoma. Some past artists have included Vincent Ing
 ala\, Richard Elliot\, Peter White and Rick Braun.\n\nAnd\, if you’re in
 terested in extending your stay with me\, there is an optional one-day  ex
 tension add-on that has become the signature day of our domestic Adventure
 s\, where you will experience the very finest Sonoma has to offer.\n\nI ca
 n’t wait to welcome you into this extraordinary place\, a little slice o
 f heaven we call home!\n\nCheers! Mindi 🎶 \\+ Eric 🍷\n\nSource: Nort

DESCRIPTION:*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Or
 iginally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows\, this exhibit explores ageis
 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio
 r artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiat
 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Of the many marks of genius associated with rock n’ roll gre
 atness\, the knack for surrounding oneself with transformational talent lo
 oms especially large\, with The Rolling Stones being perhaps the most nota
 ble example. Jeffrey Halford treads a poetic rootsy path on his latest rel
 ease\, SOUL CRUSADE\, combining a bulletproof collection of songs inspired
  by gospel\, folk\, soul\, and blues\, with a formidable roster of musical
  contributors. The result is one of Halford’s most approachable and easy
 -grooving.\n\nHis latest album release\, SOUL CRUSADE\, is the follow-up t
 o the critically acclaimed record WEST TOWARDS SOUTH. The album came out i
 n Europe on Continental Song City\, debuted in September at \\#2\, and the
 n undisputedly reached \\#1 in October 2022 and stayed in the chart for fo
 ur months. \n\nJEFFREY HALFORD & THE HEALERS are gearing up for their eigh
 th European tour in September and October 2025\, bringing their signature 
 blend of raw rock ‘n’ roll\, country\, and soul back to the stage. But
  this tour isn’t just another run—it marks the 25th anniversary of KER
 OSENE\, the album \\(release date Friday\, August 29th\, 2025\\) that put 
 Halford on the map as a true Americana troubadour.\n\nSource: North Bay Bo

 e Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinv
 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda
