SUMMARY:Spike Sikes and His Awesome Hotcakes at The Elephant in the Room
DESCRIPTION:The most frequently heard comment after a Spike’s Awesome Hotcakes gig goes something like this –\n“No one is making this kind of music anymore!”\nBut what\, exactly\, is “this kind of music?”\nLike hotcakes themselves\, it goes by many names. Soul. Swing. Rhythm & Blues. Jazz. Jump. It’s a sound that’s classic and simple\, but when it’s done right\, it hits the spot\, and has you grinning from ear to ear. Spike has spent years searching for this sound.\nFrom the Texas blues joints he cut his teeth in to the funky halls of New Orleans\, he was always studying the music\, trying to find just the right recipe. It makes perfect sense that he found his bandmates in Sonoma County\, a music scene that has fostered many eclectic artists for decades.\nWhat he didn’t know was how hungry audiences were for “this kind of music.” You might say they’ve been eating it up like…Hotcakes!

SUMMARY:Jay Lewellen at the Penngrove Pub
DESCRIPTION:Spending his high school and procrastinated college years in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina\, bluegrass and mountain music found its way into Jay’s heart. Country rock was not only in the air\, it was the air. In the 1970’s there was plenty of blues rock everywhere that was like a bedrock foundation. \nAfter college\, Jay headed for San Francisco. Could there be a more radical cultural shift than the Blue Ridge mountains to San Francisco? Probably not in this country! Diving into the music scene of the Grateful Dead and California music festivals of all sorts\, his musical perspective was pretty much fully formed\, adding some touches of jazz and swing music in there somewhere.

DESCRIPTION:Emily — No Prisoner Be is a 24-part song cycle composed by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Kevin Puts for Grammy Award winning artists Joyce DiDonato and Time for Three.

Emily Dickinson’s poetry and Puts’ music feel as if they have always belonged together. With atmospheric lighting and strikingly simple staging designed by Andrew Staples\, the performance draws audiences into Dickinson’s inner world. Step into Emily— where every moment is both intimate and infinite.

SUMMARY:Joel Ross’ Good Vibes
DESCRIPTION:The jazz scene is in the midst of a spectacular vibes resurgence\, and the artist at the center of this 21st movement is Joel Ross. \nSince gaining renown a decade ago in with Chicago trumpeter Marquis Hill’s Blacktet he’s brought the instrument to the forefront of the contemporary scene\, with at least a dozen brilliant vibraphonists following in his wake. A gifted composer\, Ross had already appeared on more than a dozen albums as a sideman before releasing his 2019 debut as a leader on Blue Note\, KingMaker\, which earned the 2020 Jazz International Edison Award. With each subsequent album he’s grown as a composer and improviser\, like on his 2022 album-length suite The Parable of the Poet\, which finds his luxuriantly lyrical sensibility energized by his thick\, quick shifting harmonic orchestration. \nRoss’s Good Vibes combo features some of jazz’s most prodigious young players\, anchored by the charismatic bassist Kanoa Mendenhall\, and Tyler Bullock on piano\, Jeremy Dutton on drums\, and Devin Daniels playing alto saxophone. \nClosing the festival on a joyously ringing note\, Ross makes it clear that the vibraphone legacy of Milt Jackson\, Bobby Hutcherson and Steve Nelson is in expert hands.

SUMMARY:Valentine Embroidery at Sonoma Botanical Garden
DESCRIPTION:Embroidered Valentine Botanicals Workshop at Sonoma Botanical Garden invites guests to explore the Victorian-era tradition of floriography\, the language of flowers through a creative\, hands-on embroidery experience. Led by artist and maker Robert Mahar\, this workshop blends history\, design\, and needlework as participants learn core embroidery basics and essential stitches while embellishing a custom-printed 18×27” linen-cotton canvas featuring restored vintage floral illustrations associated with love and romance.    The artwork is sourced from an 1896 botanical volume and paired with charming typography\, creating a unique\, free-form sampler. Attendees will begin their projects in class and leave with the skills to finish at home\, resulting in a piece that can be displayed as wall art or used as a tea towel. . Includes Garden admission.

SUMMARY:YWCA Sonoma County Presents Love Letters
DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nYWCA Sonoma County Presents\nLove Letters\n\nFriday\, February 13\, 2026\n\n7:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \nCelebrating 50 years of service to the community\, the domestic violence service provider YWCA Sonoma County is presenting for one show only\, a fundraising performance of Love Letters\, the acclaimed play by A.R. Gurney. \nThe production will reprise the performances of Madeleine Keegan O’Connell\, CEO of YWCA Sonoma County\, as Melissa Gardner\, and former Press Democrat columnist Chris Smith as Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. The longtime Sonoma County friends first appeared in Love Letters in 2016. \nTicket sales for the play will raise much-needed funds for YWCA’s vital and singular domestic violence programs serving local families who find themselves in danger in their homes – the place we should all feel safest. For 50 years\, YWCA Sonoma County has been the county’s answer to the need by families for refuge\, advocacy\, and support with domestic violence. \nLove Letters is based on the lifelong\, intimate correspondence of these two characters whose entire story unfolds through written words exchanged in the form of letters. In a relationship spanning 50 years\, their letters contain their hopes and ambitions\, dreams and disappointments\, victories and defeats throughout their separate lives. \nAfter debuting in 1988\, Love Letters quickly moved to both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. Over the years\, the roles were performed by notable actors such as Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow\, Carol Burnett with Dennehy\, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen\, as well as Angelica Huston and Stacy Keach\, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. \nAccording to Madeleine Keegan O’Connell\, “In addition to the basic needs of food\, clothing and shelter\, people deserve respect\, dignity and safety to conduct productive lives and care for their children. YWCA is honored to be a leader in the efforts to address needs so many people take for granted.”  \nChris Smith\, who retired from the PD in 2021 but still contributes to the newspaper on occasion\, said\, “Bringing the power of the written word and the lost art of letter writing together with support for YWCA Sonoma County is a winning combination for me.” \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa.

DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nLive Nation Presents \nRalph Barbosa: The Red 40 Tour\n\nSunday\, March 15\, 2026\n\n7:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS\nAGE RESTRICTION: 18 and above \n \nOne of the shyest attention hogs ever to do comedy\, Ralph Barbosa’s disarming and laid-back style has made him a stand-out on stage\, on TV\, and as host of the Formula Bean YouTube channel with Luis Cisneros. Last summer\, Barbosa premiered his second hour-long stand-up special\, Ralph Barbosa: Planet Bosa\, as part of Hulu’s new Hularious comedy brand. \nHis first hour-long stand-up special\, Ralph Barbosa: Cowabunga\, premiered on Netflix on October 31\, 2023\, and ranked as the #3 TV show on Netflix throughout its first week on the service. \nIn July 2024\, Barbosa was selected as one of Variety’s 10 Comics to Watch for 2024 and toured theaters throughout North America\, including two sold-out theater shows as part of the Netflix Is A Joke Fest 2024\, as well as hosting the kick-off show. 2023 was Barbosa’s break-out year\, during which he was a guest on The Joe Rogan Experience\, made his debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\, and performed Comedy Central Stand-up Featuring: Ralph Barbosa\, which topped 6 million views on YouTube. \nBarbosa also starred in the HBO Max comedy special\, Entre Nos: The Winners 3 in 2022\, and earlier that year his Don’t Tell Comedy performance was released on YouTube and now has over 6 million views. \n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.

SUMMARY:Emmylou Harris
DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nEmmylou Harris\n\nFriday\, April 17\, 2026\n\n8:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \nBillboard Century Award recipient\, Harris’ contribution as a singer and songwriter spans 40 years. She has recorded more than 25 albums and has lent her talents to countless fellow artists’ recordings. In recognition of her remarkable career\, Harris was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. \nHarris is one of the most admired and influential women in music. She has recorded with such diverse artists as Linda Ronstadt\, Daniel Lanois\, Bob Dylan\, Mark Knopfler\, Neil Young\, Gram Parsons\, Willie Nelson\, Dolly Parton\, Roy Orbison\, Ryan Adams\, Beck\, Elvis Costello\, Johnny Cash\, Lucinda Williams\, Lyle Lovett and Rodney Crowell. Few artists have achieved such honesty or have revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career\, Harris continues to share the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older\, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa.
