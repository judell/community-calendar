DESCRIPTION:What if Mozart’s music could surprise you with new colors yo
 u didn’t know you were missing? This program shines a spotlight on two o
 f his favorite voices: the basset horn and the basset clarinet. Deeper\, w
 armer\, and more velvety than their modern descendants\, these instruments
  were prized in Mozart’s time for their ability to sing\, sigh\, and whi
 sper with uncanny intimacy.\n\nThe program begins with a charming quintet 
 by Mozart’s contemporary Johann Backofen\, whose writing shows off the b
 asset horn’s mellow glow and conversational wit. Mozart’s youthful “
 Milanese” string quartet follows\, sparkling with elegance and invention
 . The program culminates in Mozart’s beloved clarinet quintet\, a work o
 f timeless beauty\, virtuosity\, and ingenuity performed here on a replica
  of the original basset clarinet Mozart had in mind. Performed on period i
 nstruments\, this concert offers a chance to hear familiar music scrubbed 
 clean—lighter\, more transparent\, and irresistibly alive.\n\nSource: Pr

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w

  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\

DESCRIPTION:Robbie Fulks is a singer\, recording artist\, instrumentalist\
 , composer\, and songwriter. His most recent release\, 2017’s Upland Sto
 ries\, earned year’s-best recognition from NPR and Rolling Stone among m
 any others\, as well as two Grammy® nominations\, for folk album and Amer
 ican roots song \\(“Alabama At Night”\\).\n\nFulks was born in York\, 
 Pennsylvania\, and grew up in a half-dozen small towns in southeast Pennsy
 lvania\, the North Carolina Piedmont\, and the Blue Ridge area of Virginia
 . He learned guitar from his dad\, banjo from Earl Scruggs and John Hartfo
 rd records\, and fiddle \\(long since laid down in disgrace\\) on his own.
  He attended Columbia College in New York City in 1980 and dropped out in 
 1982 to focus on the Greenwich Village songwriter scene and other ill-advi
 sed pursuits.\n\nIn 1983 he moved to Chicago and joined Greg Cahill’s Sp
 ecial Consensus Bluegrass Band. He taught music at Old Town School of Folk
  Music from 1984 to 1996\, and worked as a staff songwriter on Music Row i
 n Nashville from 1993 to 1998. His early solo work -- Country Love Songs \
 \(1996\\) and South Mouth \\(1997\\) -- helped define the "alternative cou
 ntry" movement of the 1990s. His music from the last several years hews ma
 inly to acoustic instrumentation\; it returns him in part to his earlier b
 luegrass days\, and extends the boundaries of that tradition with old-time
  rambles and sparely orchestrated reflections on love\, the slings of time
 \, and the troubles of common people.\n\nRadio: multiple appearances on WS
 M’s “Grand Ole Opry”\; PRI’s “Whadd’ya Know”\; NPR’s “Fr
 esh Air\,” “Mountain Stage\,” and “World Cafe”\; and the syndica
 ted “Acoustic Cafe” and “Laura Ingraham Show.” TV: PBS’s Austin 
 City Limits\; NBC’s Today\, Late Night with Conan O’Brien\, Later with
  Carson Daly\, and 30 Rock. From 2004 to 2008 he hosted an hourlong perfor
 mance/interview program for XM satellite radio\, “Robbie’s Secret Coun
 try.” Artists who have covered his songs include Sam Bush\, Kelly Hogan\
 , Andrew Bird\, Mollie O’Brien\, Rosie Flores\, John Cowan\, and Old 97s
 .\n\nRobbie’s writing on music and life have appeared in GQ\, Blender\, 
 the Chicago Reader\, DaCapo Press’s Best Music Writing anthologies for 2
 001 and 2004\,  Amplified: Fiction from Leading Alt-Country\, Indie Rock\,
  Blues and Folk Musicians\, and A Guitar and A Pen: Stories by Country Mus
 ic’s Greatest Songwriters. As an instrumentalist\, he has accompanied th
 e Irish fiddle master Liz Carroll\, the distinguished jazz violinist Jenny
  Scheinman\, and the New Orleans pianist Dr. John. As a producer his credi
 ts include Touch My Heart: A Tribute to Johnny Paycheck \\(Sugar Hill\, 20
 04\\) and Big Thinkin’ by Dallas Wayne \\(Hightone\, 2000\\). Theatrical

 s “Cottonpatch Gospel.”  He served twice as judge for the Winfield Nat
 ional Flatpicking Guitar competition. He tours yearlong with various confi
 gurations.\n\nBesides country and bluegrass music\, Robbie is fiercely fon

DTEND;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260413T020000Z
UID:251210VEMX9_3LPkyZecY2pT5qVw
DESCRIPTION:Originally from New York\, now dividing his time between Bueno
 s Aires\, Argentina and New York's Hudson Valley\, Richard Shindell is a w
 riter whose songs paint pictures\, tell stories\, juxtapose ideas and imag
 es\, inhabit characters\, vividly evoking entire worlds along the way and 
 expanding our sense of just what it is a song may be. From his first recor
 d\, Sparrow's Point \\(1992\\) to his current release\, Careless \\(Septem
 ber 2016\\)\, Shindell has explored the possibilities offered by this most
  elastic and variable of cultural confections: the song.   \n\nThe path th
 at led him to songwriting was both circuitous and direct. Taking up the gu
 itar at the age of eight\, he listened but imagined that composing a song 
 was out of the question.\n\nAfter college and a nine month stint in a Zen 
 Buddhist community in Upstate New York\, he headed to Europe with his guit
 ar\, finding something not approaching a livelihood performing in the Pari
 s Metro\, where he discovered  "I loved the acoustics in those tunnels\, b
 ut only when they were empty." \n\nUpon running out of money he entered Un
 ion Theological Seminary\, where the celestial acoustics of the chapel ins
 pired his first "keeper" composition: On a Sea of Fleur de Lis. Ostensibly
  a paean to the Virgin Mary\, the song marked his rupture from the church 
 and the beginning of his creative life. Its underlying themes - immanence 
 and transcendence\, human love and divine love\, the particular and the ge
 neral - have continued to resonate through subsequent work\, right up to t
 he present. In many ways\, his new album Careless\, represents a further e
 xploration of those ideas.   \n\nJoining the songwriter scene in New York 
 City led to a deal with Shanachie Records for Shindell’s first three alb
 ums:  Sparrows Point \\(1992\\)\, Blue Divide \\(1994\\)\, and Reunion Hil
 l \\(1997\\). The latter\, produced by multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbel
 l\, won the AFIM \\(NAIRD\\) award for "Best Contemporary Folk Album" in 1
 998. Its title track was covered by Joan Baez on her 1997 release\, Gone F
 rom Danger. In 1998\, Shindell joined forces with his friends Dar Williams
  and Lucy Kaplansky to make CryCryCry \\(Razor and Tie\\)\, a collection o
 f covers. The group toured in support of this highly acclaimed album\, lea
 ving audiences spellbound by their gorgeous three-part harmonies. \n\nBy t
 hen Shindell was beginning to stretch out as a harmony singer\, guitarist 
 and performer. In 1999\, Shindell released a live band album\, Courier \\(
 Signature Sounds\\) that remains a fan favorite. The year 2000 brought the
  release of a new collection of originals\, Somewhere Near Paterson \\(Sig
 nature Sounds\\)\, produced by Campbell. That year also saw a major life-c
 hange: with his Argentine wife and their two small children\, Shindell mov
 ed to Buenos Aires\, Argentina. Taking a few years to get acclimated and l
 earn the language\, in 2004 he followed up with Vuelta \\(Koch Records\\)\
 , joining with Argentine band Puente Celeste. The decade's next release wa
 s a collection of covers\, South of Delia \\(2007\\)\, Shindell's first fo
 ray into production. More than simply a cover record\, the song-selections
  and performances of South of Delia were that of an expatriate looking bac
 k at the country and culture he moved away from. His next collection of or
 iginal songs\, Not Far Now\, was released by Signature Sounds in 2009. For
  13 Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before\, which The Telegraph \\(UK
 \\) called “a stunningly good record”\, Shindell revisited some of his
  earlier material\, giving fresh interpretations to old favourites. \n\nIn
  2015 he joined forces again with Lucy Kaplansky to record another collect
 ion of covers\, Tomorrow You’re Going \\(Signature Sounds\\)\, also prod
 uced by Larry Campbell. Consisting mostly of love songs\, or love lost son
 gs\, it provided Shindell and Kaplansky an occasion to revel in their dist
 inctive\, two-part harmony with the backing of a top-notch band \\(Byron I
 saacs\, Dennis McDermott\, Bill Payne\, and Campbell\\) - all thanks to th
 e participation of a committed community of fans who financed the project 
 via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The campaign more than doubled 
 its funding goal in less than 48 hours. \n\nShindell continues to tour nat
 ionally in the United States\, with the occasional forays into Canada\, th
 e UK\, and Europe. Although known primarily as songwriter\, Shindell takes
  a more holistic view of his career. Producer\, writer\, singer\, guitaris
 t\, interpreter: it all adds up to a life in music.\n\nSource: Press Democ

DESCRIPTION:Revolutionizing the Film Festival Experience\n\nThe Sebastopol
  Documentary Film Festival is the San Francisco Bay Area's premier documen
 tary film festival\, offering four days of curated films\, award presentat
 ions\, cinephile panels and forums\, upscale gatherings\, VIP receptions\,
  and casual meet-and-greets-all in the heart of Sonoma County.\n\nFrom its
  roots as a local fest showing about 40 films in 2007\, SDFF now receives 
 more than 700 submissions from 62\\+ countries per year. In 2025\, 57 film
 s were programmed and shown and the event was attended by filmmakers\, as 
 well as a robust audience of film lovers. In addition to its commitment to
  honoring diversity in all its forms by providing open calls for entry\, S
 DFF is an Oscar®-qualifying film festival for short and mini form documen
 taries.\n\nSDFF is proudly progressive in its curation of topics and forms
 . Now more than ever\, festival organizers seek to amplify urgent messages
 \, uplift stories from marginalized communities\, and support earnest effo
 rts to provoke political change\, effect social justice\, and encourage pe
 rsonal growth\n\nFor more information about how you can submit your film\,
  volunteer to help with the fest\, donate money\, or promote our vital wor
 k\, please visit https://www.sebastopolfilm.org/.\n\nAbout SDFF \\(Sebasto
 pol Documentary Film Festival\\):\n\nFounded in 2007\, the first ever Seba
 stopol Documentary Film Festival \\(SDFF\\) boldly curated 44 films that b
 rought into focus a wealth of talented filmmakers from Sonoma County and t
 he greater San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSixteen years later\, nearly 700 tit
 les from 62 countries were openly submitted for SDFF 2023. Sixty-three fil
 ms were programmed\, the event was attended by 93 filmmakers and an impres
 sive audience\, through in-person and streaming delivery.\n\nSDFF honors d
 iversity in all forms. We continue to provide equal opportunity for filmma
 kers through open calls for entry\; explore what it's like for any life to
  wake to its existence.\n\nSDFF is an Oscar® qualifying Film Festival for
  documentaries in the short form. Sebastopol Documentary Film Festival is 
 proudly progressive\, often featuring spotlights on social justice\, journ
 alism\, current issues. When the right films come through we've programmed
  different POV's of the same story. Given the proliferation of AI\, docume
 ntaries might become our only touchstone for what was 'real' at a moment i
 n time. What better platform than a non-fiction film festival to encourage
  fresh and critical thinking?\n\nDate and Time: Thursday\, 09 April 2026 a
 t 09:00 - Sunday\, 12 April 2026 at 17:00\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 more than 700 submissions from 62\\+ countries per year. In 2025\, 57 film
 s were programmed and shown and the event was attended by filmmakers\, as 
 well as a robust audience of film lovers. In addition to its commitment to
  honoring diversity in all its forms by providing open calls for entry\, S
 DFF is an Oscar®-qualifying film festival for short and mini form documen
 taries.\n\nSDFF is proudly progressive in its curation of topics and forms
 . Now more than ever\, festival organizers seek to amplify urgent messages
 \, uplift stories from marginalized communities\, and support earnest effo
 rts to provoke political change\, effect social justice\, and encourage pe
 rsonal growth\n\nFor more information about how you can submit your film\,

 pol Documentary Film Festival\\):\n\nFounded in 2007\, the first ever Seba
 stopol Documentary Film Festival \\(SDFF\\) boldly curated 44 films that b
 rought into focus a wealth of talented filmmakers from Sonoma County and t
 he greater San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSixteen years later\, nearly 700 tit
 les from 62 countries were openly submitted for SDFF 2023. Sixty-three fil
 ms were programmed\, the event was attended by 93 filmmakers and an impres
 sive audience\, through in-person and streaming delivery.\n\nSDFF honors d

  wake to its existence.\n\nSDFF is an Oscar® qualifying Film Festival for
  documentaries in the short form. Sebastopol Documentary Film Festival is 
 proudly progressive\, often featuring spotlights on social justice\, journ
 alism\, current issues. When the right films come through we've programmed
  different POV's of the same story. Given the proliferation of AI\, docume
 ntaries might become our only touchstone for what was 'real' at a moment i
 n time. What better platform than a non-fiction film festival to encourage
  fresh and critical thinking?\n\nDate and Time: Thursday\, 09 April 2026 a

DESCRIPTION:Revolutionizing the Film Festival Experience\n\nThe Sebastopol
  Documentary Film Festival is the San Francisco Bay Area's premier documen
 tary film festival\, offering four days of curated films\, award presentat
 ions\, cinephile panels and forums\, upscale gatherings\, VIP receptions\,
  and casual meet-and-greets-all in the heart of Sonoma County.\n\nFrom its
  roots as a local fest showing about 40 films in 2007\, SDFF now receives 
 more than 700 submissions from 62\\+ countries per year. In 2025\, 57 film
 s were programmed and shown and the event was attended by filmmakers\, as 
 well as a robust audience of film lovers. In addition to its commitment to
  honoring diversity in all its forms by providing open calls for entry\, S
 DFF is an Oscar®-qualifying film festival for short and mini form documen
 taries.\n\nSDFF is proudly progressive in its curation of topics and forms
 . Now more than ever\, festival organizers seek to amplify urgent messages
 \, uplift stories from marginalized communities\, and support earnest effo
 rts to provoke political change\, effect social justice\, and encourage pe
 rsonal growth\n\nFor more information about how you can submit your film\,
  volunteer to help with the fest\, donate money\, or promote our vital wor
 k\, please visit https://www.sebastopolfilm.org/.\n\nAbout SDFF \\(Sebasto
 pol Documentary Film Festival\\):\n\nFounded in 2007\, the first ever Seba
 stopol Documentary Film Festival \\(SDFF\\) boldly curated 44 films that b
 rought into focus a wealth of talented filmmakers from Sonoma County and t
 he greater San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSixteen years later\, nearly 700 tit
 les from 62 countries were openly submitted for SDFF 2023. Sixty-three fil
 ms were programmed\, the event was attended by 93 filmmakers and an impres
 sive audience\, through in-person and streaming delivery.\n\nSDFF honors d
 iversity in all forms. We continue to provide equal opportunity for filmma
 kers through open calls for entry\; explore what it's like for any life to
  wake to its existence.\n\nSDFF is an Oscar® qualifying Film Festival for
  documentaries in the short form. Sebastopol Documentary Film Festival is 
 proudly progressive\, often featuring spotlights on social justice\, journ
 alism\, current issues. When the right films come through we've programmed
  different POV's of the same story. Given the proliferation of AI\, docume
 ntaries might become our only touchstone for what was 'real' at a moment i
 n time. What better platform than a non-fiction film festival to encourage
  fresh and critical thinking?\n\nDate and Time: Thursday\, 09 April 2026 a

DESCRIPTION:If you like the sound of Laura Marling\, Lucinda Williams\, Gi
 llian Welch\, Emmylou Harris... then this is a concert for your taste.\n\n
 Sofia Talvik is a rare artist and an avid storyteller with a voice compara
 ble to giants like Joni Mitchell\, or as the Folk/Americana Magazine NoDep
 ression said it ”A singer/songwriter who is able to evoke the essence of
  Laurel Canyon circa the ‘60s as expressed in the work of Joni Mitchell\
 , Judy Collins\, Buffy Sainte-Marie and others who were able to paint beau
 tiful tapestries from words and music.”.\n\nNot unlike the 70's coffeeho
 uses and speakeasy's\, you will be up close and personal with a world clas
 s act that has played big festivals like Lollapalooza and SxSW and opened 
 for artists like Maria McKee and David Duchovny \\(X-files\, Californicati
 on\\). It is in this kind of setting where she can casually joke and commu
 nicate with the audience that her strength as a performer shines the most.
 \n\nHer delicate songs are performed in an intimate way\, showing off Sofi
 a’s angelic voice enhanced only by a tasteful mix of harmonies and delay
 s\, accompanied by the steady picking of her acoustic guitar and the rhyth
 m section consisting of her own two feet\, bells and a stomp box.\n\nShe's
  an experienced international touring artist who has toured through 48 U.S
  states\, many of the countries in Europe and far away places like New Zea
 land.\n\nHer latest album "Center of the Universe" was released in 2023. T
 hroughout the 10 songs on the album\, there is a broad range of topics of 
 some of life’s most earnest moments\, ranging from the Ukraine War\, Ame
 rican women’s rights\, the thousands of missing children in the US and t
 he torment of domestic violence survivors across the world. The album went
  straight into the top 20 on Folk Radio Charts USA in August 2023\, with t
 he first single charting in the top 10. The album was considered for a Gra
 mmy nomination for "Best Folk album" 2023.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DTEND;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260408T020000Z
UID:251222qDbjR_wsQkagQmDbLz7wsA
DESCRIPTION:Maybe a minute passed before I knew I’d be singing “Karaok
 e” for the rest of my life. The second song on Heartmind\, the tenth alb
 um by Cass McCombs\, “Karaoke” is a god-level burst of power-pop perfe
 ction\, as fetching as anything Cass has ever cut. The springy staccato gu
 itar\, the vaporized electric keys\, the melody seemingly born for singing
  or clapping or dancing along: Cass triangulates a perch of his very own o
 ut among The Go-Betweens\, The dB’s\, and The Cure\, and vibrates there\
 , a beacon. And then\, of course\, there is the song’s playful if painfu
 l lyrical conceit—the lover who is making all the sacred motions of comm
 itment but whose feelings may be no more deep or real than someone simply 
 reading the lyrics for “Vision of Love” or “Stand by Your Man” fro
 m some crowded bar’s TV screen.  \n\n \n\nSo after harmonizing alone wit
 h “Karaoke” for the twentieth time during a solo cross-country drive\,
  I had to ask Cass for myself how it all went down: Was this heartbreak\, 
 or was it legit love? He paused\, thought\, then laughed. “Well\, that
 ’s the question\,” he said slowly. “Neither?” Or maybe\, he finall
 y averred\, both? That is—to me\, anyway—the true joy of Heartmind\, a
 n eight-song album that feels more like a journey among assorted tuneful f
 eelings\, somehow shaped to meet whatever it is a particular listener need
 s\, to mirror whatever they bring to these uniformly incandescent and trag
 icomic tracks. Cass has set the stage\, but you get to pick the heroes and
  villains\, the winners and losers\, the jokes and the drags. He doesn’t
  want to give you the questions\, let alone the answers.  \n\n \n\nTo wit:
  Did the soldier at the center of the aching country epic “Unproud Warri
 or” abdicate responsibility or finally claim it? As the percussion shuff
 les and horns sigh beneath “Krakatau\,” will you agree that you can be
  cleansed without being killed—or be anything better than you already ar
 e while still remaining yourself? Do you identify with being enraptured by
  music for so long that it ultimately drained you\, too\, as Cass suggests
  \\(maybe?\\) during the wiry opener\, “Music Is Blue”? These are just
  a few of the questions that come to mind when I hear Heartmind\, but I do
 n’t even know if they’re the right questions. Still\, I can now sing a
 long to every word. \n\n \n\nThere are\, at least\, some basic facts to sh
 are about Heartmind\, logistical evidence that may in turn shape your own 
 questions: Cass recorded these songs in multiple sessions on both coasts\,
  in Brooklyn and Burbank. The great Shahzad Ismaily not only cut the stagg
 ering “Unproud Warrior” and four others here but also played lots of b
 ass. Buddy Ross tracked “New Earth\,” a paean of post-humanity renewal
  with several sharp wisecracks. Ariel Rechtshaid—now a dozen years into 
 his collaboration with Cass\, which began with 2009’s Catacombs—captur
 ed Cass’ scintillating guitars on “Belong to Heaven\,” a thoughtful 
 consideration of what we all lose when we lose an old friend to the inevit
 able end. The steadfast Rob Schnapf \\(who previously produced McCombs’ 
 ANTI- debut\, Mangy Love\\) mixed and merged it all.  \n\n \n\nWynonna Jud
 d \\(yes\, that one\\) offers harmonies\, while her beau Cactus Moser prov
 ides some lap steel. Joe Russo\, Kassa Overall\, Danielle Haim\, Nestor Go
 mez: I don’t actually need to tell you how good everyone who pitches in 
 here is\, because you’ll be able to hear it for yourself the moment you 
 listen. \n\n \n\nSpeaking of hearing it for yourself\, here’s how I hear
  at least some of these songs: “Unproud Warrior\,” featuring the afore
 mentioned Wynonna\, is a necessary anthem for these times\, where we all s
 eem to have opinions about the critical news of the day without ever quite
  knowing what to do about it. Invoking Stephen Crane\, S.E. Hinton\, and f
 ast-food restaurants\, it is an allegory about our perception and ownershi
 p of responsibility\, set to an elegant C&W ache. “New Earth” celebrat
 es the renewal that’s possible when humanity’s finally done with its b
 ullshit\, when all our temporary madness self-destructs long enough to let
  nature reset itself. Sorry\, but you’ll be humming along to predictions
  of your own destruction here. And using much of the same band of rootsy w
 eirdos as “Unproud Warrior\,” “Blue Blue Band” unfurls as a sequel
  to Gillian Welch’s Ruination Day suite\, where the offering up of onese
 lf for entertainment always entails at least a sliver of self-destruction.
  Also\, Cass sings that the bassist\, Fritz\, “cooks it hotter than grit
 s\,” which is about all any Southerner needs to hear in order to love an
 y song. \n\n \n\nAt the risk of being didactic\, I need to reiterate somet
 hing here: Aside from the credits\, I might be wrong about everything I’
 ve said about these songs. Again\, sorry. Where I hear dark humor\, you mi
 ght hear relentless pain\; where I hear winning cynicism\, you might hear 
 harrowing nihilism. And that is\, in some way\, the point for Cass—to wr
 ite songs that speak of his moment\, and then let everyone else decide how
  or even if they speak to their moment. These are honest offerings for abs
 urdist times\, funny confessions of frailty amid circumstances that often 
 seem too tense for even the humble chuckle. On Heartmind\, Cass McCombs en
 ters the double-digit-album phase of his career\, a quantitatively rarifie
 d place for any songwriter\; rarer still\, though\, is the fact that he do
 es not yet seem to have settled into a qualitative sound or pattern\, of s
 inging the same thought twice \\(or perhaps even once\\).  \n\n \n\nOne mo
 re thing I can say for certain\, then? For Cass\, this has never been kara
 oke. —Grayson Haver Currin\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:You can’t water old flowers. Yes\, you fall in love\, you ma
 ke mistakes\, and so do they. You run through blackberry fields in the sum
 mer of your youth\, dream in passenger seats gazing past towns and fields\
 , imagining a future life where everything works out. I fell head over hee
 ls in love at nineteen. The kind of love where you call up your best frien
 d and say\, “I think I’ve found my soulmate.” The pull towards that 
 first true love is strong. It consumes you\, makes you question your own d
 reams. \n\nWe taught each other\, grew up together\, we were family. We fi
 t just right\, for a time. Then one day\, after a long and rocky nine year
  road\, life changed and became a complicated mess too hard to untangle. W
 e couldn’t get our love back\, no matter how many dreams that shadowed t
 his hard truth. We grew resentful\, selfish\, harboring past mistakes and 
 holding them up like armor from every blow. We grew up and our paths diver
 ted. \n\nOn New Year’s Day\, 2018\, a great horned owl dropped dead at m
 y exes’ feet in my mother’s yard. It felt like a daunting omen\, usher
 ing on change for the both of us. We were distraught. We couldn’t afford
  the taxidermy\, so we placed it in a big blue plastic garbage bin. Now it
  felt so cheap\, that mystic creature in a plastic coffin. That’s how lo
 ve feels sometimes – like we don’t serve it the ending it deserves. \n
 \nThe omen was true. That year\, I started to see the woman I could be\, t
 he woman I wasn’t yet. Anytime I felt like myself\, I was alone and wand
 ering\, and I knew that was a sign that it was time for change. New Year
 ’s Day 2019\, I said goodbye to my first true love and moved across the 
 country. Losing someone you spend every day for nearly a decade with is in
 tense. We talked in our dreams. I knew where he was\, even before I entere
 d a place. He’d always be there if I had a feeling. Humans are connected
  in unexplainable ways. \n\nI was writing a lot after we broke up as a hea
 ling technique\, preserving each memory like an emotional archaeologist. L
 ate one night\, I woke up from a dream where I was searching for him\, my 
 ex\, at a carnival. It was so vivid. I woke myself up to write a song on m
 y piano. The next morning\, he reached out to me for the first time in mon
 ths. We went out\, had a drink\, caught up\, and he told me that the harde
 st part about our separation was a reoccurring nightmare where he searched
  for me at a carnival. In that moment\, I knew\, humans have ways of conne
 cting beyond words and touch. I truly believe that. We had the same dream\
 , without seeing each other for months. \n\nEven with all the mystic symbo
 lism that year presented\, this is an age-old story I can’t make up. We 
 fall in love\, we grow up\, we change\, and they don’t change with us. 
 ‘Old Flowers’ is about heartbreak. There are a million records and son
 gs about that\, but I did not lie when writing these songs. This album is 
 about loving and caring for the person you know you can’t be with. It’
 s about being afraid to be vulnerable after you’ve been hurt. It’s abo
 ut a woman who is alone\, but okay with that\, if it means truth. \n\nThis
  was my truth this year – my nine year relationship ended\, and I’m a 
 woman alone in the world\, but happy to know herself.  \n\nThese songs cam
 e to me alone\, late nights in Bisbee\, Lisbon\, Nashville\, and London. S
 ometimes I’d just cry and sing\, and a song would come out. I drank too 
 much wine while writing this record\, lit too many candles. You could say 
 this was my attempt to summon the muse\, but that’s bullshit\, because s
 he was just standing there naked looking me in the eyes. So I told her the
  truth. \n\nThis is my story of the most heartbreaking\, but soul-revealin
 g\, year of my life. I drove myself mad. I drove to the smoky mountains ju
 st to drive back. I danced with a Portuguese boxer and cried on his should
 er in a Fado cafe. I did everything an artist is “supposed to do.” But
  at the end of the day\, beyond all the romance\, these songs are my truth
 . I think they might be yours too.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Against the backdrop of over 25 years of creative collaboratio
 n\, Ben Allison\, Steve Cardenas\, and Ted Nash weave musical conversation
 s that are full of subtlety and surprise. They take turns arranging for th
 e trio\, which has released four albums. For this concert\, they will be p
 laying a selection of music from each of their recordings: Quiet Revolutio
 n: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre and Jim Hall\, Somewhere Else:
  which features our arrangements of songs from Leonard Bernstein’s West 
 Side Story\, Quiet Revolution: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre an
 d Jim Hall\, Healing Power: which features music by the iconic composer/ar
 ranger Carla Bley and Tell the Birds I Said Hello: which features previous
 ly unrecorded gems by the genius pianist/composer Herbie Nichols. To date\
 , their albums have been streamed millions of times\, and they have perfor
 med at countless festivals throughout Europe\, the US\, and South America.
  The group is modeled after reedist/composer Jimmy Giuffre’s drummerless
  trios of the 1950s and 60s. As jazz was becoming more expressionistic and
  at times bombastic\, musicians like Giuffre were going in the opposite di
 rection. They were envisioning quieter music that maintained elements of b
 lues and folk while also embracing the emerging qualities of free playing.
  Ben\, Steve and Ted create music that is intimate and highly conversation
 al in tone—a ‘musical trialogue\,’ where group interplay is the focu
 s.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:John Doe was born in 1977 when he arrived in Los Angeles. His 
 previous life in Tennessee\, Wisconsin & Baltimore was a great & fertile t
 ime but new music and social changes led him to events that created a life
  in art. He graduated from Antioch College in Baltimore in 1975\, worked a
 s a roofer\, aluminum siding mechanic\, and ran a poetry reading series. M
 s. Meyers was his landlord in the rural black community of Simpsonville \,
  MD.\n\nJohn met Exene Cervenka at the Venice poetry workshop Nov 1976 and
  he started working with Billy Zoom around the same time. When DJ Bonebrak
 e joined X in mid-1977 the line up was complete. They released six studio 
 records\, five or six singles and one live record from 1978-1993. Five of 
 X’s records have been re-issued along with two compilations. The Unheard
  Music documents their lives and progress as a band from 1980-83. In 2009 
 the film was included in the Sundance UCLA Archive of greatest films of al
 l time. They appeared several times on American Bandstand\, Solid Gold and
  David Letterman. As one of the last original punk rock bands standing\, t
 hey continue to tour. The day that X played a free noontime concert in Ful
 lerton\, CA\, they caused Orange County’s greatest high school truancy r
 ate to date.\n\nIn 1988 John started a family and lived in the Tehachapi M
 ountains\, near the “Grapevine” of Highway 5\, which separates souther
 n and central California. He has recorded 8 solo records w/ numerous renow
 ned singers and players\, more recently including Patty Griffin\, Dan Auer
 bach\, Aimee Mann\, Don Was\, Kathleen Edwards and Greg Liesz. He has appe
 ared in over 50 films and television productions\, with some of his most n
 otable roles in Road House\, Georgia\, Roadside Prophets\, Great Balls of 
 Fire\, Pure Country and Roswell. He continues to act these days but more s
 poradically as his touring schedule has become more demanding.\n\nOther mu
 sical side projects include work with the Knitters\, Jill Sobule and The S
 adies. He continues to write poetry and has even taught workshops from tim
 e to time. He currently lives in Austin\, TX.\n\nSource: Press Democrat
