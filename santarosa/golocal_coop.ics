Think winter-morning-on-the-Left-Bank energy… just on the Plaza and with better books! \nDoors open at 9:00am\, giving you time to linger\, sip\, and settle in before heading upstairs for the 10:00am event. \nJoin us for a reading and curated discussion followed by an audience Q&A and post event book signing with photo opportunities. \nThis is a ticketed event\, each ticket package includes a signed copy of Paula’s new book Skylark. Signed copies of Rebecca’s beautiful gift book Paris Every Day will also be available for purchase during the ticket registration process and on-site at the event. \nA perfect gathering for Francophiles\, book lovers\, and anyone ready for a little everyday joie de vivre with their favorite people! \nAbout Skylark: \nThe New York Times bestselling author of The Paris Wife weaves a mesmerizing tale of Paris above and below—where a woman’s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 intertwines with a doctor’s dangerous mission during the German occupation in the 1940s\, revealing a story of courage and resistance that transcends time. \n1664: Alouette Voland is the daughter of a master dyer at the famed Gobelin Tapestry Works\, who secretly dreams of escaping her circumstances and creating her own masterpiece. When her father is unjustly imprisoned\, Alouette’s efforts to save him lead to her own confinement in the notorious Salpêtrière asylum\, where thousands of women are held captive and cruelly treated. But within its grim walls\, she discovers a small group of brave allies\, and the possibility of a life bigger than she ever imagined. \n1939: Kristof Larson is a medical student beginning his psychiatric residency in Paris\, whose neighbors on the Rue de Gobelins are a Jewish family who have fled Poland. When Nazi forces descend on the city\, Kristof becomes their only hope for survival\, even as his work as a doctor is jeopardized. \nA spellbinding and transportive look at a side of Paris known to very few—the underground city that is a mirror reflection of the glories above—Paula McLain’s unforgettable new novel chronicles two parallel journeys of defiance and rescue that connect in ways both surprising and deeply moving. \nAuthor: Paula McLain is the New York Times bestselling author of six novels\, including The Paris Wife\, Circling the Sun\, and Love and Ruin\, as well as two collections of poetry and a memoir. Her work has been published in over thirty-five countries\, and featured in The New York Times\, The Guardian\, Town & Country\, Real Simple\, and elsewhere. \nAbout Paris Every Day: \nWhether you’re a seasoned traveler or a first-time visitor\, enjoy the magical view of Paris in this book from Everyday Parisian blogger\, Rebecca Plotnick. \nParis Every Day reveals the City of Light through Rebecca’s photography and offers you the insider knowledge to help cultivate a French frame of mind. \nParis is more than a destination\, it’s a lifestyle. Chocolate or espresso\, flower market or Mus e d’Orsay\, a small park or a favorite rooftop–you’ll find ideas for scouting these and more with photographs that reflect Rebecca’s decades-long love affair with the city. \nParis Every Day is a sublime sortie that explores jazz bars\, picnic spots\, and casual bistros. Find advice for each season\, including how to dress like a Parisian and indulge in the freshest regional produce. All bolstered by fabulous photos that include landmarks like the Luxembourg Gardens and the Eiffel Tower as well as prime places to people watch. \nIt’s not just about the sights; it’s how to best enjoy them. Whether you’re planning a trip or just want an escape\, you will turn to this book again and again for Rebecca’s well-curated wisdom on relishing everyday moments in the City of Light. \nAuthor: Rebecca Plotnick is American and the founder of Every Day Parisian blog. In 2013\, she decided to pack up all her belongings and left Chicago for what would become a nomadic way of living for two years between the United States and France.

SUMMARY:The Freak Accident Record Release Party at The Big Easy
DESCRIPTION:w/ Cut-Rate Druggist and Right To Remain \nRecord release party celebrating the seventh release from The Freak Accident (members of Victims Family\, Hellbillys\,Mongoloid and much more) entitled “The Midnight Show” which drops everywhere on February 6th. \nThe Freak Accident is a Punk/Math/Garage/Pop/Surf/Rock collision led by Victims Family/Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine guitarist-vocalist Ralph Spight. Through numerous line-up they’ve cranked out 4 LP’s and 2 EP’s of genre-hopping smart-ass punk and rock\, equal parts comedy and tragedy and a healthy side of psychedelic noise. The new line-up of bassist Henry Austin Lannan and “Stark Raving” Brad Kopp (Hellbillys\,Marginal Prophets\,Antler Family\,Stark Raving Brad) on drums dropped their first LP/CD together entitled “Outer Space Is Boring” (Nerve Center\, 2023) and has performed throughout Northern California in support of that release playing shows with Dead Bob\, Supersuckers\, The Hangmen\,Middle-Aged Queers\, The Darts and many others and have played after-parties at Mosswood Meltdown. Their new album “The Midnight Show” is a co-release with Nadine Records (the adventurous Portland label run by Nasalrod/Berzerk bass legend Mandy Morgan) is a kitchen sink of punk\,indie\,noise\,psych and surf textures that surprises with every listen. It hits the streets on February 6th\,2026 with regional and national tour dates to follow. \nCut-Rate Druggist is a dynamic duo characterized by dual vocals intertwined with heavy drums and a bass guitar\, culminating in a crushing wall of sound. Their powerful presence on stage earned them opportunities to support renowned acts such as Team Dresch\, Beyond The Lamplight\, The Avengers\, Margaritas Podridas\, The Dollyrots and Betty Blowtorch. \nPetaluma’s own Right To Remain open the show and bring their frantic impassioned hardcore that’s made them a favorite all over Northern California.
