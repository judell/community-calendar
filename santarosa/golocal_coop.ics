When her father is unjustly imprisoned\, Alouette’s efforts to save him lead to her own confinement in the notorious Salpêtrière asylum\, where thousands of women are held captive and cruelly treated. But within its grim walls\, she discovers a small group of brave allies\, and the possibility of a life bigger than she ever imagined. \n1939: Kristof Larson is a medical student beginning his psychiatric residency in Paris\, whose neighbors on the Rue de Gobelins are a Jewish family who have fled Poland.
