SUMMARY:Spike Sikes and His Awesome Hotcakes at The Elephant in the Room
DESCRIPTION:The most frequently heard comment after a Spike’s Awesome Hotcakes gig goes something like this –\n“No one is making this kind of music anymore!”\nBut what\, exactly\, is “this kind of music?”\nLike hotcakes themselves\, it goes by many names. Soul. Swing. Rhythm & Blues. Jazz. Jump. It’s a sound that’s classic and simple\, but when it’s done right\, it hits the spot\, and has you grinning from ear to ear. Spike has spent years searching for this sound.\nFrom the Texas blues joints he cut his teeth in to the funky halls of New Orleans\, he was always studying the music\, trying to find just the right recipe. It makes perfect sense that he found his bandmates in Sonoma County\, a music scene that has fostered many eclectic artists for decades.\nWhat he didn’t know was how hungry audiences were for “this kind of music.” You might say they’ve been eating it up like…Hotcakes!

SUMMARY:Jay Lewellen at the Penngrove Pub
DESCRIPTION:Spending his high school and procrastinated college years in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina\, bluegrass and mountain music found its way into Jay’s heart. Country rock was not only in the air\, it was the air. In the 1970’s there was plenty of blues rock everywhere that was like a bedrock foundation. \nAfter college\, Jay headed for San Francisco. Could there be a more radical cultural shift than the Blue Ridge mountains to San Francisco? Probably not in this country! Diving into the music scene of the Grateful Dead and California music festivals of all sorts\, his musical perspective was pretty much fully formed\, adding some touches of jazz and swing music in there somewhere.

SUMMARY:Joyce DiDonato\, mezzo-soprano Time For Three\, string trio Emily – No Prisoner Be
DESCRIPTION:Emily — No Prisoner Be is a 24-part song cycle composed by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Kevin Puts for Grammy Award winning artists Joyce DiDonato and Time for Three. The music feels at once familiar and new\, brimming with energy\, passion\, and an undeniable chemistry between the performers. Emily Dickinson’s poetry and Puts’ music feel as if they have always belonged together. With atmospheric lighting and strikingly simple staging designed by Andrew Staples\, the performance draws audiences into Dickinson’s inner world. Step into Emily— where every moment is both intimate and infinite.

SUMMARY:Joel Ross’ Good Vibes
DESCRIPTION:The jazz scene is in the midst of a spectacular vibes resurgence\, and the artist at the center of this 21st movement is Joel Ross. \nSince gaining renown a decade ago in with Chicago trumpeter Marquis Hill’s Blacktet he’s brought the instrument to the forefront of the contemporary scene\, with at least a dozen brilliant vibraphonists following in his wake. A gifted composer\, Ross had already appeared on more than a dozen albums as a sideman before releasing his 2019 debut as a leader on Blue Note\, KingMaker\, which earned the 2020 Jazz International Edison Award. With each subsequent album he’s grown as a composer and improviser\, like on his 2022 album-length suite The Parable of the Poet\, which finds his luxuriantly lyrical sensibility energized by his thick\, quick shifting harmonic orchestration. \nRoss’s Good Vibes combo features some of jazz’s most prodigious young players\, anchored by the charismatic bassist Kanoa Mendenhall\, and Tyler Bullock on piano\, Jeremy Dutton on drums\, and Devin Daniels playing alto saxophone. \nClosing the festival on a joyously ringing note\, Ross makes it clear that the vibraphone legacy of Milt Jackson\, Bobby Hutcherson and Steve Nelson is in expert hands.
