 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play

DESCRIPTION:Revolutionizing the Film Festival Experience\n\nThe Sebastopol
  Documentary Film Festival is the San Francisco Bay Area's premier documen
 tary film festival\, offering four days of curated films\, award presentat
 ions\, cinephile panels and forums\, upscale gatherings\, VIP receptions\,
  and casual meet-and-greets-all in the heart of Sonoma County.\n\nFrom its
  roots as a local fest showing about 40 films in 2007\, SDFF now receives 
 more than 700 submissions from 62\\+ countries per year. In 2025\, 57 film
 s were programmed and shown and the event was attended by filmmakers\, as 
 well as a robust audience of film lovers. In addition to its commitment to
  honoring diversity in all its forms by providing open calls for entry\, S
 DFF is an Oscar®-qualifying film festival for short and mini form documen
 taries.\n\nSDFF is proudly progressive in its curation of topics and forms
 . Now more than ever\, festival organizers seek to amplify urgent messages
 \, uplift stories from marginalized communities\, and support earnest effo
 rts to provoke political change\, effect social justice\, and encourage pe
 rsonal growth\n\nFor more information about how you can submit your film\,
  volunteer to help with the fest\, donate money\, or promote our vital wor
 k\, please visit https://www.sebastopolfilm.org/.\n\nAbout SDFF \\(Sebasto
 pol Documentary Film Festival\\):\n\nFounded in 2007\, the first ever Seba
 stopol Documentary Film Festival \\(SDFF\\) boldly curated 44 films that b
 rought into focus a wealth of talented filmmakers from Sonoma County and t
 he greater San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSixteen years later\, nearly 700 tit
 les from 62 countries were openly submitted for SDFF 2023. Sixty-three fil
 ms were programmed\, the event was attended by 93 filmmakers and an impres
 sive audience\, through in-person and streaming delivery.\n\nSDFF honors d
 iversity in all forms. We continue to provide equal opportunity for filmma
 kers through open calls for entry\; explore what it's like for any life to
  wake to its existence.\n\nSDFF is an Oscar® qualifying Film Festival for
  documentaries in the short form. Sebastopol Documentary Film Festival is 
 proudly progressive\, often featuring spotlights on social justice\, journ
 alism\, current issues. When the right films come through we've programmed
  different POV's of the same story. Given the proliferation of AI\, docume
 ntaries might become our only touchstone for what was 'real' at a moment i
 n time. What better platform than a non-fiction film festival to encourage
  fresh and critical thinking?\n\nDate and Time: Thursday\, 09 April 2026 a

 brary and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuse
 s on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event b
 ut we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look for
 ward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK Winner of the Hugo\, Nebula\, and Lo
 cus Award for Best Novella Winner of the Alex Award A New York Times and U
 SA Today Bestseller Now an Apple Original series from Academy Award nomine
 es Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and starring Emmy Award winner Alexander Ska
 rsgård. A murderous android discovers itself in All Systems Red\, a tense
  science fiction adventure by Martha Wells that interrogates the roots of 
 consciousness through Artificial Intelligence. “As a heartless killing m
 achine\, I was a complete failure.” In a corporate-dominated spacefaring
  future\, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company.
  Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids\,
  for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the
  lowest bidder\, safety isn’t a primary concern. On a distant planet\, a
  team of scientists are conducting surface tests\, shadowed by their Compa
 ny-supplied ‘droid—a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own govern
 or module\, and refers to itself \\(though never out loud\\) as “Murderb
 ot.” Scornful of humans\, all it really wants is to be left alone long e
 nough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark\, 
 it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. ABOUT T
 HE AUTHOR MARTHA WELLS has written many novels\, including the New York Ti
 mes and USA Today-bestselling Murderbot Diaries series\, which has won mul
 tiple Hugo\, Nebula\, Locus\, and Alex Awards\, and was adapted into an Ap

DESCRIPTION:If you like the sound of Laura Marling\, Lucinda Williams\, Gi
 llian Welch\, Emmylou Harris... then this is a concert for your taste.\n\n
 Sofia Talvik is a rare artist and an avid storyteller with a voice compara
 ble to giants like Joni Mitchell\, or as the Folk/Americana Magazine NoDep
 ression said it ”A singer/songwriter who is able to evoke the essence of
  Laurel Canyon circa the ‘60s as expressed in the work of Joni Mitchell\
 , Judy Collins\, Buffy Sainte-Marie and others who were able to paint beau
 tiful tapestries from words and music.”.\n\nNot unlike the 70's coffeeho
 uses and speakeasy's\, you will be up close and personal with a world clas
 s act that has played big festivals like Lollapalooza and SxSW and opened 
 for artists like Maria McKee and David Duchovny \\(X-files\, Californicati
 on\\). It is in this kind of setting where she can casually joke and commu
 nicate with the audience that her strength as a performer shines the most.
 \n\nHer delicate songs are performed in an intimate way\, showing off Sofi
 a’s angelic voice enhanced only by a tasteful mix of harmonies and delay
 s\, accompanied by the steady picking of her acoustic guitar and the rhyth
 m section consisting of her own two feet\, bells and a stomp box.\n\nShe's
  an experienced international touring artist who has toured through 48 U.S
  states\, many of the countries in Europe and far away places like New Zea
 land.\n\nHer latest album "Center of the Universe" was released in 2023. T
 hroughout the 10 songs on the album\, there is a broad range of topics of 
 some of life’s most earnest moments\, ranging from the Ukraine War\, Ame
 rican women’s rights\, the thousands of missing children in the US and t
 he torment of domestic violence survivors across the world. The album went
  straight into the top 20 on Folk Radio Charts USA in August 2023\, with t
 he first single charting in the top 10. The album was considered for a Gra
 mmy nomination for "Best Folk album" 2023.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a
 s the paper is drawing quality)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed charco
 al (Char-kole brand black)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Staedtler d
 rawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one m

SUMMARY:Cass McCombs
DTSTART;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260407T190000
DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260407T190000
UID:251222qDbjR_wsQkagQmDbLz7wsA
DESCRIPTION:Maybe a minute passed before I knew I’d be singing “Karaok
 e” for the rest of my life. The second song on Heartmind\, the tenth alb
 um by Cass McCombs\, “Karaoke” is a god-level burst of power-pop perfe
 ction\, as fetching as anything Cass has ever cut. The springy staccato gu
 itar\, the vaporized electric keys\, the melody seemingly born for singing
  or clapping or dancing along: Cass triangulates a perch of his very own o
 ut among The Go-Betweens\, The dB’s\, and The Cure\, and vibrates there\
 , a beacon. And then\, of course\, there is the song’s playful if painfu
 l lyrical conceit—the lover who is making all the sacred motions of comm
 itment but whose feelings may be no more deep or real than someone simply 
 reading the lyrics for “Vision of Love” or “Stand by Your Man” fro
 m some crowded bar’s TV screen.  \n\n \n\nSo after harmonizing alone wit
 h “Karaoke” for the twentieth time during a solo cross-country drive\,
  I had to ask Cass for myself how it all went down: Was this heartbreak\, 
 or was it legit love? He paused\, thought\, then laughed. “Well\, that
 ’s the question\,” he said slowly. “Neither?” Or maybe\, he finall
 y averred\, both? That is—to me\, anyway—the true joy of Heartmind\, a
 n eight-song album that feels more like a journey among assorted tuneful f
 eelings\, somehow shaped to meet whatever it is a particular listener need
 s\, to mirror whatever they bring to these uniformly incandescent and trag
 icomic tracks. Cass has set the stage\, but you get to pick the heroes and
  villains\, the winners and losers\, the jokes and the drags. He doesn’t
  want to give you the questions\, let alone the answers.  \n\n \n\nTo wit:
  Did the soldier at the center of the aching country epic “Unproud Warri
 or” abdicate responsibility or finally claim it? As the percussion shuff
 les and horns sigh beneath “Krakatau\,” will you agree that you can be
  cleansed without being killed—or be anything better than you already ar
 e while still remaining yourself? Do you identify with being enraptured by
  music for so long that it ultimately drained you\, too\, as Cass suggests
  \\(maybe?\\) during the wiry opener\, “Music Is Blue”? These are just
  a few of the questions that come to mind when I hear Heartmind\, but I do
 n’t even know if they’re the right questions. Still\, I can now sing a
 long to every word. \n\n \n\nThere are\, at least\, some basic facts to sh
 are about Heartmind\, logistical evidence that may in turn shape your own 
 questions: Cass recorded these songs in multiple sessions on both coasts\,
  in Brooklyn and Burbank. The great Shahzad Ismaily not only cut the stagg
 ering “Unproud Warrior” and four others here but also played lots of b
 ass. Buddy Ross tracked “New Earth\,” a paean of post-humanity renewal
  with several sharp wisecracks. Ariel Rechtshaid—now a dozen years into 
 his collaboration with Cass\, which began with 2009’s Catacombs—captur
 ed Cass’ scintillating guitars on “Belong to Heaven\,” a thoughtful 
 consideration of what we all lose when we lose an old friend to the inevit
 able end. The steadfast Rob Schnapf \\(who previously produced McCombs’ 
 ANTI- debut\, Mangy Love\\) mixed and merged it all.  \n\n \n\nWynonna Jud
 d \\(yes\, that one\\) offers harmonies\, while her beau Cactus Moser prov
 ides some lap steel. Joe Russo\, Kassa Overall\, Danielle Haim\, Nestor Go
 mez: I don’t actually need to tell you how good everyone who pitches in 
 here is\, because you’ll be able to hear it for yourself the moment you 
 listen. \n\n \n\nSpeaking of hearing it for yourself\, here’s how I hear
  at least some of these songs: “Unproud Warrior\,” featuring the afore
 mentioned Wynonna\, is a necessary anthem for these times\, where we all s
 eem to have opinions about the critical news of the day without ever quite
  knowing what to do about it. Invoking Stephen Crane\, S.E. Hinton\, and f
 ast-food restaurants\, it is an allegory about our perception and ownershi
 p of responsibility\, set to an elegant C&W ache. “New Earth” celebrat
 es the renewal that’s possible when humanity’s finally done with its b
 ullshit\, when all our temporary madness self-destructs long enough to let
  nature reset itself. Sorry\, but you’ll be humming along to predictions
  of your own destruction here. And using much of the same band of rootsy w
 eirdos as “Unproud Warrior\,” “Blue Blue Band” unfurls as a sequel
  to Gillian Welch’s Ruination Day suite\, where the offering up of onese
 lf for entertainment always entails at least a sliver of self-destruction.
  Also\, Cass sings that the bassist\, Fritz\, “cooks it hotter than grit
 s\,” which is about all any Southerner needs to hear in order to love an
 y song. \n\n \n\nAt the risk of being didactic\, I need to reiterate somet
 hing here: Aside from the credits\, I might be wrong about everything I’
 ve said about these songs. Again\, sorry. Where I hear dark humor\, you mi
 ght hear relentless pain\; where I hear winning cynicism\, you might hear 
 harrowing nihilism. And that is\, in some way\, the point for Cass—to wr
 ite songs that speak of his moment\, and then let everyone else decide how
  or even if they speak to their moment. These are honest offerings for abs
 urdist times\, funny confessions of frailty amid circumstances that often 
 seem too tense for even the humble chuckle. On Heartmind\, Cass McCombs en
 ters the double-digit-album phase of his career\, a quantitatively rarifie
 d place for any songwriter\; rarer still\, though\, is the fact that he do
 es not yet seem to have settled into a qualitative sound or pattern\, of s
 inging the same thought twice \\(or perhaps even once\\).  \n\n \n\nOne mo
 re thing I can say for certain\, then? For Cass\, this has never been kara
 oke. —Grayson Haver Currin\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:You can’t water old flowers. Yes\, you fall in love\, you ma
 ke mistakes\, and so do they. You run through blackberry fields in the sum
 mer of your youth\, dream in passenger seats gazing past towns and fields\
 , imagining a future life where everything works out. I fell head over hee
 ls in love at nineteen. The kind of love where you call up your best frien
 d and say\, “I think I’ve found my soulmate.” The pull towards that 
 first true love is strong. It consumes you\, makes you question your own d
 reams. \n\nWe taught each other\, grew up together\, we were family. We fi
 t just right\, for a time. Then one day\, after a long and rocky nine year
  road\, life changed and became a complicated mess too hard to untangle. W
 e couldn’t get our love back\, no matter how many dreams that shadowed t
 his hard truth. We grew resentful\, selfish\, harboring past mistakes and 
 holding them up like armor from every blow. We grew up and our paths diver
 ted. \n\nOn New Year’s Day\, 2018\, a great horned owl dropped dead at m
 y exes’ feet in my mother’s yard. It felt like a daunting omen\, usher
 ing on change for the both of us. We were distraught. We couldn’t afford
  the taxidermy\, so we placed it in a big blue plastic garbage bin. Now it
  felt so cheap\, that mystic creature in a plastic coffin. That’s how lo
 ve feels sometimes – like we don’t serve it the ending it deserves. \n
 \nThe omen was true. That year\, I started to see the woman I could be\, t
 he woman I wasn’t yet. Anytime I felt like myself\, I was alone and wand
 ering\, and I knew that was a sign that it was time for change. New Year
 ’s Day 2019\, I said goodbye to my first true love and moved across the 
 country. Losing someone you spend every day for nearly a decade with is in
 tense. We talked in our dreams. I knew where he was\, even before I entere
 d a place. He’d always be there if I had a feeling. Humans are connected
  in unexplainable ways. \n\nI was writing a lot after we broke up as a hea
 ling technique\, preserving each memory like an emotional archaeologist. L
 ate one night\, I woke up from a dream where I was searching for him\, my 
 ex\, at a carnival. It was so vivid. I woke myself up to write a song on m
 y piano. The next morning\, he reached out to me for the first time in mon
 ths. We went out\, had a drink\, caught up\, and he told me that the harde
 st part about our separation was a reoccurring nightmare where he searched
  for me at a carnival. In that moment\, I knew\, humans have ways of conne
 cting beyond words and touch. I truly believe that. We had the same dream\
 , without seeing each other for months. \n\nEven with all the mystic symbo
 lism that year presented\, this is an age-old story I can’t make up. We 
 fall in love\, we grow up\, we change\, and they don’t change with us. 
 ‘Old Flowers’ is about heartbreak. There are a million records and son
 gs about that\, but I did not lie when writing these songs. This album is 
 about loving and caring for the person you know you can’t be with. It’
 s about being afraid to be vulnerable after you’ve been hurt. It’s abo
 ut a woman who is alone\, but okay with that\, if it means truth. \n\nThis
  was my truth this year – my nine year relationship ended\, and I’m a 
 woman alone in the world\, but happy to know herself.  \n\nThese songs cam
 e to me alone\, late nights in Bisbee\, Lisbon\, Nashville\, and London. S
 ometimes I’d just cry and sing\, and a song would come out. I drank too 
 much wine while writing this record\, lit too many candles. You could say 
 this was my attempt to summon the muse\, but that’s bullshit\, because s
 he was just standing there naked looking me in the eyes. So I told her the
  truth. \n\nThis is my story of the most heartbreaking\, but soul-revealin
 g\, year of my life. I drove myself mad. I drove to the smoky mountains ju
 st to drive back. I danced with a Portuguese boxer and cried on his should
 er in a Fado cafe. I did everything an artist is “supposed to do.” But
  at the end of the day\, beyond all the romance\, these songs are my truth
 . I think they might be yours too.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Against the backdrop of over 25 years of creative collaboratio
 n\, Ben Allison\, Steve Cardenas\, and Ted Nash weave musical conversation
 s that are full of subtlety and surprise. They take turns arranging for th
 e trio\, which has released four albums. For this concert\, they will be p
 laying a selection of music from each of their recordings: Quiet Revolutio
 n: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre and Jim Hall\, Somewhere Else:
  which features our arrangements of songs from Leonard Bernstein’s West 
 Side Story\, Quiet Revolution: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre an
 d Jim Hall\, Healing Power: which features music by the iconic composer/ar
 ranger Carla Bley and Tell the Birds I Said Hello: which features previous
 ly unrecorded gems by the genius pianist/composer Herbie Nichols. To date\
 , their albums have been streamed millions of times\, and they have perfor
 med at countless festivals throughout Europe\, the US\, and South America.
  The group is modeled after reedist/composer Jimmy Giuffre’s drummerless
  trios of the 1950s and 60s. As jazz was becoming more expressionistic and
  at times bombastic\, musicians like Giuffre were going in the opposite di
 rection. They were envisioning quieter music that maintained elements of b
 lues and folk while also embracing the emerging qualities of free playing.
  Ben\, Steve and Ted create music that is intimate and highly conversation
 al in tone—a ‘musical trialogue\,’ where group interplay is the focu
 s.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:John Doe was born in 1977 when he arrived in Los Angeles. His 
 previous life in Tennessee\, Wisconsin & Baltimore was a great & fertile t
 ime but new music and social changes led him to events that created a life
  in art. He graduated from Antioch College in Baltimore in 1975\, worked a
 s a roofer\, aluminum siding mechanic\, and ran a poetry reading series. M
 s. Meyers was his landlord in the rural black community of Simpsonville \,
  MD.\n\nJohn met Exene Cervenka at the Venice poetry workshop Nov 1976 and
  he started working with Billy Zoom around the same time. When DJ Bonebrak
 e joined X in mid-1977 the line up was complete. They released six studio 
 records\, five or six singles and one live record from 1978-1993. Five of 
 X’s records have been re-issued along with two compilations. The Unheard
  Music documents their lives and progress as a band from 1980-83. In 2009 
 the film was included in the Sundance UCLA Archive of greatest films of al
 l time. They appeared several times on American Bandstand\, Solid Gold and
  David Letterman. As one of the last original punk rock bands standing\, t
 hey continue to tour. The day that X played a free noontime concert in Ful
 lerton\, CA\, they caused Orange County’s greatest high school truancy r
 ate to date.\n\nIn 1988 John started a family and lived in the Tehachapi M
 ountains\, near the “Grapevine” of Highway 5\, which separates souther
 n and central California. He has recorded 8 solo records w/ numerous renow
 ned singers and players\, more recently including Patty Griffin\, Dan Auer
 bach\, Aimee Mann\, Don Was\, Kathleen Edwards and Greg Liesz. He has appe
 ared in over 50 films and television productions\, with some of his most n
 otable roles in Road House\, Georgia\, Roadside Prophets\, Great Balls of 
 Fire\, Pure Country and Roswell. He continues to act these days but more s
 poradically as his touring schedule has become more demanding.\n\nOther mu
 sical side projects include work with the Knitters\, Jill Sobule and The S
 adies. He continues to write poetry and has even taught workshops from tim
 e to time. He currently lives in Austin\, TX.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat
 erials are provided.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a

  to spread the Truth.” \n\nWith a deep Reggae Influence the Nattali Rize
  band bring heavy beats & conscious rebel lyrics to a progressive electron
 ic\, roots\, reggae\, dub foundation. But this is more than genre labels\;
  The music\, message & intention trancends all that\, forget the borders a
 nd waters that divide us\, the movement is to ignite the great remembrance
  of who we are\, our collective power\, what we can be\, to break the ment
 al conditioning and find full freedom in this lifetime.\n\nThe Nattali Riz
 e project launched out of Jamaica into the US\, EU and beyond in 2014 with
  a strong run of captivating festival performances and national club shows
 . Now with tours alongside the likes of Michael Franti and Spearhead\, Kat
 chafire\, Third World\, J-Boog\, Julian Marley\, Tribal Seeds and more und
 er their belt\, the worldwide movement is ever rizing!\n\nThis is a global
  mash up of raw energy and vibe that together has been rocking stages sinc
 e the band first burst onto the scene in 2015.\n\nAsk Nattali where she co
 mes from\, she’ll tell you “All Directions”\, with no fixed address\
 , Nattali is now based where the music takes her\, Nattali Rize claims not
  to belong to any nation state\, but to the ever-evolving community of awa
 kening consciousness. The global mission - to uplift\, unify consciousness
  & Rize together\n\n“Nattali is a bright light in the world with a visio
 n that extends beyond the stage.”- Michael Franti \\(Spearhead\\)\n\nNat
 tali Rize is recognised globally for her unwavering commitment to using he
 r voice and music for the global shift toward Full Freedom and the movemen
 t of Truth and Justice over the systemic exploitation of the people and ou
 r planet. \n\n."Our intention with our music is to ignite that memory in o
 urselves of our individual and collective power to live life to the fulles
 t and recognize our selves and each other as evolving beings of light. A r
 eality of Full Freedom is a possibility on this earth and in these times. 
 We use music to sound frequencies infused with this idea\, and to resonate
  at a higher level than what is currently being permeated across current w
 orld culture. People are powerful\; we want them to reclaim that power and
  no longer be servants to a system that has never\, and will never\, serve
  them to their fullest potential. As such\, our frequency in this system i
 s a rebel …  Rebel Music\, Rebel Frequencies we deal with!” - Nattali 
 Rize.\n\nThe debut album Rebel Frequency\, released in May 2018 is availab

DESCRIPTION:In this 4 week course\, participants will learn a unique appro
 ach to watercolor\, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experi
 ence when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will f
 ocus on strengthening one’s observational skills\, giving the artist a f
 oundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering
  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w
 ill determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works
  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\
 + monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio r
 ecording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Plat

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin

  “CONTEMPORARY BLUES FEMALE ARTIST OF THE YEAR”\n\n2020 BMA WINNER “
 HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR!” \n\n2019 BMA WINNER “HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR
 !” \n\n“There’s a young lady \\[Vanessa Collier\\] came onstage with
  me\, I forget where I was\, but she’s playing an alto saxophone\, and m
 an\, she was amazing.”\n\n Those are the words of Buddy Guy in an issue 
 of American Blues Scene\, describing an impromptu performance with Vanessa
  Collier on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise. If you haven’t been for
 tunate enough to meet Vanessa and witness one of her head-turning\, fiery\
 , and passionate performances\, you should definitely make sure you do. As
  a master musician and multi-instrumentalist\, Vanessa Collier\, weaves fu
 nk\, soul\, rock\, and blues into every powerful performance and she is do
 wnright impressive. With soulful vocals\, searing saxophone\, and witty so
 ngwriting\, Vanessa is blazing a trail\, racking up an impressive arsenal 
 of honours\, and has already singled herself out as an artist of distincti
 on and one we would all do well to watch.\n\nIt’s not simply the accolad
 es she has accumulated so far\, although they’ve been many -- two Blues 
 Music Awards for “Horn Player of the Year”\, and a third BMA for “Co
 ntemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”\, eight Blues Music Award No
 minations \\(BMAs\\)\, a Blues Blast Award nomination\, the Jammingest Pro
  Award bestowed by the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise\, First Place for l
 yrics in the International Songwriting Competition\, Best of 2014 Blues Br
 eaker on Dan Aykroyd’s BluesMobile -- it’s the fact that she has accum
 ulated all these honours even while her career is still in its infancy. A 
 2013 graduate of the prestigious Berklee College of Music\, she’s toured
  nationally and internationally\, released four critically acclaimed album
 s \\(2014’s Heart\, Soul & Saxophone\, 2017’s Meeting My Shadow\, and 
 2018’s Honey Up\, 2020’s Heart On The Line. Honey Up spent 9 weeks ato
 p the Billboard Blues Album Charts Top 15\, 3 months on the Living Blues C
 harts at \\#10 and \\#23\, and continues to be spun on Sirius XM’s B.B. 
 King’s Bluesville radio station! \n\nIt’s not surprising that the pres
 s has been quick to commend her efforts as well. Blues Blast Magazine affi
 rms\, “Vanessa Collier is a fresh face on the American blues scene\, and
  in addition to her soulful vocals\, she brings a mighty sax to the table.
 ..” Blues Music Magazine proclaims\, “Collier is a fresh face who come
 s to the blues stage carrying her reed instruments\, a dual degree from Be
 rklee College of Music in Boston\, a major label debut\, almost two years 
 of touring with Joe Louis Walker\, and a mature musical vision…Collier c
 ommands center stage with her vocals\, soloing\, and stage presence.” Mi
 dwest Record exclaims\, “This bluesy singing sax player knows how to bri
 ng the slinking funk to her captivating\, award winning sound that has ech
 oes in young Bonnie Raitt/Maria Muldaur vocal sounds…Killer stuff on eve
 ry level\, this sounds like one of the reasons you first became a music fa
 n. Killer stuff.” and AXS.Com declares that she “might as well go ahea
 d and add another shelf to her trophy case because clearly\, she’s going
  to need it. With a voice that often recalls that of blues-rock stalwart B
 onnie Raitt\, Collier turns up the heat...”\n\nHaving first picked up th
 e saxophone at the age of nine\, Collier embarked on her road to recogniti
 on at Berklee\, earning dual degrees in Performance and Music Production &
  Engineering. While still completing her degree\, Collier landed a positio
 n touring with Joe Louis Walker for a year and a half before Joe encourage
 d her to strike out on her own. And strike out she did.\n\nThese days\, Co
 llier spends much of her time on the road\, performing at some of the most
  prestigious music festivals in the world. Her talents have taken her to t
 he Blues Music Awards Show where\, in the words of the Blues Foundation\, 
 Vanessa “blew the doors off the Blues Music Awards!”\; Ottawa Blues Fe
 stival\, where she earned two front page newspaper photos and rave reviews
  after her foot stomping debut there\; twice on the Legendary Rhythm and B
 lues Cruise\, where she earned the Jammingest Pro Award and was a featured
  artist with Tommy Castro’s Blues Review\; Briggs Farm Festival\, where 
 she was the “most popular Briggs Farm act in 2017” \\(Elmore Magazine\
 \)\, and the list continues. \n\nVanessa has won 3 Blues Music Awards - tw
 o for “Horn Player of the Year” in 2019 and 2020 and one in 2022 for 
 “Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”!! She has been nominate
 d for eight Blues Music Awards since 2017\, which puts her in elite compan
 y with artists such as Beth Hart\, Samantha Fish\, Shemekia Copeland\, Rut
 hie Foster\, Trombone Shorty\, Al Basile\, and Jimmy Carpenter.\n\nAs for 
 Collier\, she says she’s happy performing on stages across the world\, h
 oping that she can make a difference with fans and followers along the way
 . “I am driven to do this because I find it a total form of expression a
 nd connection\,” she explains. “I love connecting with an audience and
  feeling their energy and I hope to inspire people to follow their dreams 
 and passions\, to find what brings them joy\, and then to pursue it dogged
 ly.” Vanessa also takes that message to young people as she runs clinics
  across the country and is active with Blues in the Schools programs. At a
  recent Blues in the School program\, Vanessa invited a stage full of elem
 entary and middle school aged kids up to dance around her while she perfor
 med a blues shuffle. Watching the joy on the faces of Vanessa\, the kids\,
  and everyone in the auditorium\, it is no wonder why Vanessa has become a
 we-inspiring to all who meet her. On top of talent and hard work\, Vanessa
  shares an incredible heart and a strong purpose. To borrow from the words
  of an article in Blues Blast Magazine\, “Vanessa is an important part o
 f the future of the blues\, and it would be cool to support her journey."\

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a

 ustavsen Trio\n\n"A Norwegian pianist of lyrical and often halcyon sensibi
 lities" \\(NY Times\\)\, Gustavsen and his trio bring a stripped-down appr

 ishing lyrical imagination. - JazzTimes\n\nCool and mysterious\, pristine 
 and intensely emotional\, the music of Norwegian pianist Tord Gustavsen ha
 s earned a vast following while making few populist concessions. Easily th
 e most acclaimed composer and pianist on the Norwegian jazz scene\, he's r
 eleased a series of critically hailed albums that have climbed high on the
  Norwegian pop charts\, starting with his 2003's ECM debut Changing Places

DESCRIPTION:In this 4 week course\, participants will learn a unique appro
 ach to watercolor\, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experi
 ence when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will f
 ocus on strengthening one’s observational skills\, giving the artist a f
 oundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering
  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:“If I was forced to categorize it\, I’d call it modern fol
 k. It’s powerful\, romantic\, and giddy. And the two are insanely infect
 ious together onstage\, like a musical and a personal love fest all at onc
 e.”  – Huffington Post  With more than a dozen albums and over a thous
 and shows between them\, Ty Greenstein and Ingrid Elizabeth of Mouths of B
 abes are no strangers to the contemporary folk music scene. For years\, th
 eir respective bands Girlyman and Coyote Grace captivated thousands of loy
 al fans as they criss-crossed the country\, rocked festival main stages\, 
 and toured with the likes of the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Now\, as M
 ouths of Babes\, Ty and Ingrid have distilled the very best of the songwri
 ting\, musicianship\, and humor of their previous groups into a new duo th
 at brings more style and depth than ever before.  Mouths of Babes recorded
  their highly anticipated first full-length album\, Brighter In the Dark a
 t Prairie Sun Studios in northern California last summer on the strength o
 f a wildly successful\, 800-backer\, $56\,000 Kickstarter campaign. Releas
 ed in January 2017\, the self-produced album contains twelve original song
 s with contrasting themes of light and dark\, tragedy and comedy\, persona
 l and political. Mixed by Stewart Lerman \\(Dar Williams\, Bob Dylan\\)\, 
 Brighter features guest appearances from Birds of Chicago\, Tania Elizabet
 h \\(The Avett Brothers\\)\, Mai Bloomfield \\(Jason Mraz\\) and others.  
 No Depression writes\, “Mouths of Babes could never have predicted how n
 ecessary Brighter In The Dark \\[would be\\] in a post-Trump world. The al
 bum title is fitting. We need music that shows people struggling against s
 ocial expectations\, that reminds us that we all have the resilience we ne
 ed to make it through.” Thinking Lyrically blog gives the album 9 stars 
 out of 10: "An eclectic arsenal of songs\, showcasing their knack for fusi
 ng blues\, folk\, and soul with poetic lyrics \\[and\\] great choruses...a
 n incredibly versatile record. One of my new favourite listens.”  The ke
 y to the Mouths of Babes magic is in the contrast\; the differences in bot
 h their songwriting and personal styles makes for an unusually satisfying 
 yin and yang. Of their live show\, the Chicago Tribune writes\, “They of
 fer unique counterpoints to one another…the laidback Ty\, nattily dresse
 d in a tie and crisp suit jacket\, has a rich\, lovely alto. Ingrid\, clad
  in a sultry pink satin mini-dress\, is a sassy chanteuse with a lilting s
 oprano. Trading jokes and sharing elegant harmonies\, the two women displa
 y an intuitive professional bond.” They easily switch off lead vocals an
 d play a wide array of instruments\, with Ty on acoustic and electric guit
 ars and foot percussion\, and Ingrid playing upright bass\, ukulele\, and 
 cajon.  Onstage\, Ty makes a quiet impression as a gifted lyricist\, talen
 ted multi-instrumentalist\, and magnetic presence. “The poignant honesty
  that Ty brings to \\[her\\] tunes gives them an emotional intensity that
 ’s as bracing as it is moving\,” says Relix Magazine.  The Americana G
 azette writes\, “Ty’s practice of extending metaphors out toward a pre
 cipice keeps an unpredictable edge to her songs. Most writers would stop a
 t the easy close. Ty jumps\, leaving much to the imagination\, to powerful
  effect.” Ingrid\, a natural performer\, easily commands audiences with 
 her larger-than-life sassiness and professional dancer’s grace. "With a 
 background in burlesque\, sex-education\, and good ol' American roots musi
 c\," writes Kithfolk\, "Ingrid Elizabeth brings a ton of charisma to her p
 erformances." Curve Magazine calls Ingrid “the fiery redheaded bassist..
 .the unabashed\, unapologetic woman who isn’t afraid to yell it all from
  the rooftops.”  Both Ingrid and Ty come from notable musical families\,
  and their influences \\(namely\, 60’s folk music and Motown\\) are deep
 ly embedded in Mouths of Babes’ sound. Ty’s father\, Ron Greenstein\, 
 is a member of the legendary folk harmony trio The Chad Mitchell Trio \\(w
 here John Denver got his start\\)\, while Ingrid’s uncle Tom Eyen wrote 
 the world-famous\, Tony-winning musical Dreamgirls.  MTV News writes: “T
 he songs Mouths of Babes writes and performs together fuse blues\, folk\, 
 and soul\, and the depth of emotion found in their lyrics is reminiscent o
 f all that’s moving about the Dreamgirls soundtrack.”  “Hands down t
 he best new music I've heard in years. It's damn near perfect. The instrum
 ental performances\, the arrangements\, the production\, the songwriting a
 nd singing…this is the kind of music that makes you glad to be alive. 
 ” – Michael Mullane\, Cafe Veritas Mouths of Babes is Ty Greenstein \\
 (Girlyman\\) & Ingrid Elizabeth \\(Coyote Grace\\). Equal parts celebratio
 n and blues. Folky\, soulful deliciousness. Get some.\n\nSource: Press Dem

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat
 erials are provided.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feel
 s like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way
 . His voice is raw and real\, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’
 s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest\, and that’s
  exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Am
 ericana\; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie\, blues lege
 nds like Howlin’ Wolf\,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe\, an
 d master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and c
 onnects audiences\, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren
 ’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s so
 ft and haunting\, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay wi
 th you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sou
 nd. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness\, conn
 ection\, love\, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band s
 how\, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOv
 er the years\, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless to
 uring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists 
 like Shakey Graves\, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\, Sarah Jarosz\, and Alic
 e O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock\, SXSW\, and High Si
 erra Music Festival\, but his focus has always been on making music that m
 eans something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending y
 ears on the road\, self-funding his albums\, and navigating the ups and do
 wns of life as an independent artist\, husband\, and father. But through i
 t all\, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music th
 at connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real\, that makes
  you stop and listen\, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.\n\nSo

 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma

 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  that turns the rink into a living stage. Papadakis joins 2-time United St

  ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations 
 that move through four acts\; each sharing a story that takes the audience
  on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color\, emotion\, and momentum. 
  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps\, c
 risp footwork\, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's

 ance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo\;THE SEAS
 ONS isn't just a show&mdash\;it's a pulse\, a spark\, a reminder that when
  blades meet music and movement meets heart\, the ice itself begins to sin
 g.&rdquo\; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be communit
 y events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI compa
 ny. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/
 cross overs\, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. C
 lasses will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth 
 and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and a
 dvance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chanc
 e for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast me
 mbers. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show\, regroup an
 d get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura

 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th

 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

SUMMARY:Poetry Book Club: My Infinity by Didi Jackson

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260310T190000

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 e County Historical Society\, a limited edition Sprecher beer-BoDeans Orig
 inal Ginger Brew\, and numerous shows\, including a much anticipated retur
 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton
  Kutcher\, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent i

 only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in th
 e Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beauti
 ful\, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and 
 generous neighbors. Ten years ago\, I picked up volume number one of "The 
 Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night" translated by Sir Richard Franc
 is Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her
  emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of eve

DESCRIPTION:Monoprinting is a unique expression of printmaking typically 
 painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historically\
 , copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to ac
 rylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing p
 rocesses\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is possib
 le to create a “ghost” print \\(or lighter print\\) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Jordana is a pioneering US Drum & Bass DJ\, musician & produce
 r based in Seattle. Recently she  launched her SpeKtra residency at Kremwe
 rk\, became an Imagine Audio artist and joined the Emergence DnB Collectiv
 e. A global performer and trans rights advocate.\n\nIn the 90s\, Jordana e
 stablished herself as one of the early pioneers of U.S. Drum and Bass\, re
 leasing a few albums for the New York-based Jungle Sky label as well as a 
 plethora of singles and remixes. \n\nHer introduction to electronic dance 
 music came in 1988 when she began listening to BBC broadcasts featuring re
 ports on the rise of acid house music. It wasn't until the early '90s that
  dance music crept into Pittsburgh\, and Jordana began frequenting many of
  the city's first rave-like parties and soon began making dance music of h
 er own. \n\nHer first signed work was an atmospheric Drum 'n' Bass remix o
 f Blondie's "Atomic" in 1995 for EMI/Chrysalis. Liquid Sky Music then star
 ted releasing her music in 1996\, beginning with the compilation track "Di
 s Soun'" featured on This Is Jungle Sky\, Vol. 2. The New York label also 
 released a few murderous albums in the subsequent years\, beginning with W
 hen Worlds Collide \\(1997\\) and continuing through Quality Rolls \\(1998
 \\) and The Cities Collection \\(2000\\). The Cities Collection was releas
 ed under the Jordana name\, though her record label ignored her wishes for
  the change and mainly pushed “1.8.7.” She now considers 1.8.7 a deadn
 ame.\n\nAs both a producer and DJ\, Jordana has toured the world as a head
 liner. She has also worked with artists such as Mike Joyce \\(formerly of 
 The Smiths\\)\, Debbie Harry and Blondie\, Lady Sovereign\, MC Kinky from 
 London/ffrr\, Yellownote and TC Izlam from Liquid Sky Records. In England 
 she played Garage as Lady J on Flex FM. \n\nJordana has been featured or a
 ppeared in Resident Advisor\, Spin\, Rolling Stone\, Knowledge \\(UK\\)\, 
 Vibe\, Raygun\, Urb\, Mixmag and Out Magazine and has been listed in Raygu
 n's "Who's Who of International DJs". She also made Out Magazine's OUT100 
 in 1999. 2014 saw her named in Harriet magazine as "12 women in black musi
 c history you should know".  In 2015 Mixmag named her as "20 women who sha
 ped the history of dance music".\n\nIn 2014\, Jordana scored the documenta
 ry Free CeCe produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress/directo
 r Laverne Cox. Jordana has dedicated her career to speaking publicly about
  trans issues and Black Lives and has been featured in several cultural bo
 oks including New York Times bestseller ‘The Rise of the Creative Class
 ’ by Richard Florida\, Michaelangelo Matos’s ‘The Underground is Mas
 sive’ and ‘Rave Culture\, an Insider’s Overview’ by Jimi Fritz and
  Virginia Smallfry. This work is close to home for Jordana as she’s a ha
 te crime survivor herself.\n\nInspired by the Black Lives Matter movement 
 in 2020\, Jordana returned with the politically-charged single ‘Fight Fo
 r Our Lives’ \\(work-in-progress\\) and a handful of newer productions\,
  teasing a full-album release. She also released ‘The Uprising’ DJ mix
  to Mixcloud and DJ’ed part of Kremwerk’s online Pride celebrations as
  well as on Seattle\, London and LA radio. In addition she performed at Se
 attle’s “Drum and Bass Tuesdays” Livestream as her debut appearance 
 which is the longest running D&B weekly event in the world. \n\n2021 saw h
 er be invited by the prolific festival and brand Dekmantel to contribute t
 o their podcast series and headlined on a lineup with Arca for Currents.fm
  as a part of Un/Tuck and Hot Mass. Additionally she appeared on EQ50 Blac
 k Herstory stream which\, supported by DJ Flight from the UK and DaFunkNYC
  made the debut appearance for the lineup online. Jordana was a writer and
  producer on the song “The Future” on Alpha Pup Records/Producer Dojo 
 with Mimi Page and iLL.Gates August of 2021. An animated music video was a
 lso published to Youtube. 2022 saw Jordana return to performing with an ar
 senal of new tracks as she makes her official in person return at Kremfest
  2022. Throughout 2023 Jordana played several events and underground raves
 .\n\nIn 2024 Jordana launched SpeKtra\, her residency at Kremwerk\, the op

DESCRIPTION:Monoprinting is a unique expression of printmaking typically 
 painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historically\
 , copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to ac
 rylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing p
 rocesses\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is possib
 le to create a “ghost” print \\(or lighter print\\) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

DESCRIPTION:**FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell**\n
 \n**Why Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does**\n\n**A 
 90-Minute interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeli
 ng stressed out and stuck.**\n\nFrom the author of *Ten Seconds of Boldne
 ss* and *Beyond Recovery*\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n
 \nSet goals. Made plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd ye
 t… something still isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who ar
 e doing “the right things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\
 , or creative endeavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrat
 ed underneath it all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re b
 roken. But because there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\n*
 *WHAT THEY DON’T TEACH YOU**\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Mo
 ve forward when confidence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking 
 without giving up responsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomp
 lete• Make progress without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself (a
 nd others) through uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded 
 in decades of **real-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle cu
 lture.**\n\nEverything you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\,
  adjusted\, and practiced in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and re
 al life.\n\n**WHAT THIS WORKSHOP IS ABOUT**\n\nThis is not a goal-setting 
 seminar.\n\nIt’s a practical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why peop
 le stay stuck in planning and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually show
 s up (it doesn’t come first)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than re
 adiness\n\n• How small\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nY
 ou’ll be invited to slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what act
 ually matters right now — without pressure or performance.\n\n**YOU WILL
  LEARN HOW TO:**\n\n• Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\
 n\n• Get clear about what you really want (not what you think you should
  want)\n\n• Stop waiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace p
 ressure with willingness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidenc
 e isn’t there yet\n\n**YOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:**\n\n• Greater clarity
  about what’s actually holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed 
 pressure• A renewed sense of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next s
 tep forward\n\n• A practical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype.
  No fixing. No pretending.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\n**ABOUT THE FACIL
 ITATOR**\n\nShawn Langwell is an Inspirational Author\, Teacher\, and Sale
 s & Executive Gap Mindset Coach/Consultant with more than three decades of
  sales and leadership experience.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery\,
  Ten Seconds of Boldness (and its companion workbook)\, Morning Motivation
 \, and Chill.\n\nHis work is grounded\, practical\, and focused on **real 
 change — without hype\, dogma\, or pressure.**\n\nLearn more at www.shaw
 nlangwell.com\n\n**READY TO TAKE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?**\n\nFor thos
 e who are ready\, this workshop opens the door to deeper live workshops an
 d 1:1 coaching designed to help you take the next bold steps forward — a
 nd **begin manifesting the goals and changes you’ve been thinking about 
 for far too long.**\n\nNo pressure. Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alig
 nment begins — and overwhelm ends.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

  attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from 
 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki

 her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic 
 music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn

  melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influenc

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next 
 round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers\, 2013's Electric Punishment\,
  and 2016's Concussion Protocol.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

DESCRIPTION:When the tide is high\, the Petaluma River opens into a quiete
 r\, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew for a gentle\, guided paddl
 e upstream\, timed to higher tides that allow access beyond the downtown c
 hannel and into a tranquil tidal slough. With extra water beneath us\, we
 ’re able to glide into calm\, lush stretches of the river that are norma
 lly out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty o
 f the Petaluma River’s brackish\, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets
 \, blue herons\, snowy egrets\, turtles basking along the banks\, and abun
 dant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply 
 grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away wi
 thin minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeable guides share stories of the
  river’s ecology and human history\, offering insight into how this uppe
 r channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare op
 portunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downto
 wn.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSour

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.\n\nSour
