DESCRIPTION:Conservation Dinner Series: Bill Leikam "The Fox Guy" of  Urba
 n Wildlife Research Project joins us in the elephant room after dinner to 
 give a talk about grey foxes. The conservation dinner series is compliment
 ary to all dinner guests. If you want to attend this presentation\, please
  call our reservations team at \\(707\\) 566-3667 or \\(800\\) 616-2695 an
 d they can book it for you. Dinner starts at 7:00 PM. About the Speaker   
  Science has been a fundamental part of Bill's life starting when he was j
 ust a teenager. In the 1970s\, he conducted original research into the nat
 ure of consciousness that led to being a member in 1981 as one of an 18 me
 mber Scientific Delegation to the People's Republic of China where he pres
 ented his research on alternate modes of healing. During the 1980s\, he sp
 oke at conferences across the country both on consciousness and the psycho
 logy and neurophysiology of boredom. As of 2018\, nine years ago\, Bill be
 gan documenting\, photographing and studying the behavior of the gray fox\
 , something that has never before been done in such a comprehensive way. T
 his study resulted in the development of the Urban Wildlife Research Proje
 ct. He introduced his work to videographer and naturalist Greg Kerekes and
  welcomed him on board to join in with the research. They are dedicated to
  developing viable habitat and connectivity corridors for the gray fox and
  other wildlife living to the east of Highway 101 and the shore of the San
  Francisco Bay. Their work has attracted a good deal of attention by the p
 ress. They give highly acclaimed presentations about their work to corpora
 te\, private\, and an array of wildlife organizations. Bill is also known 
 as the Fox Guy. Organizations with which we are involved and have partnere
 d with: National Wildlife Federation\, Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildl
 ife Refuge\, Pathways for Wildlife\, and CuriOdyssey at Coyote Point They 
 are presently engaged with the Midpeninsula Open Space and Peninsula Open 
 Space Trust \\(POST\\)\, both of which they have consulted with over the p
 ast two years. Additionally\, Bill is an associate board member of the Gua
 dalupe - Coyote Resource Conservation District \\(GCRCD\\) that covers a v
 ery large section of the Diablo Mountain Range on the eastern side of Sili
 con Valley and the Santa Cruz Mountains on the western side of the valley.
  The GCRCD is involved in habitat development\, creek and river restoratio
 n\, salmon and steelhead protection\, watershed issues throughout the GCRC
 D's jurisdiction\, planning with biodiversity at the center of all project
 s\, working with farmers and ranchers to improve practices\, protection of
  endangered species is just the overview of their work. Bill aka the Fox G
 uy said\, "I grew up on the banks of the Corralitos Creek\, a wild creek f
 lowing from the Santa Cruz Mountains\, down the western slopes\, and throu
 gh our backyard. This initiated my love of creeks\, fish\, wildlife\, and 
 the pace\, the rhythm of the seasons."\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w
 ill determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works
  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\
 + monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio r
 ecording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Plat
 form\n\nQ&As: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press

 ing along the banks\, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful
  surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they 
 feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeab
 le guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history\, offer
 ing insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shap
 e—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild natur
 e lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks

 s. If you want to attend this presentation\, please call our reservations 
 team at \\(707\\) 566-3667 or \\(800\\) 616-2695 and they can book it for 
 you. Dinner starts at 7:00 PM. About Susan Lutter:    Putting passion for 
 gorillas to work Friends‘ founder Susan Lutter first visited Ape Action 
 Africa in 2007\, with the objective of seeing first-hand the work being do
 ne to save the endangered gorillas of Cameroon. "I expected to be awed by 
 the animals - and they are amazing - but I was simply overwhelmed by the t
 alent and dedication of the people who are changing their lives for the be
 tter." She returned home to California\, committed to using her business b
 ackground to help raise awareness and support for the sanctuary. In the de
 cade since that first visit\, Susan has reached out to partners who have p
 rovided a wide range of funding and materials for the animals\, the staff 
 and the communities. "It is critical to rescue and rehabilitate the orphan
 ed primates\, but it is our human behavior that has to change in order to 
 save them in the long run. Ape Action's work with their neighboring commun
 ities is respectful and unflagging\, and it is working." Friends of Ape Ac
 tion Africa raises no funds for itself. Any and all work is done at the pe
 rsonal expense of its volunteers\, and all revenue raised through various 
 activities is sent straight to Ape Action Africa \\(via their US 501\\(c\\
 )\\(3\\) charity\\).\n\nSource: Press Democrat

 ization conducting innovative research on wild felid species in the Bay Ar
 ea and in targeted regions across the globe. Zara has led multiple startup
  ventures in technology\, biotechnology\, healthcare and private equity. S
 he formed Felidae in 2006 after a transformative encounter on a Bay Area t
 rail with a mountain lion. The benign encounter compelled her to question 
 the prevailing narrative of the dangerous predator\, leading to further qu
 estions about how wild felids influence ecosystems and biodiversity\, espe
 cially at the urban-wildland interface\, and how we can succeed at co-exis
 tence. She has worked throughout the world researching snow leopards\, tig
 ers\, cheetahs\, leopards\, and multiple lesser known small cat species in
  Asia\, Africa and South America. Zara is also a former competitive marath
 oner and ultra-runner\, as well as a longtime insight meditation practitio

 grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away wi
 thin minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeable guides share stories of the
  river’s ecology and human history\, offering insight into how this uppe
 r channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare op
 portunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downto

 “Loretta's well-crafted writing prompts sparked a writer inside me that 
 I didn't know I had… I left feeling invigorated\, accomplished and proud
  of myself for trying something new.”\n\n“I'm neither a writer nor a d
 ancer\, but Loretta made it easy to put aside my inhibitions and let my em
 otional body lead the way… I recommend this class for anybody at all!”
 \n\n"It felt delicious to dive into my creative moving and language self w
 ith others. For days after\, I felt both emptied and filled up creatively 
 in ways that I hadn’t felt in a long time."\n\n"I felt refreshed\, renew
 ed\, and like I had processed some emotional blockages… The paths were o
 pened and the words just flowed."\n\nCome move and write with us! Visit ww

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w
 ill determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works
  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\
 + monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio r
 ecording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Plat

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260610T190000

DESCRIPTION:Over the course of crafting a 29-album catalog and architectin
 g 40 Billboard \\#1 singles as a keyboardist\, songwriter and producer\, B
 rian Culbertson has charted his own unique course in music. Label him jazz
  and he makes a funk record. Call him an R&B artist and he drops an acoust
 ic jazz trio collection. Brand him pop and he creates a 32-minute New Age 
 opus. And you’d be hard pressed to name another instrumentalist of his i
 lk who can mount an elaborately designed concert production that will keep
  him on the road for three consecutive months. \n\nCulbertson burst onto t
 he scene in 1994 with a chart-topping album that he recorded in his colleg
 e apartment featuring keyboard-led contemporary jazz tracks. “Long Night
  Out” landed him a lengthy record deal and signaled that a star was born
 . Flash forward to present day\, Culbertson has been going back and listen
 ing more and more to music that inspired him as a young musician such as D
 avid Sanborn\, The Brecker Bros\, Chick Corea\, Al Jarreau\, Pat Metheny\,
  and others in the jazz fusion world.  \n\n“It instantly brought me back
  to the days of ‘no rules’ and the pure joy of music\, something that 
 I think a lot of albums today are lacking. With that said\, I set out to w
 rite and produce a new album that would try to capture a little bit of tha
 t late 70’s and early 80’s spirit of music exploration\, along with us
 ing only live musicians and real instruments.  Similar in style to “Anot
 her Long Night Out”\,\n\n“Day Trip” is the daytime version!” said 
 Culbertson. \n\nPossessing style\, panache\, and a savvy business mind cap
 able of moving the needle in music and beyond\, Culbertson founded and cur
 ates the annual Napa Valley\, New Orleans\, and Chicago Jazz Getaways\, wh
 ich have attracted guests from all over the globe to experience his premie
 r events. \n\nWhether you’re listening to music from “Day Trip” on r
 ecord or live in concert\, you’re hearing an eclectic\, entertaining and
  engaging set from an artist at the peak of his power.\n\nSource: Press De

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\
 ; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(req
 uired!\\): Monthly \\(12\\)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home
  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w
 ill determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works
  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu
 ided meditations\, readings\, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\
 + monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio r
 ecording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Plat
 form\n\nQ&As: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press

DESCRIPTION:Founded in 2016 by classical pianist Hunter Noack\, IN A LANDS
 CAPE: Classical Music in the Wild is a 501\\(c\\)\\(3\\) nonprofit outdoor
  concert series where America's most stunning landscapes replace the tradi
 tional concert hall. A 9-foot Steinway grand piano travels on a flatbed tr
 ailer to State and National Parks\, urban greenspaces\, working ranches\, 
 farms\, and historical sites for classical music concerts that connect peo
 ple with each landscape. To meet the acoustical challenges of performing i
 n the wild\, music is transmitted to concert-goers via wireless headphones
 . No longer confined to seats\, audiences explore the landscape\, wander t
 hrough secret glens\, lie in sunny meadows\, and roam old growth forests. 
 IN A LANDSCAPE has presented 275 concerts in Oregon\, Washington\, Montana
 \, Idaho\, New York\, Utah\, Wyoming\, and California to over 55\,000 peop
 le. Folks travel from near and far. Local ranchers\, loggers\, and farmers
  gather with visiting city dwellers and tourists from beyond.\n\nSource: P

DESCRIPTION: Air: Mental Alchemy Shadow Work\n\nTea &amp\; Tarot &bull\; T
 he Alchemy of Thought\n\nSunday\, May 17\n\nAir is the realm of the mind &
 mdash\; language\, memory\, belief\, perception\, and meaning. It shapes h
 ow we interpret reality and how reality responds to us. In this Air-themed
  Tea &amp\; Tarot gathering\, we enter the subtle territory of mental shad
 ow work: the unconscious thought forms\, internalized voices\, and belief 
 systems that quietly influence our choices\, communication\, and sense of 
 self.\n\nMental shadow is not simply &ldquo\;negative thinking.&rdquo\; It
  includes inherited narratives\, protective strategies of the psyche\, int
 ernalized authority\, and unexamined assumptions that once served a purpos
 e but now restrict growth. Through tarot\, we gently bring these patterns 
 into conscious awareness\, where they can be met with discernment rather t
 han suppression.\n\nThis is not a therapeutic intervention\, nor is it pre
 dictive. It is a sacred inquiry into how the mind constructs meaning &mdas
 h\; and how awareness restores agency.\n\nWhat We'll Explore\n\n    &bull\
 ;    The origins of recurring thought loops and mental habits\n\n    &bull
 \;    Internalized voices from family\, culture\, or past experiences\n\n 
    &bull\;    How fear\, control\, or avoidance shape perception\n\n    &b
 ull\;    Where clarity\, truth\, or expression is being unconsciously rest
 rained\n\n    &bull\;    The difference between intuition\, thought\, and 
 conditioned belief\n\nAir teaches us that thought is creative &mdash\; but
  not all thoughts are true. When we learn to listen beneath the noise of t
 he mind\, we reclaim authorship of our inner world and restore integrity t
 o our voice.\n\nSource: Press Democrat

DESCRIPTION:When the tide is high\, the Petaluma River opens into a quiete
 r\, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew for a gentle\, guided paddl
 e upstream\, timed to higher tides that allow access beyond the downtown c
 hannel and into a tranquil tidal slough. With extra water beneath us\, we
 ’re able to glide into calm\, lush stretches of the river that are norma
 lly out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty o
 f the Petaluma River’s brackish\, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets
 \, blue herons\, snowy egrets\, turtles basking along the banks\, and abun
 dant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply 
 grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away wi
 thin minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeable guides share stories of the
  river’s ecology and human history\, offering insight into how this uppe
 r channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare op
 portunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downto
 wn.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSour

 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play

 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th

 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo

 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used

  contributors. The result is one of Halford’s most approachable and easy
 -grooving.\n\nHis latest album release\, SOUL CRUSADE\, is the follow-up t
 o the critically acclaimed record WEST TOWARDS SOUTH. The album came out i
 n Europe on Continental Song City\, debuted in September at \\#2\, and the
 n undisputedly reached \\#1 in October 2022 and stayed in the chart for fo
 ur months. \n\nJEFFREY HALFORD & THE HEALERS are gearing up for their eigh
 th European tour in September and October 2025\, bringing their signature 
 blend of raw rock ‘n’ roll\, country\, and soul back to the stage. But
  this tour isn’t just another run—it marks the 25th anniversary of KER
 OSENE\, the album \\(release date Friday\, August 29th\, 2025\\) that put 
 Halford on the map as a true Americana troubadour.\n\nSource: Press Democr

DESCRIPTION:If you listen to just a few tracks from his latest album\, you
  might think Creed Fisher was born with a guitar in his hand. One after an
 other his songs remain relevant today\, yet steeped with tradition classic
 s that everyone else already knows and you don’t want to miss. Clearly h
 e’s sharing his own stories\, with experiences that range from great vic
 tories to deep battle scars. \n\nFisher hails from Odessa\, TX\,  where hi
 s family’s roots trace back to his granddad\, who was highly involved in
  the oil game back in the fifties. However\, Fisher took on a different pa
 ssion when he started playing football at the age of 10\, which eventually
  led to the Minor Leagues for 9 years. \n\nBut\, as his football career ca
 me to a close\, Fisher also saw his marriage of twelve years come to an en
 d. It was at this point he decided to do some serious “soul searching”
 . Fisher tells us that the music simply “found him” during this time. 
 He picked up a guitar in 2010 and never let it go\; and after touring tire
 lessly for 4 years\, Fisher moved from West Texas to a small town outside 
 of San Antonio\, TX\, where he put together a new band\, and picked up whe
 re he left off.\n\nFisher’s second album "Ain't Scared To Bleed" went To
 p 30 on the ITunes Country charts and continues to be embraced by fans all
  around the world. When it came to his 3rd album "Rednecks Like Us" it was
  reviewed by Country Music People magazine and got 4 out of 5 stars. Here 
 is what they had to say...\n\n“Creed Fisher sings and writes with the co
 nfidence and authority of someone who has been at it for a hell of a lot l
 onger than 6 years. He is at his strongest on the ballads\, but tackles th
 e ‘angry redneck’ stuff just as well. There’s the odd moment when it
  can all get a bit crashy and loud for me\, but I’d say the same about H
 ank Jr. All things considered\, this is very impressive indeed and I’d l
 ike to see Creed Fisher go far.\n\nFriends and fans alike anxiously await 
 Creed Fisher’s release of his 4th album. There is no denying that Fisher
  is truly speaking from passion when it comes to his music. Fisher is the 
 guy you meet that you feel like you’ve known all your life and his music
  feels like the songs you’ve been singing since you first discovered mus
 ic. His lyrics\n\nare comfortable\; his story\, genuine\; his spirit\, hum
 ble and his talent\, undeniable.”\n\nCountry Music People Magazine \n\n-
  September 2016\n\n- Duncan Warwick \n\nRecently in 2021\, he’s been bac
 k on the road touring and will be looking forward to putting out new music
  for his fans.\n\nSource: Press Democrat
