DESCRIPTION:Genealogy Society of Vallejo-Benicia&'s August speaker is Cand
 ice Buchannan. Her topic is "The Genealogy of a House". Candice Buchanan i
 s a reference librarian at the Library of Congress\, specializing in local
  history and genealogy. As a teenager in search of a haunted mausoleum she
  discovered her ancestors' tombstones\, launching a lifelong determination
  to identify past generations. Buchanan is a board-certified genealogist w
 ith a master's in public history from Duquesne University. Prior to joinin
 g the Library\, she worked as a genealogist and archivist for Memory Medal
 lion Inc.\, Genealogists.com and the Greene County\, Pennsylvania\, Orphan
 s' Court. Viewing the past through the lens of family or local history can
  create a bond between the present day researcher and their ancestors or t
 he past residents of their communities. That bond enables the distant even
 ts of national history to be seen from a more personal\, memorable\, and t
 angible perspective GSVB Members will automatically receive a Zoom invitat
 ion that will be sent out a couple of days before the meeting. Non-Members
 : If you are interested in attending\, please send an e-mail to  GSVBzoom@
 gmail.com to request a Zoom invitation. The Zoom meeting time is at 1:30 p
 m Pacific Time. The event is FREE. All are welcome.\n\nSource: North Bay B

 give a talk about grey foxes. The conservation dinner series is compliment
 ary to all dinner guests. If you want to attend this presentation\, please
  call our reservations team at \\(707\\) 566-3667 or \\(800\\) 616-2695 an
 d they can book it for you. Dinner starts at 7:00 PM. About the Speaker   
  Science has been a fundamental part of Bill's life starting when he was j
 ust a teenager. In the 1970s\, he conducted original research into the nat
 ure of consciousness that led to being a member in 1981 as one of an 18 me
 mber Scientific Delegation to the People's Republic of China where he pres
 ented his research on alternate modes of healing. During the 1980s\, he sp
 oke at conferences across the country both on consciousness and the psycho
 logy and neurophysiology of boredom. As of 2018\, nine years ago\, Bill be
 gan documenting\, photographing and studying the behavior of the gray fox\
 , something that has never before been done in such a comprehensive way. T
 his study resulted in the development of the Urban Wildlife Research Proje
 ct. He introduced his work to videographer and naturalist Greg Kerekes and
  welcomed him on board to join in with the research. They are dedicated to
  developing viable habitat and connectivity corridors for the gray fox and
  other wildlife living to the east of Highway 101 and the shore of the San
  Francisco Bay. Their work has attracted a good deal of attention by the p
 ress. They give highly acclaimed presentations about their work to corpora
 te\, private\, and an array of wildlife organizations. Bill is also known 
 as the Fox Guy. Organizations with which we are involved and have partnere
 d with: National Wildlife Federation\, Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildl
 ife Refuge\, Pathways for Wildlife\, and CuriOdyssey at Coyote Point They 
 are presently engaged with the Midpeninsula Open Space and Peninsula Open 
 Space Trust \\(POST\\)\, both of which they have consulted with over the p
 ast two years. Additionally\, Bill is an associate board member of the Gua
 dalupe - Coyote Resource Conservation District \\(GCRCD\\) that covers a v
 ery large section of the Diablo Mountain Range on the eastern side of Sili
 con Valley and the Santa Cruz Mountains on the western side of the valley.
  The GCRCD is involved in habitat development\, creek and river restoratio
 n\, salmon and steelhead protection\, watershed issues throughout the GCRC
 D's jurisdiction\, planning with biodiversity at the center of all project
 s\, working with farmers and ranchers to improve practices\, protection of
  endangered species is just the overview of their work. Bill aka the Fox G
 uy said\, "I grew up on the banks of the Corralitos Creek\, a wild creek f
 lowing from the Santa Cruz Mountains\, down the western slopes\, and throu
 gh our backyard. This initiated my love of creeks\, fish\, wildlife\, and 
 the pace\, the rhythm of the seasons."\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bo

DESCRIPTION:When the tide is high\, the Petaluma River opens into a quiete
 r\, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew at their central downtown d
 ock for a gentle\, guided paddle upstream\, timed to higher tides that all
 ow access beyond the downtown channel and into a tranquil tidal slough. Wi
 th extra water beneath us\, we’re able to glide into calm\, lush stretch
 es of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle h
 ighlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish\, tidal wa
 terway. Watch for great egrets\, blue herons\, snowy egrets\, turtles bask
 ing along the banks\, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful
  surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they 
 feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeab
 le guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history\, offer
 ing insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shap
 e—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild natur
 e lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks 
 and all gear provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:Conservation Dinner Series: Susan Lutter of  Ape Action Africa
  joins us in the elephant room after dinner to give a talk about Apes of A
 frica. The conservation dinner series is complimentary to all dinner guest
 s. If you want to attend this presentation\, please call our reservations 
 team at \\(707\\) 566-3667 or \\(800\\) 616-2695 and they can book it for 
 you. Dinner starts at 7:00 PM. About Susan Lutter:    Putting passion for 
 gorillas to work Friends‘ founder Susan Lutter first visited Ape Action 
 Africa in 2007\, with the objective of seeing first-hand the work being do
 ne to save the endangered gorillas of Cameroon. "I expected to be awed by 
 the animals - and they are amazing - but I was simply overwhelmed by the t
 alent and dedication of the people who are changing their lives for the be
 tter." She returned home to California\, committed to using her business b
 ackground to help raise awareness and support for the sanctuary. In the de
 cade since that first visit\, Susan has reached out to partners who have p
 rovided a wide range of funding and materials for the animals\, the staff 
 and the communities. "It is critical to rescue and rehabilitate the orphan
 ed primates\, but it is our human behavior that has to change in order to 
 save them in the long run. Ape Action's work with their neighboring commun
 ities is respectful and unflagging\, and it is working." Friends of Ape Ac
 tion Africa raises no funds for itself. Any and all work is done at the pe
 rsonal expense of its volunteers\, and all revenue raised through various 
 activities is sent straight to Ape Action Africa \\(via their US 501\\(c\\
 )\\(3\\) charity\\).\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

 he formed Felidae in 2006 after a transformative encounter on a Bay Area t

 cially at the urban-wildland interface\, and how we can succeed at co-exis
 tence. She has worked throughout the world researching snow leopards\, tig

  Asia\, Africa and South America. Zara is also a former competitive marath

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bo

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260610T190000

DESCRIPTION:Over the course of crafting a 29-album catalog and architectin
 g 40 Billboard \\#1 singles as a keyboardist\, songwriter and producer\, B
 rian Culbertson has charted his own unique course in music. Label him jazz
  and he makes a funk record. Call him an R&B artist and he drops an acoust
 ic jazz trio collection. Brand him pop and he creates a 32-minute New Age 
 opus. And you’d be hard pressed to name another instrumentalist of his i
 lk who can mount an elaborately designed concert production that will keep
  him on the road for three consecutive months. \n\nCulbertson burst onto t
 he scene in 1994 with a chart-topping album that he recorded in his colleg
 e apartment featuring keyboard-led contemporary jazz tracks. “Long Night
  Out” landed him a lengthy record deal and signaled that a star was born
 . Flash forward to present day\, Culbertson has been going back and listen
 ing more and more to music that inspired him as a young musician such as D
 avid Sanborn\, The Brecker Bros\, Chick Corea\, Al Jarreau\, Pat Metheny\,
  and others in the jazz fusion world.  \n\n“It instantly brought me back
  to the days of ‘no rules’ and the pure joy of music\, something that 
 I think a lot of albums today are lacking. With that said\, I set out to w
 rite and produce a new album that would try to capture a little bit of tha
 t late 70’s and early 80’s spirit of music exploration\, along with us
 ing only live musicians and real instruments.  Similar in style to “Anot
 her Long Night Out”\,\n\n“Day Trip” is the daytime version!” said 
 Culbertson. \n\nPossessing style\, panache\, and a savvy business mind cap
 able of moving the needle in music and beyond\, Culbertson founded and cur
 ates the annual Napa Valley\, New Orleans\, and Chicago Jazz Getaways\, wh
 ich have attracted guests from all over the globe to experience his premie
 r events. \n\nWhether you’re listening to music from “Day Trip” on r
 ecord or live in concert\, you’re hearing an eclectic\, entertaining and
  engaging set from an artist at the peak of his power.\n\nSource: North Ba

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bo

 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda

  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda

DESCRIPTION: Air: Mental Alchemy Shadow Work\n\nTea &amp\; Tarot &bull\; T
 he Alchemy of Thought\n\nSunday\, May 17\n\nAir is the realm of the mind &
 mdash\; language\, memory\, belief\, perception\, and meaning. It shapes h
 ow we interpret reality and how reality responds to us. In this Air-themed
  Tea &amp\; Tarot gathering\, we enter the subtle territory of mental shad
 ow work: the unconscious thought forms\, internalized voices\, and belief 
 systems that quietly influence our choices\, communication\, and sense of 
 self.\n\nMental shadow is not simply &ldquo\;negative thinking.&rdquo\; It
  includes inherited narratives\, protective strategies of the psyche\, int
 ernalized authority\, and unexamined assumptions that once served a purpos
 e but now restrict growth. Through tarot\, we gently bring these patterns 
 into conscious awareness\, where they can be met with discernment rather t
 han suppression.\n\nThis is not a therapeutic intervention\, nor is it pre
 dictive. It is a sacred inquiry into how the mind constructs meaning &mdas
 h\; and how awareness restores agency.\n\nWhat We'll Explore\n\n    &bull\
 ;    The origins of recurring thought loops and mental habits\n\n    &bull
 \;    Internalized voices from family\, culture\, or past experiences\n\n 
    &bull\;    How fear\, control\, or avoidance shape perception\n\n    &b
 ull\;    Where clarity\, truth\, or expression is being unconsciously rest
 rained\n\n    &bull\;    The difference between intuition\, thought\, and 
 conditioned belief\n\nAir teaches us that thought is creative &mdash\; but
  not all thoughts are true. When we learn to listen beneath the noise of t
 he mind\, we reclaim authorship of our inner world and restore integrity t
 o our voice.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda
 ys @ 7:30pm\, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins\, no inter

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda

DESCRIPTION:**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for
  laughs\, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues tha
 t make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n*
 **The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that del
 ves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The
  narrative centers on Emily Penrose\, the exacting editor-in-chief of a pr
 estigious magazine\, who assigns Jim Fingal\, an ambitious young fact-chec
 ker\, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. 
 As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece\, he discovers numerous embellis
 hments\, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy 
 versus creative license. This fast-paced\, blistering comedy offers a time
 ly exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing\, where the quest fo
 r truth becomes a battleground of wit\, ethics\, and editorial judgment.**
 \n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provokin
 g themes\, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling\, how far can 
 one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturda

 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play

  contributors. The result is one of Halford’s most approachable and easy
 -grooving.\n\nHis latest album release\, SOUL CRUSADE\, is the follow-up t
 o the critically acclaimed record WEST TOWARDS SOUTH. The album came out i
 n Europe on Continental Song City\, debuted in September at \\#2\, and the
 n undisputedly reached \\#1 in October 2022 and stayed in the chart for fo
 ur months. \n\nJEFFREY HALFORD & THE HEALERS are gearing up for their eigh
 th European tour in September and October 2025\, bringing their signature 
 blend of raw rock ‘n’ roll\, country\, and soul back to the stage. But
  this tour isn’t just another run—it marks the 25th anniversary of KER
 OSENE\, the album \\(release date Friday\, August 29th\, 2025\\) that put 
 Halford on the map as a true Americana troubadour.\n\nSource: North Bay Bo

 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?*

DESCRIPTION:If you listen to just a few tracks from his latest album\, you
  might think Creed Fisher was born with a guitar in his hand. One after an
 other his songs remain relevant today\, yet steeped with tradition classic
 s that everyone else already knows and you don’t want to miss. Clearly h
 e’s sharing his own stories\, with experiences that range from great vic
 tories to deep battle scars. \n\nFisher hails from Odessa\, TX\,  where hi
 s family’s roots trace back to his granddad\, who was highly involved in
  the oil game back in the fifties. However\, Fisher took on a different pa
 ssion when he started playing football at the age of 10\, which eventually
  led to the Minor Leagues for 9 years. \n\nBut\, as his football career ca
 me to a close\, Fisher also saw his marriage of twelve years come to an en
 d. It was at this point he decided to do some serious “soul searching”
 . Fisher tells us that the music simply “found him” during this time. 
 He picked up a guitar in 2010 and never let it go\; and after touring tire
 lessly for 4 years\, Fisher moved from West Texas to a small town outside 
 of San Antonio\, TX\, where he put together a new band\, and picked up whe
 re he left off.\n\nFisher’s second album "Ain't Scared To Bleed" went To
 p 30 on the ITunes Country charts and continues to be embraced by fans all
  around the world. When it came to his 3rd album "Rednecks Like Us" it was
  reviewed by Country Music People magazine and got 4 out of 5 stars. Here 
 is what they had to say...\n\n“Creed Fisher sings and writes with the co
 nfidence and authority of someone who has been at it for a hell of a lot l
 onger than 6 years. He is at his strongest on the ballads\, but tackles th
 e ‘angry redneck’ stuff just as well. There’s the odd moment when it
  can all get a bit crashy and loud for me\, but I’d say the same about H
 ank Jr. All things considered\, this is very impressive indeed and I’d l
 ike to see Creed Fisher go far.\n\nFriends and fans alike anxiously await 
 Creed Fisher’s release of his 4th album. There is no denying that Fisher
  is truly speaking from passion when it comes to his music. Fisher is the 
 guy you meet that you feel like you’ve known all your life and his music
  feels like the songs you’ve been singing since you first discovered mus
 ic. His lyrics\n\nare comfortable\; his story\, genuine\; his spirit\, hum
 ble and his talent\, undeniable.”\n\nCountry Music People Magazine \n\n-
  September 2016\n\n- Duncan Warwick \n\nRecently in 2021\, he’s been bac
 k on the road touring and will be looking forward to putting out new music
  for his fans.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian

 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th

 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi

 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?*

DESCRIPTION:What if Mozart’s music could surprise you with new colors yo
 u didn’t know you were missing? This program shines a spotlight on two o
 f his favorite voices: the basset horn and the basset clarinet. Deeper\, w
 armer\, and more velvety than their modern descendants\, these instruments
  were prized in Mozart’s time for their ability to sing\, sigh\, and whi
 sper with uncanny intimacy.\n\nThe program begins with a charming quintet 
 by Mozart’s contemporary Johann Backofen\, whose writing shows off the b
 asset horn’s mellow glow and conversational wit. Mozart’s youthful “
 Milanese” string quartet follows\, sparkling with elegance and invention
 . The program culminates in Mozart’s beloved clarinet quintet\, a work o
 f timeless beauty\, virtuosity\, and ingenuity performed here on a replica
  of the original basset clarinet Mozart had in mind. Performed on period i
 nstruments\, this concert offers a chance to hear familiar music scrubbed 
 clean—lighter\, more transparent\, and irresistibly alive.\n\nSource: No

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n

  course\, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intend
 ed to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this be
 autiful yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s obs
 ervational drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to
  build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the 
 artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna 
 – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginne
 rs and experienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgivin
 g drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor
  Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share 
 her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in waterc
 olor. This class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicin
 g observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six clas
 s sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skill
 s and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a min
 d of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All mat

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex

 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio

 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\n

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long a
 s the paper is drawing quality)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed charco
 al (Char-kole brand black)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Staedtler d
