DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next 
 round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers\, 2013's Electric Punishment\,
  and 2016's Concussion Protocol.

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb
 aud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid\, an OLLI instructor for Son
 oma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture\, we will be discuss
 ing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not o
 nly delicious dessert paintings\, but also landscapes and figures. In this
  discussion\, we will look at his famous works\, review his life\, and lea

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

 servations: https://www.exploretock.com/jamcellars/\n\n-\n\nRising star Mi
 chelle Lambert brings a world of experience when she steps up to the micro
 phone. This Pop singer/songwriter has toured from coast to coast making wa
 ves all over the country. Michelle's 2021 single Come to Me has caught the
  attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from 
 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki
 ng music ever since. A pop folk and hip-hop artist whose career has taken 
 her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic 
 music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn
  more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n"Michelle Lambert is the kind of ele
 ctric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Wh
 ether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a c
 onfident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between 
 the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the sta

 rt is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!"\n\n-Den
 nis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a
  melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influenc
 es when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emo
 tional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishe
 s in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWh
 y Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute 
 interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stresse
 d out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyo
 nd Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Mad
 e plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something s
 till isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the r
 ight things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\, or creative en
 deavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrated underneath it
  all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But becau
 se there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T
  TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when conf
 idence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up re
 sponsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progres
 s without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) throu
 gh uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of re
 al-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle culture.\n\nEverythi
 ng you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\, adjusted\, and prac
 ticed in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and real life.\n\nWHAT THI
 S WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a pra
 ctical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in plannin
 g and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t com
 e first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How s
 mall\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited t
 o slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what actually matters right 
 now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• 
 Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about w
 hat you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop w
 aiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willing
 ness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\
 n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually
  holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed se
 nse of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next step forward\n\n• A pra
 ctical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretendin
 g.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell i
 s an Inspirational Author\, Teacher\, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Co
 ach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experi
 ence.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery\, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(
 and its companion workbook\\)\, Morning Motivation\, and Chill.\n\nHis wor
 k is grounded\, practical\, and focused on real change — without hype\, 
 dogma\, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TA
 KE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready\, this workshop 
 opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help 
 you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals a
 nd changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. 
 Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Jordana is a pioneering US Drum & Bass DJ\, musician & produce
 r based in Seattle. Recently she  launched her SpeKtra residency at Kremwe
 rk\, became an Imagine Audio artist and joined the Emergence DnB Collectiv
 e. A global performer and trans rights advocate.\n\nIn the 90s\, Jordana e
 stablished herself as one of the early pioneers of U.S. Drum and Bass\, re
 leasing a few albums for the New York-based Jungle Sky label as well as a 
 plethora of singles and remixes. \n\nHer introduction to electronic dance 
 music came in 1988 when she began listening to BBC broadcasts featuring re
 ports on the rise of acid house music. It wasn't until the early '90s that
  dance music crept into Pittsburgh\, and Jordana began frequenting many of
  the city's first rave-like parties and soon began making dance music of h
 er own. \n\nHer first signed work was an atmospheric Drum 'n' Bass remix o
 f Blondie's "Atomic" in 1995 for EMI/Chrysalis. Liquid Sky Music then star
 ted releasing her music in 1996\, beginning with the compilation track "Di
 s Soun'" featured on This Is Jungle Sky\, Vol. 2. The New York label also 
 released a few murderous albums in the subsequent years\, beginning with W
 hen Worlds Collide \\(1997\\) and continuing through Quality Rolls \\(1998
 \\) and The Cities Collection \\(2000\\). The Cities Collection was releas
 ed under the Jordana name\, though her record label ignored her wishes for
  the change and mainly pushed “1.8.7.” She now considers 1.8.7 a deadn
 ame.\n\nAs both a producer and DJ\, Jordana has toured the world as a head
 liner. She has also worked with artists such as Mike Joyce \\(formerly of 
 The Smiths\\)\, Debbie Harry and Blondie\, Lady Sovereign\, MC Kinky from 
 London/ffrr\, Yellownote and TC Izlam from Liquid Sky Records. In England 
 she played Garage as Lady J on Flex FM. \n\nJordana has been featured or a
 ppeared in Resident Advisor\, Spin\, Rolling Stone\, Knowledge \\(UK\\)\, 
 Vibe\, Raygun\, Urb\, Mixmag and Out Magazine and has been listed in Raygu
 n's "Who's Who of International DJs". She also made Out Magazine's OUT100 
 in 1999. 2014 saw her named in Harriet magazine as "12 women in black musi
 c history you should know".  In 2015 Mixmag named her as "20 women who sha
 ped the history of dance music".\n\nIn 2014\, Jordana scored the documenta
 ry Free CeCe produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress/directo
 r Laverne Cox. Jordana has dedicated her career to speaking publicly about
  trans issues and Black Lives and has been featured in several cultural bo
 oks including New York Times bestseller ‘The Rise of the Creative Class
 ’ by Richard Florida\, Michaelangelo Matos’s ‘The Underground is Mas
 sive’ and ‘Rave Culture\, an Insider’s Overview’ by Jimi Fritz and
  Virginia Smallfry. This work is close to home for Jordana as she’s a ha
 te crime survivor herself.\n\nInspired by the Black Lives Matter movement 
 in 2020\, Jordana returned with the politically-charged single ‘Fight Fo
 r Our Lives’ \\(work-in-progress\\) and a handful of newer productions\,
  teasing a full-album release. She also released ‘The Uprising’ DJ mix
  to Mixcloud and DJ’ed part of Kremwerk’s online Pride celebrations as
  well as on Seattle\, London and LA radio. In addition she performed at Se
 attle’s “Drum and Bass Tuesdays” Livestream as her debut appearance 
 which is the longest running D&B weekly event in the world. \n\n2021 saw h
 er be invited by the prolific festival and brand Dekmantel to contribute t
 o their podcast series and headlined on a lineup with Arca for Currents.fm
  as a part of Un/Tuck and Hot Mass. Additionally she appeared on EQ50 Blac
 k Herstory stream which\, supported by DJ Flight from the UK and DaFunkNYC
  made the debut appearance for the lineup online. Jordana was a writer and
  producer on the song “The Future” on Alpha Pup Records/Producer Dojo 
 with Mimi Page and iLL.Gates August of 2021. An animated music video was a
 lso published to Youtube. 2022 saw Jordana return to performing with an ar
 senal of new tracks as she makes her official in person return at Kremfest
  2022. Throughout 2023 Jordana played several events and underground raves
 .\n\nIn 2024 Jordana launched SpeKtra\, her residency at Kremwerk\, the op
 ening night featured Flava D and the night brought in DJs such as Mizeyesi
 s and a special Pride Month edition brought over B-Complex. Jordana and B-
 Complex also collaborated on a track featuring Zak Meow called Lorem Ipsum
 . She also joined the Emergence DnB Collective.

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 inal Ginger Brew\, and numerous shows\, including a much anticipated retur
 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton

  are transferred from Damacus\, Syria\, to Jerusalem\, Jordan in late 1955

 only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in th

 ful\, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and 
 generous neighbors. Ten years ago\, I picked up volume number one of "The 
 Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night" translated by Sir Richard Franc
 is Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her
  emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of eve
 ry young\, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volume

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:Join us at Snoopy's Home Ice for an evening of art and athleti
 cism of Dance on Ice.\n\nSnoopy's Home Ice\n\nMarch 13th 2026 at 7PM\n\nOl
 ympic Champion Gabriella Papadakis leads Ice Dance International's new tou
 r\, THE SEASONS&mdash\;a celebration of artistry\, athleticism\, and speed
  that turns the rink into a living stage. Papadakis joins 2-time United St
 ates Champion Alissa Czisny and skating artist Rohene Ward in a company of
  ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations 
 that move through four acts\; each sharing a story that takes the audience
  on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color\, emotion\, and momentum. 
  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps\, c
 risp footwork\, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's 
 2025 tour.\n\nPapadakis\, Czisny and Ward's presence elevates every phrase
 &mdash\;their power\, musical instinct\, and magnetic connection ignite th
 e audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: 
 athletic\, cinematic\, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 20
 26\, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance d
 ance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo\;THE SEAS
 ONS isn't just a show&mdash\;it's a pulse\, a spark\, a reminder that when
  blades meet music and movement meets heart\, the ice itself begins to sin
 g.&rdquo\; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be communit
 y events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI compa
 ny. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/
 cross overs\, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. C
 lasses will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth 
 and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and a
 dvance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chanc
 e for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast me
 mbers. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show\, regroup an
 d get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.

  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista

 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feel
 s like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way
 . His voice is raw and real\, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’
 s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest\, and that’s
  exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Am
 ericana\; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie\, blues lege
 nds like Howlin’ Wolf\,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe\, an
 d master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and c
 onnects audiences\, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren
 ’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s so
 ft and haunting\, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay wi
 th you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sou
 nd. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness\, conn
 ection\, love\, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band s
 how\, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOv
 er the years\, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless to
 uring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists 
 like Shakey Graves\, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\, Sarah Jarosz\, and Alic
 e O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock\, SXSW\, and High Si
 erra Music Festival\, but his focus has always been on making music that m
 eans something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending y
 ears on the road\, self-funding his albums\, and navigating the ups and do
 wns of life as an independent artist\, husband\, and father. But through i
 t all\, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music th
 at connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real\, that makes
  you stop and listen\, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

 myself for trying something new.”\n\n“I'm neither a writer nor a dance
 r\, but Loretta made it easy to put aside my inhibitions and let my emotio
 nal body lead the way… I recommend this class for anybody at all!”\n\n
 "It felt delicious to dive into my creative moving and language self with 
 others. For days after\, I felt both emptied and filled up creatively in w
 ays that I hadn’t felt in a long time."\n\n"I felt refreshed\, renewed\,
  and like I had processed some emotional blockages… The paths were opene
 d and the words just flowed."\n\nCome move and write with us! Visit www.Mo

DESCRIPTION:“If I was forced to categorize it\, I’d call it modern fol
 k. It’s powerful\, romantic\, and giddy. And the two are insanely infect
 ious together onstage\, like a musical and a personal love fest all at onc
 e.”  – Huffington Post  With more than a dozen albums and over a thous
 and shows between them\, Ty Greenstein and Ingrid Elizabeth of Mouths of B
 abes are no strangers to the contemporary folk music scene. For years\, th
 eir respective bands Girlyman and Coyote Grace captivated thousands of loy
 al fans as they criss-crossed the country\, rocked festival main stages\, 
 and toured with the likes of the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Now\, as M
 ouths of Babes\, Ty and Ingrid have distilled the very best of the songwri
 ting\, musicianship\, and humor of their previous groups into a new duo th
 at brings more style and depth than ever before.  Mouths of Babes recorded
  their highly anticipated first full-length album\, Brighter In the Dark a
 t Prairie Sun Studios in northern California last summer on the strength o
 f a wildly successful\, 800-backer\, $56\,000 Kickstarter campaign. Releas
 ed in January 2017\, the self-produced album contains twelve original song
 s with contrasting themes of light and dark\, tragedy and comedy\, persona
 l and political. Mixed by Stewart Lerman \\(Dar Williams\, Bob Dylan\\)\, 
 Brighter features guest appearances from Birds of Chicago\, Tania Elizabet
 h \\(The Avett Brothers\\)\, Mai Bloomfield \\(Jason Mraz\\) and others.  
 No Depression writes\, “Mouths of Babes could never have predicted how n
 ecessary Brighter In The Dark \\[would be\\] in a post-Trump world. The al
 bum title is fitting. We need music that shows people struggling against s
 ocial expectations\, that reminds us that we all have the resilience we ne
 ed to make it through.” Thinking Lyrically blog gives the album 9 stars 
 out of 10: "An eclectic arsenal of songs\, showcasing their knack for fusi
 ng blues\, folk\, and soul with poetic lyrics \\[and\\] great choruses...a
 n incredibly versatile record. One of my new favourite listens.”  The ke
 y to the Mouths of Babes magic is in the contrast\; the differences in bot
 h their songwriting and personal styles makes for an unusually satisfying 
 yin and yang. Of their live show\, the Chicago Tribune writes\, “They of
 fer unique counterpoints to one another…the laidback Ty\, nattily dresse
 d in a tie and crisp suit jacket\, has a rich\, lovely alto. Ingrid\, clad
  in a sultry pink satin mini-dress\, is a sassy chanteuse with a lilting s
 oprano. Trading jokes and sharing elegant harmonies\, the two women displa
 y an intuitive professional bond.” They easily switch off lead vocals an
 d play a wide array of instruments\, with Ty on acoustic and electric guit
 ars and foot percussion\, and Ingrid playing upright bass\, ukulele\, and 
 cajon.  Onstage\, Ty makes a quiet impression as a gifted lyricist\, talen
 ted multi-instrumentalist\, and magnetic presence. “The poignant honesty
  that Ty brings to \\[her\\] tunes gives them an emotional intensity that
 ’s as bracing as it is moving\,” says Relix Magazine.  The Americana G
 azette writes\, “Ty’s practice of extending metaphors out toward a pre
 cipice keeps an unpredictable edge to her songs. Most writers would stop a
 t the easy close. Ty jumps\, leaving much to the imagination\, to powerful
  effect.” Ingrid\, a natural performer\, easily commands audiences with 
 her larger-than-life sassiness and professional dancer’s grace. "With a 
 background in burlesque\, sex-education\, and good ol' American roots musi
 c\," writes Kithfolk\, "Ingrid Elizabeth brings a ton of charisma to her p
 erformances." Curve Magazine calls Ingrid “the fiery redheaded bassist..
 .the unabashed\, unapologetic woman who isn’t afraid to yell it all from
  the rooftops.”  Both Ingrid and Ty come from notable musical families\,
  and their influences \\(namely\, 60’s folk music and Motown\\) are deep
 ly embedded in Mouths of Babes’ sound. Ty’s father\, Ron Greenstein\, 
 is a member of the legendary folk harmony trio The Chad Mitchell Trio \\(w
 here John Denver got his start\\)\, while Ingrid’s uncle Tom Eyen wrote 
 the world-famous\, Tony-winning musical Dreamgirls.  MTV News writes: “T
 he songs Mouths of Babes writes and performs together fuse blues\, folk\, 
 and soul\, and the depth of emotion found in their lyrics is reminiscent o
 f all that’s moving about the Dreamgirls soundtrack.”  “Hands down t
 he best new music I've heard in years. It's damn near perfect. The instrum
 ental performances\, the arrangements\, the production\, the songwriting a
 nd singing…this is the kind of music that makes you glad to be alive. 
 ” – Michael Mullane\, Cafe Veritas Mouths of Babes is Ty Greenstein \\
 (Girlyman\\) & Ingrid Elizabeth \\(Coyote Grace\\). Equal parts celebratio
 n and blues. Folky\, soulful deliciousness. Get some.

 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista

 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga

DESCRIPTION:5x BLUES MUSIC AWARD WINNER\n\n2025 BMA WINNER "HORN PLAYER OF
  THE YEAR"\n\n2024 BMA WINNER "HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR"\n\n2022 BMA WINNER
  “CONTEMPORARY BLUES FEMALE ARTIST OF THE YEAR”\n\n2020 BMA WINNER “
 HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR!” \n\n2019 BMA WINNER “HORN PLAYER OF THE YEAR
 !” \n\n“There’s a young lady \\[Vanessa Collier\\] came onstage with
  me\, I forget where I was\, but she’s playing an alto saxophone\, and m
 an\, she was amazing.”\n\n Those are the words of Buddy Guy in an issue 
 of American Blues Scene\, describing an impromptu performance with Vanessa
  Collier on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise. If you haven’t been for
 tunate enough to meet Vanessa and witness one of her head-turning\, fiery\
 , and passionate performances\, you should definitely make sure you do. As
  a master musician and multi-instrumentalist\, Vanessa Collier\, weaves fu
 nk\, soul\, rock\, and blues into every powerful performance and she is do
 wnright impressive. With soulful vocals\, searing saxophone\, and witty so
 ngwriting\, Vanessa is blazing a trail\, racking up an impressive arsenal 
 of honours\, and has already singled herself out as an artist of distincti
 on and one we would all do well to watch.\n\nIt’s not simply the accolad
 es she has accumulated so far\, although they’ve been many -- two Blues 
 Music Awards for “Horn Player of the Year”\, and a third BMA for “Co
 ntemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”\, eight Blues Music Award No
 minations \\(BMAs\\)\, a Blues Blast Award nomination\, the Jammingest Pro
  Award bestowed by the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise\, First Place for l
 yrics in the International Songwriting Competition\, Best of 2014 Blues Br
 eaker on Dan Aykroyd’s BluesMobile -- it’s the fact that she has accum
 ulated all these honours even while her career is still in its infancy. A 
 2013 graduate of the prestigious Berklee College of Music\, she’s toured
  nationally and internationally\, released four critically acclaimed album
 s \\(2014’s Heart\, Soul & Saxophone\, 2017’s Meeting My Shadow\, and 
 2018’s Honey Up\, 2020’s Heart On The Line. Honey Up spent 9 weeks ato
 p the Billboard Blues Album Charts Top 15\, 3 months on the Living Blues C
 harts at \\#10 and \\#23\, and continues to be spun on Sirius XM’s B.B. 
 King’s Bluesville radio station! \n\nIt’s not surprising that the pres
 s has been quick to commend her efforts as well. Blues Blast Magazine affi
 rms\, “Vanessa Collier is a fresh face on the American blues scene\, and
  in addition to her soulful vocals\, she brings a mighty sax to the table.
 ..” Blues Music Magazine proclaims\, “Collier is a fresh face who come
 s to the blues stage carrying her reed instruments\, a dual degree from Be
 rklee College of Music in Boston\, a major label debut\, almost two years 
 of touring with Joe Louis Walker\, and a mature musical vision…Collier c
 ommands center stage with her vocals\, soloing\, and stage presence.” Mi
 dwest Record exclaims\, “This bluesy singing sax player knows how to bri
 ng the slinking funk to her captivating\, award winning sound that has ech
 oes in young Bonnie Raitt/Maria Muldaur vocal sounds…Killer stuff on eve
 ry level\, this sounds like one of the reasons you first became a music fa
 n. Killer stuff.” and AXS.Com declares that she “might as well go ahea
 d and add another shelf to her trophy case because clearly\, she’s going
  to need it. With a voice that often recalls that of blues-rock stalwart B
 onnie Raitt\, Collier turns up the heat...”\n\nHaving first picked up th
 e saxophone at the age of nine\, Collier embarked on her road to recogniti
 on at Berklee\, earning dual degrees in Performance and Music Production &
  Engineering. While still completing her degree\, Collier landed a positio
 n touring with Joe Louis Walker for a year and a half before Joe encourage
 d her to strike out on her own. And strike out she did.\n\nThese days\, Co
 llier spends much of her time on the road\, performing at some of the most
  prestigious music festivals in the world. Her talents have taken her to t
 he Blues Music Awards Show where\, in the words of the Blues Foundation\, 
 Vanessa “blew the doors off the Blues Music Awards!”\; Ottawa Blues Fe
 stival\, where she earned two front page newspaper photos and rave reviews
  after her foot stomping debut there\; twice on the Legendary Rhythm and B
 lues Cruise\, where she earned the Jammingest Pro Award and was a featured
  artist with Tommy Castro’s Blues Review\; Briggs Farm Festival\, where 
 she was the “most popular Briggs Farm act in 2017” \\(Elmore Magazine\
 \)\, and the list continues. \n\nVanessa has won 3 Blues Music Awards - tw
 o for “Horn Player of the Year” in 2019 and 2020 and one in 2022 for 
 “Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”!! She has been nominate
 d for eight Blues Music Awards since 2017\, which puts her in elite compan
 y with artists such as Beth Hart\, Samantha Fish\, Shemekia Copeland\, Rut
 hie Foster\, Trombone Shorty\, Al Basile\, and Jimmy Carpenter.\n\nAs for 
 Collier\, she says she’s happy performing on stages across the world\, h
 oping that she can make a difference with fans and followers along the way
 . “I am driven to do this because I find it a total form of expression a
 nd connection\,” she explains. “I love connecting with an audience and
  feeling their energy and I hope to inspire people to follow their dreams 
 and passions\, to find what brings them joy\, and then to pursue it dogged
 ly.” Vanessa also takes that message to young people as she runs clinics
  across the country and is active with Blues in the Schools programs. At a
  recent Blues in the School program\, Vanessa invited a stage full of elem
 entary and middle school aged kids up to dance around her while she perfor
 med a blues shuffle. Watching the joy on the faces of Vanessa\, the kids\,
  and everyone in the auditorium\, it is no wonder why Vanessa has become a
 we-inspiring to all who meet her. On top of talent and hard work\, Vanessa
  shares an incredible heart and a strong purpose. To borrow from the words
  of an article in Blues Blast Magazine\, “Vanessa is an important part o
 f the future of the blues\, and it would be cool to support her journey."

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:“… Enuff corporate noise in the ears of the youth … Time
  to spread the Truth.” \n\nWith a deep Reggae Influence the Nattali Rize
  band bring heavy beats & conscious rebel lyrics to a progressive electron
 ic\, roots\, reggae\, dub foundation. But this is more than genre labels\;
  The music\, message & intention trancends all that\, forget the borders a
 nd waters that divide us\, the movement is to ignite the great remembrance
  of who we are\, our collective power\, what we can be\, to break the ment
 al conditioning and find full freedom in this lifetime.\n\nThe Nattali Riz
 e project launched out of Jamaica into the US\, EU and beyond in 2014 with
  a strong run of captivating festival performances and national club shows
 . Now with tours alongside the likes of Michael Franti and Spearhead\, Kat
 chafire\, Third World\, J-Boog\, Julian Marley\, Tribal Seeds and more und
 er their belt\, the worldwide movement is ever rizing!\n\nThis is a global
  mash up of raw energy and vibe that together has been rocking stages sinc
 e the band first burst onto the scene in 2015.\n\nAsk Nattali where she co
 mes from\, she’ll tell you “All Directions”\, with no fixed address\
 , Nattali is now based where the music takes her\, Nattali Rize claims not
  to belong to any nation state\, but to the ever-evolving community of awa
 kening consciousness. The global mission - to uplift\, unify consciousness
  & Rize together\n\n“Nattali is a bright light in the world with a visio
 n that extends beyond the stage.”- Michael Franti \\(Spearhead\\)\n\nNat
 tali Rize is recognised globally for her unwavering commitment to using he
 r voice and music for the global shift toward Full Freedom and the movemen
 t of Truth and Justice over the systemic exploitation of the people and ou
 r planet. \n\n."Our intention with our music is to ignite that memory in o
 urselves of our individual and collective power to live life to the fulles
 t and recognize our selves and each other as evolving beings of light. A r
 eality of Full Freedom is a possibility on this earth and in these times. 
 We use music to sound frequencies infused with this idea\, and to resonate
  at a higher level than what is currently being permeated across current w
 orld culture. People are powerful\; we want them to reclaim that power and
  no longer be servants to a system that has never\, and will never\, serve
  them to their fullest potential. As such\, our frequency in this system i
 s a rebel …  Rebel Music\, Rebel Frequencies we deal with!” - Nattali 
 Rize.\n\nThe debut album Rebel Frequency\, released in May 2018 is availab
 le on all platforms now.\n\nDecember 2018 also sees the release of the off
 icial merchandise through the bands brand Rize Nation Wear.\n\n“One of t
 he nation’s most refreshing voices” - Rolling Stone.\n\n“INFECTIOUS!
