    "description": "Embroidered Valentine Botanicals Workshop at Sonoma Botanical Garden invites guests to explore the Victorian-era tradition of floriography, the language of flowers through a creative, hands-on embroidery experience. Led by artist and maker Robert Mahar, this workshop blends history, design, and needlework as participants learn core embroidery basics and essential stitches while embellishing a custom-printed 18×27” linen-cotton canvas featuring restored vintage floral illustrations associated with love and romance.    The artwork is sourced from an 1896 botanical volume and paired with charming typography, creating a unique, free-form sampler. Attendees will begin their projects in class and leave with the skills to finish at home, resulting in a piece that can be displayed as wall art or used as a tea towel. .

Tom’s hard rock spin on power-pop has drawn comparisons to acts of the 60’s and 70’s (think T Rex meets MC5) merging clever lyrics, catchy melodies, and stunning guitar work. With dynamic stagecraft and top-tier musicianship of rhythm section Alex Dang-Lozano (drums) and Will Durkee (bass), Tom Relling Band consistently delivers full-tilt live performances, uplifting and astounding audiences with high energy guitar-based rock n’roll. New LP “Peace In Love” is out now on Shaky Records. \nAll views expressed in this broadcast are those of the artist.\n\nSource: Luther Burbank Center",

Gurney. \nThe production will reprise the performances of Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, CEO of YWCA Sonoma County, as Melissa Gardner, and former Press Democrat columnist Chris Smith as Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. The longtime Sonoma County friends first appeared in Love Letters in 2016. \nTicket sales for the play will raise much-needed funds for YWCA’s vital and singular domestic violence programs serving local families who find themselves in danger in their homes – the place we should all feel safest. For 50 years, YWCA Sonoma County has been the county’s answer to the need by families for refuge, advocacy, and support with domestic violence. \nLove Letters is based on the lifelong, intimate correspondence of these two characters whose entire story unfolds through written words exchanged in the form of letters. In a relationship spanning 50 years, their letters contain their hopes and ambitions, dreams and disappointments, victories and defeats throughout their separate lives. \nAfter debuting in 1988, Love Letters quickly moved to both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. Over the years, the roles were performed by notable actors such as Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow, Carol Burnett with Dennehy, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen, as well as Angelica Huston and Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. \nAccording to Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, “In addition to the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, people deserve respect, dignity and safety to conduct productive lives and care for their children. YWCA is honored to be a leader in the efforts to address needs so many people take for granted.”  \nChris Smith, who retired from the PD in 2021 but still contributes to the newspaper on occasion, said, “Bringing the power of the written word and the lost art of letter writing together with support for YWCA Sonoma County is a winning combination for me.” \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Her unique character antics and viral videos have racked up millions of views across social media and garnered fans across the country (and the country clubs). In 2022, she released the original song “Mama Needs a Claw.” \n\n\nVIP Add-On Option: \n\nPost Event Meet & Greet\n\n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

She has recorded more than 25 albums and has lent her talents to countless fellow artists’ recordings. In recognition of her remarkable career, Harris was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. \nHarris is one of the most admired and influential women in music. She has recorded with such diverse artists as Linda Ronstadt, Daniel Lanois, Bob Dylan, Mark Knopfler, Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Roy Orbison, Ryan Adams, Beck, Elvis Costello, Johnny Cash, Lucinda Williams, Lyle Lovett and Rodney Crowell. Few artists have achieved such honesty or have revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career, Harris continues to share the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Willman is best known as the star and creator of Netflix’s Magic for Humans and Magic Prank Show, where his signature mix of mind-blowing magic and relatable humor has made him a streaming favorite, a viral hit (1 billion views and counting), and a fan favorite for families, comedy lovers, and skeptics alike. \nHe’s appeared on The Tonight Show, The Today Show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, and Conan, and he was recently named “Stage Magician of the Year” by the Magic Castle. He’s performed at the White House, packed theaters across the country, and managed to make grown adults openly weep over a card trick. But the live show? That’s where the real magic happens. \nOne for the Ages is Justin’s biggest tour to date, featuring brand-new material and more. It’s an interactive, laugh-filled, sleight-of-mind experience that’s smart, silly, and astonishing. And yes, it’s the kind of show you can bring your kids, your date, or your dad to. All ages. All generations. All-new. \nThis is one for the ages! \n\n\nVIP Ticket to include: \n\nBest available seating\nPoster\nPost-show Meet & Greet with Justin Willman\n\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

Hosting the night is KJ Danny D (Danny Duclos)—one of the most popular and in-demand karaoke hosts around. We’re genuinely stoked to have him bringing his style, energy, and crowd-moving presence to Downtown Santa Rosa.\n\nThis isn’t sleepy bar karaoke. Danny brings a fresh, high-energy approach that turns singing into a full-on late-night experience. Big stage, great sound, packed room, and the kind of momentum that keeps people singing well past closing time.\n\nMain showroom  Starts 9pm (after Open Mic)  No cover  Downtown Santa Rosa\n\nCheck out **www.barrelprooflounge.com** for all sorts of good times ahead.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "What if Mozart’s music could surprise you with new colors you didn’t know you were missing? This program shines a spotlight on two of his favorite voices: the basset horn and the basset clarinet. Deeper, warmer, and more velvety than their modern descendants, these instruments were prized in Mozart’s time for their ability to sing, sigh, and whisper with uncanny intimacy.\n\nThe program begins with a charming quintet by Mozart’s contemporary Johann Backofen, whose writing shows off the basset horn’s mellow glow and conversational wit. Mozart’s youthful “Milanese” string quartet follows, sparkling with elegance and invention. The program culminates in Mozart’s beloved clarinet quintet, a work of timeless beauty, virtuosity, and ingenuity performed here on a replica of the original basset clarinet Mozart had in mind. Performed on period instruments, this concert offers a chance to hear familiar music scrubbed clean—lighter, more transparent, and irresistibly alive.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

An intimate group trip, you’ll start each day from the boutique Hotel Healdsburg in the center of our charming town and every moment is personally curated by us. We’ll take you to the world-renowned regions of Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Along the way, you’ll enjoy private winery visits to the uber-luxury Robert Young Winery, the site of one of our very first dates, and a winery that Eric used to manage, the legendary Buena Vista Winery. We’ll visit the most sought after cult brewery in the world, the Russian River Brewing Co \\(yes, this is beer in Sonoma as well… trust us … we know our alcohol\\).\n\nOh, you will eat… and eat very well at my favorite Sonoma restaurants including dinner at The Dry Creek Kitchen, and a private lunch that may include more lobster than you’ve ever seen in one place, and of course, dinner at the most popular restaurant in Healdsburg, The Matheson. You’ll understand why when you visit!\n\nWe love to eat and drink, but what sets our Adventures apart is the music… a truly exclusive experience you won’t find anywhere else. I will host intimate private concerts with my friends and guest musicians, set in stunning locations across picturesque Sonoma. Some past artists have included Vincent Ingala, Richard Elliot, Peter White and Rick Braun.\n\nAnd, if you’re interested in extending your stay with me, there is an optional one-day  extension add-on that has become the signature day of our domestic Adventures, where you will experience the very finest Sonoma has to offer.\n\nI can’t wait to welcome you into this extraordinary place, a little slice of heaven we call home!\n\nCheers!

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We look forward to sharing this special place with you, where every moment is part of the journey. \n\nMAKE SURE TO VISIT OUR VENUE INFORMATION PAGE – HERE\n\nVENUE MAP\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "If you listen to just a few tracks from his latest album, you might think Creed Fisher was born with a guitar in his hand. One after another his songs remain relevant today, yet steeped with tradition classics that everyone else already knows and you don’t want to miss. Clearly he’s sharing his own stories, with experiences that range from great victories to deep battle scars. \n\nFisher hails from Odessa, TX,  where his family’s roots trace back to his granddad, who was highly involved in the oil game back in the fifties. However, Fisher took on a different passion when he started playing football at the age of 10, which eventually led to the Minor Leagues for 9 years. \n\nBut, as his football career came to a close, Fisher also saw his marriage of twelve years come to an end. It was at this point he decided to do some serious “soul searching”. Fisher tells us that the music simply “found him” during this time. He picked up a guitar in 2010 and never let it go; and after touring tirelessly for 4 years, Fisher moved from West Texas to a small town outside of San Antonio, TX, where he put together a new band, and picked up where he left off.\n\nFisher’s second album \"Ain't Scared To Bleed\" went Top 30 on the ITunes Country charts and continues to be embraced by fans all around the world. When it came to his 3rd album \"Rednecks Like Us\" it was reviewed by Country Music People magazine and got 4 out of 5 stars. Here is what they had to say...\n\n“Creed Fisher sings and writes with the confidence and authority of someone who has been at it for a hell of a lot longer than 6 years. He is at his strongest on the ballads, but tackles the ‘angry redneck’ stuff just as well. There’s the odd moment when it can all get a bit crashy and loud for me, but I’d say the same about Hank Jr. All things considered, this is very impressive indeed and I’d like to see Creed Fisher go far.\n\nFriends and fans alike anxiously await Creed Fisher’s release of his 4th album. There is no denying that Fisher is truly speaking from passion when it comes to his music. Fisher is the guy you meet that you feel like you’ve known all your life and his music feels like the songs you’ve been singing since you first discovered music.

No other cars, just the headlights on the blacktop. Above, the cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky….\n\nHusbands Don and Rodney have lived a good long life. Together they’ve experienced the highest highs of love and family, and lows so low that they felt like the end of the world.\n\nNow, the world is ending for real. A rogue black hole is coming for Earth and in a month everything and everyone they’ve ever known will be gone.\n\nSuddenly, after 40 years together, Don and Rodney are out of time. They’re in a race against the clock to make it from Maine to Washington State to take care of some unfinished business before it’s all over.\n\nOn the road they meet those who refuse to believe death is coming and those who rush to meet it. But there are also people living their final days as best they know how—impromptu weddings, bright burning bonfires, shared meals, and new friends.\n\nAnd as the black hole draws near, among ball lightning and under a cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky, Don and Rodney will look back on their lives and ask if their best was good enough.\n\nIs it enough to burn bright if nothing comes from the ashes?\n\nAuthor: TJ KLUNE \\(he/him\\) is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling, Lambda Literary Award-winning author of The House in the Cerulean Sea, Under the Whispering Door, In the Lives of Puppets, the Green Creek Series for adults, the Extraordinaries Series for teens, and more.

Tell us why you can’t miss this special afternoon by emailing jmadsen@copperbook.com\n\n**A heart-wrenching standalone novel by #1 *New York Times* bestselling author TJ Klune,*We Burned So Bright* follows an elder gay couple on an end-of-the-world road-trip.**\n\n*The road stretched out before them. No other cars, just the headlights on the blacktop. Above, the cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky….*\n\nHusbands Don and Rodney have lived a good long life. Together they’ve experienced the highest highs of love and family, and lows so low that they felt like the end of the world.\n\nNow, the world is ending for real. A rogue black hole is coming for Earth and in a month everything and everyone they’ve ever known will be gone.\n\nSuddenly, after 40 years together, Don and Rodney are out of time. They’re in a race against the clock to make it from Maine to Washington State to take care of some unfinished business before it’s all over.\n\nOn the road they meet those who refuse to believe death is coming and those who rush to meet it. But there are also people living their final days as best they know how—impromptu weddings, bright burning bonfires, shared meals, and new friends.\n\nAnd as the black hole draws near, among ball lightning and under a cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky, Don and Rodney will look back on their lives and ask if their best was good enough.\n\nIs it enough to burn bright if nothing comes from the ashes?\n\n**Author: TJ KLUNE** (he/him) is the *New York Times* and *USA Today* bestselling, Lambda Literary Award-winning author of *The House in the Cerulean Sea*, *Under the Whispering Door*, *In the Lives of Puppets*, the Green Creek Series for adults, the Extraordinaries Series for teens, and more.

A respected local Taiko artist, David has appeared in films such as Return of the Jedi and performed at renowned venues including Zellerbach Hall and Carnegie Hall. The Taiko performance is further enriched by Heidi Varian, a highly regarded Taiko artist and author of The Way of Taiko. Heidi's deep understanding of Taiko's cultural significance and her mastery of the art form adds a special layer to the performance, creating an unforgettable experience for the audience.

    "description": "Welcome to my hometown of Healdsburg… in the heart of Sonoma wine country, a town so special that Condé Nast named it one of the finest cities in the country.\n\nI invite you into our world… where our friendships with winemakers, chefs, and musicians will create an unforgettable Adventure just for you. An intimate group trip, you’ll start each day from the boutique Hotel Healdsburg in the center of our charming town and every moment is personally curated by us. We’ll take you to the world-renowned regions of Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Along the way, you’ll enjoy private winery visits to the uber-luxury Robert Young Winery, the site of one of our very first dates, and a winery that Eric used to manage, the legendary Buena Vista Winery. We’ll visit the most sought after cult brewery in the world, the Russian River Brewing Co \\(yes, this is beer in Sonoma as well… trust us … we know our alcohol\\).\n\nOh, you will eat… and eat very well at my favorite Sonoma restaurants including dinner at The Dry Creek Kitchen, and a private lunch that may include more lobster than you’ve ever seen in one place, and of course, dinner at the most popular restaurant in Healdsburg, The Matheson. You’ll understand why when you visit!\n\nWe love to eat and drink, but what sets our Adventures apart is the music… a truly exclusive experience you won’t find anywhere else. I will host intimate private concerts with my friends and guest musicians, set in stunning locations across picturesque Sonoma. Some past artists have included Vincent Ingala, Richard Elliot, Peter White and Rick Braun.\n\nAnd, if you’re interested in extending your stay with me, there is an optional one-day  extension add-on that has become the signature day of our domestic Adventures, where you will experience the very finest Sonoma has to offer.\n\nI can’t wait to welcome you into this extraordinary place, a little slice of heaven we call home!\n\nCheers! Mindi 🎶 \\+ Eric 🍷\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Of the many marks of genius associated with rock n’ roll greatness, the knack for surrounding oneself with transformational talent looms especially large, with The Rolling Stones being perhaps the most notable example. Jeffrey Halford treads a poetic rootsy path on his latest release, SOUL CRUSADE, combining a bulletproof collection of songs inspired by gospel, folk, soul, and blues, with a formidable roster of musical contributors. The result is one of Halford’s most approachable and easy-grooving.\n\nHis latest album release, SOUL CRUSADE, is the follow-up to the critically acclaimed record WEST TOWARDS SOUTH. The album came out in Europe on Continental Song City, debuted in September at \\#2, and then undisputedly reached \\#1 in October 2022 and stayed in the chart for four months. \n\nJEFFREY HALFORD & THE HEALERS are gearing up for their eighth European tour in September and October 2025, bringing their signature blend of raw rock ‘n’ roll, country, and soul back to the stage. But this tour isn’t just another run—it marks the 25th anniversary of KEROSENE, the album \\(release date Friday, August 29th, 2025\\) that put Halford on the map as a true Americana troubadour.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

This two-hour, gentle guided kayak tour launches from The Floathouse Petaluma and explores the river that once served as the region's \"saltwater highway.\" Long before roads and railways, the Petaluma River powered San Francisco, the Gold Rush miners, and even global markets with the produce from local farms and industries, supplying everything from eggs to overalls.\n\nDesigned and led by a Petaluman, actor and former history teacher this entertaining and enlightening tour brings history to life through storytelling enhanced by costumed actors on shore. You'll hear fascinating stories from the perspectives of long-ago Petalumans—young workers, entrepreneurs, and colorful characters whose daily lives revolved around the river.\n\nPaddle in stable sit-on-top kayaks through and beyond Petaluma's charming downtown, while gaining a deeper appreciation for how this tidal waterway shaped the city and the region. Visitors are often surprised by how much they learn—and many come back with friends.\n\n$75 per person, all-inclusive. No paddling experience necessary. All equipment provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

After graduating high school, Callie began playing and performing solo, as well as in local and bay area bands of different genres. She’s played blues with Eric Lindell and the Reds, funky soul with Phatty, and jazz/swing with Savoy Swingers along with many other various projects. Callie has taken turns throughout her career as a keyboardist, guitarist, writer, and lead/backing vocalist, and she’s currently a member of the dynamic Sonoma County funk rock band Burrows and Dilbeck, having joined in 2010 as part of the former band Frobeck. Over time, she’s had the honor of opening for acts such as Bootsy Collins, Elvin Bishop, Huey Lewis and The News, War, Ozomatli, Bill Champlin, Booker T, and the B52s. Callie continues to perform frequently as an acoustic solo artist, focusing on developing a core audience and a buzz for her original material.

    "description": "**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Spend time with yourself. Rest. And then… the shifts. Witness something rare and powerful: a room of strangers becoming vulnerable, intimate, and safe. With guidance and support, you'll feel seen, held, and loved, and from that place, deep re-patterning becomes possible. You'll leave with: ✨ Awakened intuition and confidence to know your path, and the courage to follow it ✨ A proven approach to move through fear so you can share your gifts ✨ Your wild woman warrior ignited-calling in creativity, sensuality, and purpose\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

With extra water beneath us, we’re able to glide into calm, lush stretches of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Air: Mental Alchemy Shadow Work\n\nTea &amp; Tarot &bull; The Alchemy of Thought\n\nSunday, May 17\n\nAir is the realm of the mind &mdash; language, memory, belief, perception, and meaning. It shapes how we interpret reality and how reality responds to us. In this Air-themed Tea &amp; Tarot gathering, we enter the subtle territory of mental shadow work: the unconscious thought forms, internalized voices, and belief systems that quietly influence our choices, communication, and sense of self.\n\nMental shadow is not simply &ldquo;negative thinking.&rdquo; It includes inherited narratives, protective strategies of the psyche, internalized authority, and unexamined assumptions that once served a purpose but now restrict growth. Through tarot, we gently bring these patterns into conscious awareness, where they can be met with discernment rather than suppression.\n\nThis is not a therapeutic intervention, nor is it predictive. It is a sacred inquiry into how the mind constructs meaning &mdash; and how awareness restores agency.\n\nWhat We'll Explore\n\n    &bull;    The origins of recurring thought loops and mental habits\n\n    &bull;    Internalized voices from family, culture, or past experiences\n\n    &bull;    How fear, control, or avoidance shape perception\n\n    &bull;    Where clarity, truth, or expression is being unconsciously restrained\n\n    &bull;    The difference between intuition, thought, and conditioned belief\n\nAir teaches us that thought is creative &mdash; but not all thoughts are true. When we learn to listen beneath the noise of the mind, we reclaim authorship of our inner world and restore integrity to our voice.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "**Truth or Spin? The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Founded in 2016 by classical pianist Hunter Noack, IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild is a 501\\(c\\)\\(3\\) nonprofit outdoor concert series where America's most stunning landscapes replace the traditional concert hall. A 9-foot Steinway grand piano travels on a flatbed trailer to State and National Parks, urban greenspaces, working ranches, farms, and historical sites for classical music concerts that connect people with each landscape. To meet the acoustical challenges of performing in the wild, music is transmitted to concert-goers via wireless headphones. No longer confined to seats, audiences explore the landscape, wander through secret glens, lie in sunny meadows, and roam old growth forests. IN A LANDSCAPE has presented 275 concerts in Oregon, Washington, Montana, Idaho, New York, Utah, Wyoming, and California to over 55,000 people. Folks travel from near and far. Local ranchers, loggers, and farmers gather with visiting city dwellers and tourists from beyond.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

The compositions by Jovino, Hermeto Pascoal, and Marcos Valle will serve as points of departure for inspired musical conversations among the three extraordinary players. The music will range from the lyrical to the deep grooves this trio can generate.  Jovino’s personal style is a creative blend of energetic harmonies, telepathic improvisation, lyrical melodies and great ensemble playing, always inspired and informed by the colorful richness of Brazilian music. His compositions include samba, choro, baião, xote, forró, marcha and many more styles, rooted in centuries-old musical tradition while pointing to new and adventurous harmonic languages.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Over the course of crafting a 29-album catalog and architecting 40 Billboard \\#1 singles as a keyboardist, songwriter and producer, Brian Culbertson has charted his own unique course in music. Label him jazz and he makes a funk record. Call him an R&B artist and he drops an acoustic jazz trio collection. Brand him pop and he creates a 32-minute New Age opus. And you’d be hard pressed to name another instrumentalist of his ilk who can mount an elaborately designed concert production that will keep him on the road for three consecutive months. \n\nCulbertson burst onto the scene in 1994 with a chart-topping album that he recorded in his college apartment featuring keyboard-led contemporary jazz tracks. “Long Night Out” landed him a lengthy record deal and signaled that a star was born. Flash forward to present day, Culbertson has been going back and listening more and more to music that inspired him as a young musician such as David Sanborn, The Brecker Bros, Chick Corea, Al Jarreau, Pat Metheny, and others in the jazz fusion world.  \n\n“It instantly brought me back to the days of ‘no rules’ and the pure joy of music, something that I think a lot of albums today are lacking. With that said, I set out to write and produce a new album that would try to capture a little bit of that late 70’s and early 80’s spirit of music exploration, along with using only live musicians and real instruments.  Similar in style to “Another Long Night Out”,\n\n“Day Trip” is the daytime version!” said Culbertson. \n\nPossessing style, panache, and a savvy business mind capable of moving the needle in music and beyond, Culbertson founded and curates the annual Napa Valley, New Orleans, and Chicago Jazz Getaways, which have attracted guests from all over the globe to experience his premier events. \n\nWhether you’re listening to music from “Day Trip” on record or live in concert, you’re hearing an eclectic, entertaining and engaging set from an artist at the peak of his power.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Callie Watts is a singer/songwriter from Northern California who was raised on classical music, The Beatles and The Beach Boys before discovering Joni Mitchell, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Carole King, and all the great writers of the ’60s and 70’s who have influenced her sound and writing style. After graduating high school, Callie began playing and performing solo, as well as in local and bay area bands of different genres. She’s played blues with Eric Lindell and the Reds, funky soul with Phatty, and jazz/swing with Savoy Swingers along with many other various projects. Callie has taken turns throughout her career as a keyboardist, guitarist, writer, and lead/backing vocalist, and she’s currently a member of the dynamic Sonoma County funk rock band Burrows and Dilbeck, having joined in 2010 as part of the former band Frobeck. Over time, she’s had the honor of opening for acts such as Bootsy Collins, Elvin Bishop, Huey Lewis and The News, War, Ozomatli, Bill Champlin, Booker T, and the B52s. Callie continues to perform frequently as an acoustic solo artist, focusing on developing a core audience and a buzz for her original material. Come hang out and listen at venues such as Aroma Roasters, Rincon Valley Tap Room and Bottle Shop, and Hopmonk Tavern.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "When the tide is high, the Petaluma River opens into a quieter, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew for a gentle, guided paddle upstream, timed to higher tides that allow access beyond the downtown channel and into a tranquil tidal slough. With extra water beneath us, we’re able to glide into calm, lush stretches of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

This two-hour, gentle guided kayak tour launches from The Floathouse Petaluma and explores the river that once served as the region's \"saltwater highway.\" Long before roads and railways, the Petaluma River powered San Francisco, the Gold Rush miners, and even global markets with the produce from local farms and industries, supplying everything from eggs to overalls.\n\nDesigned and led by a Petaluman, actor and former history teacher this entertaining and enlightening tour brings history to life through storytelling enhanced by costumed actors on shore. You'll hear fascinating stories from the perspectives of long-ago Petalumans—young workers, entrepreneurs, and colorful characters whose daily lives revolved around the river.\n\nPaddle in stable sit-on-top kayaks through and beyond Petaluma's charming downtown, while gaining a deeper appreciation for how this tidal waterway shaped the city and the region. Visitors are often surprised by how much they learn—and many come back with friends.\n\n$75 per person, all-inclusive. No paddling experience necessary.

We’re genuinely stoked to have him bringing his style, energy, and crowd-moving presence to Downtown Santa Rosa.\n\nThis isn’t sleepy bar karaoke. Danny brings a fresh, high-energy approach that turns singing into a full-on late-night experience. Big stage, great sound, packed room, and the kind of momentum that keeps people singing well past closing time.\n\nMain showroom  Starts 9pm (after Open Mic)  No cover  Downtown Santa Rosa\n\nCheck out **www.barrelprooflounge.com** for all sorts of good times ahead.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Playful. Peaceful. Spend your evening under the full moon—on the water.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Zara McDonald Bio Biologist, entrepreneur and cross-sector consultant Zara McDonald is the founder and president of Felidae Conservation Fund, a global conservation organization conducting innovative research on wild felid species in the Bay Area and in targeted regions across the globe. Zara has led multiple startup ventures in technology, biotechnology, healthcare and private equity. She formed Felidae in 2006 after a transformative encounter on a Bay Area trail with a mountain lion. The benign encounter compelled her to question the prevailing narrative of the dangerous predator, leading to further questions about how wild felids influence ecosystems and biodiversity, especially at the urban-wildland interface, and how we can succeed at co-existence. She has worked throughout the world researching snow leopards, tigers, cheetahs, leopards, and multiple lesser known small cat species in Asia, Africa and South America. Zara is also a former competitive marathoner and ultra-runner, as well as a longtime insight meditation practitioner, an experienced yoga teacher, and biohacking and health coach.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Just steps from the heart of the Vallejo Art Walk, this monthly series invites you to discover bold new sounds in a setting made for connection—where the lights are low, the cocktails are strong, and the music runs deep.\n\nCome early for the art, stay late for the music.

This two-hour, gentle guided kayak tour launches from The Floathouse Petaluma and explores the river that once served as the region's \"saltwater highway.\" Long before roads and railways, the Petaluma River powered San Francisco, the Gold Rush miners, and even global markets with the produce from local farms and industries, supplying everything from eggs to overalls.\n\nDesigned and led by a Petaluman, actor and former history teacher this entertaining and enlightening tour brings history to life through storytelling enhanced by costumed actors on shore. You'll hear fascinating stories from the perspectives of long-ago Petalumans—young workers, entrepreneurs, and colorful characters whose daily lives revolved around the river.\n\nPaddle in stable sit-on-top kayaks through and beyond Petaluma's charming downtown, while gaining a deeper appreciation for how this tidal waterway shaped the city and the region. Visitors are often surprised by how much they learn—and many come back with friends.\n\n$75 per person, all-inclusive. No paddling experience necessary. All equipment provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

After graduating high school, Callie began playing and performing solo, as well as in local and bay area bands of different genres. She’s played blues with Eric Lindell and the Reds, funky soul with Phatty, and jazz/swing with Savoy Swingers along with many other various projects. Callie has taken turns throughout her career as a keyboardist, guitarist, writer, and lead/backing vocalist, and she’s currently a member of the dynamic Sonoma County funk rock band Burrows and Dilbeck, having joined in 2010 as part of the former band Frobeck. Over time, she’s had the honor of opening for acts such as Bootsy Collins, Elvin Bishop, Huey Lewis and The News, War, Ozomatli, Bill Champlin, Booker T, and the B52s. Callie continues to perform frequently as an acoustic solo artist, focusing on developing a core audience and a buzz for her original material.

The conservation dinner series is complimentary to all dinner guests.

About Susan Lutter:    Putting passion for gorillas to work Friends‘ founder Susan Lutter first visited Ape Action Africa in 2007, with the objective of seeing first-hand the work being done to save the endangered gorillas of Cameroon. \"I expected to be awed by the animals - and they are amazing - but I was simply overwhelmed by the talent and dedication of the people who are changing their lives for the better.\" She returned home to California, committed to using her business background to help raise awareness and support for the sanctuary. In the decade since that first visit, Susan has reached out to partners who have provided a wide range of funding and materials for the animals, the staff and the communities. \"It is critical to rescue and rehabilitate the orphaned primates, but it is our human behavior that has to change in order to save them in the long run. Ape Action's work with their neighboring communities is respectful and unflagging, and it is working.\" Friends of Ape Action Africa raises no funds for itself. Any and all work is done at the personal expense of its volunteers, and all revenue raised through various activities is sent straight to Ape Action Africa \\(via their US 501\\(c\\)\\(3\\) charity\\).\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "When the tide is high, the Petaluma River opens into a quieter, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew at their central downtown dock for a gentle, guided paddle upstream, timed to higher tides that allow access beyond the downtown channel and into a tranquil tidal slough. With extra water beneath us, we’re able to glide into calm, lush stretches of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know how to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12\\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(required!\\): Monthly \\(12\\), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Guided meditations, readings, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\+ monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\nQ&As: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Conservation Dinner Series: Bill Leikam \"The Fox Guy\" of  Urban Wildlife Research Project joins us in the elephant room after dinner to give a talk about grey foxes. The conservation dinner series is complimentary to all dinner guests. If you want to attend this presentation, please call our reservations team at \\(707\\) 566-3667 or \\(800\\) 616-2695 and they can book it for you. Dinner starts at 7:00 PM. About the Speaker    Science has been a fundamental part of Bill's life starting when he was just a teenager. In the 1970s, he conducted original research into the nature of consciousness that led to being a member in 1981 as one of an 18 member Scientific Delegation to the People's Republic of China where he presented his research on alternate modes of healing. During the 1980s, he spoke at conferences across the country both on consciousness and the psychology and neurophysiology of boredom. As of 2018, nine years ago, Bill began documenting, photographing and studying the behavior of the gray fox, something that has never before been done in such a comprehensive way. This study resulted in the development of the Urban Wildlife Research Project. He introduced his work to videographer and naturalist Greg Kerekes and welcomed him on board to join in with the research. They are dedicated to developing viable habitat and connectivity corridors for the gray fox and other wildlife living to the east of Highway 101 and the shore of the San Francisco Bay. Their work has attracted a good deal of attention by the press. They give highly acclaimed presentations about their work to corporate, private, and an array of wildlife organizations. Bill is also known as the Fox Guy. Organizations with which we are involved and have partnered with: National Wildlife Federation, Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge, Pathways for Wildlife, and CuriOdyssey at Coyote Point They are presently engaged with the Midpeninsula Open Space and Peninsula Open Space Trust \\(POST\\), both of which they have consulted with over the past two years. Additionally, Bill is an associate board member of the Guadalupe - Coyote Resource Conservation District \\(GCRCD\\) that covers a very large section of the Diablo Mountain Range on the eastern side of Silicon Valley and the Santa Cruz Mountains on the western side of the valley. The GCRCD is involved in habitat development, creek and river restoration, salmon and steelhead protection, watershed issues throughout the GCRCD's jurisdiction, planning with biodiversity at the center of all projects, working with farmers and ranchers to improve practices, protection of endangered species is just the overview of their work. Bill aka the Fox Guy said, \"I grew up on the banks of the Corralitos Creek, a wild creek flowing from the Santa Cruz Mountains, down the western slopes, and through our backyard. This initiated my love of creeks, fish, wildlife, and the pace, the rhythm of the seasons.\"\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

As twilight fades, we’ll head out together in Hobie pedal kayaks for a relaxed, guided glide that turns nighttime into playtime.\n\nThese pedal-powered kayaks make the journey smooth and easy, even if there’s a breeze or moving tide. We’ll cruise about a mile and a half downriver to the perfect moonrise vantage point, where calm water, wide skies, and glowing reflections set the scene.\n\nThis is a social, feel-good outdoor experience designed for anyone looking for something a little different to do after dark—part nature, part adventure, part pure vibe.\n\n**$60 per person includes everything:** • Hobie pedal kayak • PFD and safety lights • Experienced local guide • A memorable, moonlit river experience\n\n✨ Easy. Playful. Peaceful. Spend your evening under the full moon—on the water.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Genealogy Society of Vallejo-Benicia&'s August speaker is Candice Buchannan. Her topic is \"The Genealogy of a House\". Candice Buchanan is a reference librarian at the Library of Congress, specializing in local history and genealogy. As a teenager in search of a haunted mausoleum she discovered her ancestors' tombstones, launching a lifelong determination to identify past generations. Buchanan is a board-certified genealogist with a master's in public history from Duquesne University. Prior to joining the Library, she worked as a genealogist and archivist for Memory Medallion Inc., Genealogists.com and the Greene County, Pennsylvania, Orphans' Court. Viewing the past through the lens of family or local history can create a bond between the present day researcher and their ancestors or the past residents of their communities. That bond enables the distant events of national history to be seen from a more personal, memorable, and tangible perspective GSVB Members will automatically receive a Zoom invitation that will be sent out a couple of days before the meeting. Non-Members: If you are interested in attending, please send an e-mail to  GSVBzoom@gmail.com to request a Zoom invitation. The Zoom meeting time is at 1:30 pm Pacific Time. The event is FREE. All are welcome.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Formed by multi-talented musician and producer Leonid Vorobyev, the group features elite vocalists and instrumentalists from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, and beyond, all united by a shared passion for celebrating this iconic era of music. \nOriginally conceived as a studio project in Moscow, Leonid & Friends skyrocketed to international fame when their note-perfect video covers went viral online, earning praise from members of Chicago themselves. What began as a YouTube phenomenon has since evolved into a world-class touring act, captivating audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. \nWith more than 500 million combined video views, multiple sold-out U.S. tours, and a devoted global fanbase, the band is beloved worldwide for honoring the classics, while expanding far beyond them \n\n\nAfter-show Meet & Greet\nMeet & Greet is a wonderful opportunity for fans to meet and interact with Leonid & Friends. Quantity is limited at each show. Shortly after the concert, attendees with a M&G wristband will be allowed to meet the band, have a group photo taken, and the opportunity to chat with band members and have merchandise or memorabilia signed.\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.
