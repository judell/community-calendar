Think winter-morning-on-the-Left-Bank energy… just on the Plaza and with better books! \nDoors open at 9:00am, giving you time to linger, sip, and settle in before heading upstairs for the 10:00am event. \nJoin us for a reading and curated discussion followed by an audience Q&A and post event book signing with photo opportunities. \nThis is a ticketed event, each ticket package includes a signed copy of Paula’s new book Skylark. Signed copies of Rebecca’s beautiful gift book Paris Every Day will also be available for purchase during the ticket registration process and on-site at the event. \nA perfect gathering for Francophiles, book lovers, and anyone ready for a little everyday joie de vivre with their favorite people! \nAbout Skylark: \nThe New York Times bestselling author of The Paris Wife weaves a mesmerizing tale of Paris above and below—where a woman’s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 intertwines with a doctor’s dangerous mission during the German occupation in the 1940s, revealing a story of courage and resistance that transcends time. \n1664: Alouette Voland is the daughter of a master dyer at the famed Gobelin Tapestry Works, who secretly dreams of escaping her circumstances and creating her own masterpiece. When her father is unjustly imprisoned, Alouette’s efforts to save him lead to her own confinement in the notorious Salpêtrière asylum, where thousands of women are held captive and cruelly treated. But within its grim walls, she discovers a small group of brave allies, and the possibility of a life bigger than she ever imagined. \n1939: Kristof Larson is a medical student beginning his psychiatric residency in Paris, whose neighbors on the Rue de Gobelins are a Jewish family who have fled Poland. When Nazi forces descend on the city, Kristof becomes their only hope for survival, even as his work as a doctor is jeopardized. \nA spellbinding and transportive look at a side of Paris known to very few—the underground city that is a mirror reflection of the glories above—Paula McLain’s unforgettable new novel chronicles two parallel journeys of defiance and rescue that connect in ways both surprising and deeply moving. \nAuthor: Paula McLain is the New York Times bestselling author of six novels, including The Paris Wife, Circling the Sun, and Love and Ruin, as well as two collections of poetry and a memoir. Her work has been published in over thirty-five countries, and featured in The New York Times, The Guardian, Town & Country, Real Simple, and elsewhere. \nAbout Paris Every Day: \nWhether you’re a seasoned traveler or a first-time visitor, enjoy the magical view of Paris in this book from Everyday Parisian blogger, Rebecca Plotnick. \nParis Every Day reveals the City of Light through Rebecca’s photography and offers you the insider knowledge to help cultivate a French frame of mind. \nParis is more than a destination, it’s a lifestyle. Chocolate or espresso, flower market or Mus e d’Orsay, a small park or a favorite rooftop–you’ll find ideas for scouting these and more with photographs that reflect Rebecca’s decades-long love affair with the city. \nParis Every Day is a sublime sortie that explores jazz bars, picnic spots, and casual bistros. Find advice for each season, including how to dress like a Parisian and indulge in the freshest regional produce. All bolstered by fabulous photos that include landmarks like the Luxembourg Gardens and the Eiffel Tower as well as prime places to people watch. \nIt’s not just about the sights; it’s how to best enjoy them. Whether you’re planning a trip or just want an escape, you will turn to this book again and again for Rebecca’s well-curated wisdom on relishing everyday moments in the City of Light. \nAuthor: Rebecca Plotnick is American and the founder of Every Day Parisian blog. In 2013, she decided to pack up all her belongings and left Chicago for what would become a nomadic way of living for two years between the United States and France.

Named by explorers, when six owls were spotted together in shoreline timber, the Sissiboo River runs through Weymouth, Nova Scotia where the Maine College of Art & Design offers a team residency to its alum. \nSonoma County Painter, Mary Vaughan, a MECA & D Alum, spent all of July 2025 with 5 artists of her choosing. Vaughan invites you to hear the group talk about their experiences on the Bay of Fundy on Saturday, Feb 7 at 11am. Their Residency Show based on the region opened on Feb 6 and this Feb 7 Art Talk at Backstreet Gallery in Santa Rosa, just down Art Alley near 312 South A, will bring delightful insights to art and what it meant to have time and quietude to create with a chosen team of makers across her art life. The group of 6 are from NE, CA, TN and IL. \nThe Sissiboo Six Exhibit continues all month at Backstreet – only Open on Weekends in Feb from 11am to 4pm, which also includes one final gallery day, Sunday, March 1, 11am to 4pm. We hope you will join us for our talk or simply come over on a Weekend to see the show. \nBoth Friday Cafe and Red Bird Bakery on our Arts Block just behind Juillard Park are open on Saturdays from 8 am to 2pm if you want to come down for breakfeast beforehand or lunch after our 11am to Noon Art Talk.\n\nSource: GoLocal Cooperative",

Through numerous line-up they’ve cranked out 4 LP’s and 2 EP’s of genre-hopping smart-ass punk and rock, equal parts comedy and tragedy and a healthy side of psychedelic noise. The new line-up of bassist Henry Austin Lannan and “Stark Raving” Brad Kopp (Hellbillys,Marginal Prophets,Antler Family,Stark Raving Brad) on drums dropped their first LP/CD together entitled “Outer Space Is Boring” (Nerve Center, 2023) and has performed throughout Northern California in support of that release playing shows with Dead Bob, Supersuckers, The Hangmen,Middle-Aged Queers, The Darts and many others and have played after-parties at Mosswood Meltdown. Their new album “The Midnight Show” is a co-release with Nadine Records (the adventurous Portland label run by Nasalrod/Berzerk bass legend Mandy Morgan) is a kitchen sink of punk,indie,noise,psych and surf textures that surprises with every listen. It hits the streets on February 6th,2026 with regional and national tour dates to follow. \nCut-Rate Druggist is a dynamic duo characterized by dual vocals intertwined with heavy drums and a bass guitar, culminating in a crushing wall of sound. Their powerful presence on stage earned them opportunities to support renowned acts such as Team Dresch, Beyond The Lamplight, The Avengers, Margaritas Podridas, The Dollyrots and Betty Blowtorch. \nPetaluma’s own Right To Remain open the show and bring their frantic impassioned hardcore that’s made them a favorite all over Northern California.\n\nSource: GoLocal Cooperative",

Tom’s hard rock spin on power-pop has drawn comparisons to acts of the 60’s and 70’s (think T Rex meets MC5) merging clever lyrics, catchy melodies, and stunning guitar work. With dynamic stagecraft and top-tier musicianship of rhythm section Alex Dang-Lozano (drums) and Will Durkee (bass), Tom Relling Band consistently delivers full-tilt live performances, uplifting and astounding audiences with high energy guitar-based rock n’roll. New LP “Peace In Love” is out now on Shaky Records. \nAll views expressed in this broadcast are those of the artist.\n\nSource: Luther Burbank Center",

For 50 years, YWCA Sonoma County has been the county’s answer to the need by families for refuge, advocacy, and support with domestic violence. \nLove Letters is based on the lifelong, intimate correspondence of these two characters whose entire story unfolds through written words exchanged in the form of letters. In a relationship spanning 50 years, their letters contain their hopes and ambitions, dreams and disappointments, victories and defeats throughout their separate lives. \nAfter debuting in 1988, Love Letters quickly moved to both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. Over the years, the roles were performed by notable actors such as Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow, Carol Burnett with Dennehy, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen, as well as Angelica Huston and Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. \nAccording to Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, “In addition to the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, people deserve respect, dignity and safety to conduct productive lives and care for their children. YWCA is honored to be a leader in the efforts to address needs so many people take for granted.”  \nChris Smith, who retired from the PD in 2021 but still contributes to the newspaper on occasion, said, “Bringing the power of the written word and the lost art of letter writing together with support for YWCA Sonoma County is a winning combination for me.” \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Make delicate gnudi, whipped ricotta crostini, and traditional torta di ricotta romana.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nDiscover the incredible versatility of ricotta cheese in this hands-on Italian cooking class featuring three distinct preparations that showcase this beloved ingredient. You’ll learn techniques ranging from delicate pasta-making to elegant appetizers and classic Italian desserts. Start by creating pillowy ricotta gnudi, those cloud-like dumplings that are lighter than traditional gnocchi, served with a vibrant tomato sauce. Master the art of achieving the perfect texture and learn how to handle the delicate dough for consistently beautiful results. Next, prepare whipped ricotta crostini topped with honey and fresh thyme, an elegant appetizer that balances creamy, sweet, and herbaceous flavors on crispy bread. Finally, you’ll bake torta di ricotta romana, a traditional Roman ricotta cake that’s subtly sweet and wonderfully moist. This classic dessert demonstrates how ricotta creates tender, delicate baked goods with authentic Italian character. Throughout the class, you’ll gain confidence working with fresh ricotta, understanding how its moisture content and handling affect each dish differently. Whether you’re looking to expand your Italian cooking repertoire or simply love ricotta, this class provides techniques and recipes you’ll return to again and again. Perfect for intermediate home cooks ready to explore authentic Italian preparations.Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Come brave the perilous waters of Point Reyes and join us for a rollicking good time at Point Reyes National Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Please bring your arsenal of sea chanteys, any musical instruments you'd like, and a willingness to laugh a lot!  It's so much fun when audience members lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus, and leading a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea chantey radio station and hear what's out there! Practice lyrics! Teach the chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal, mellow, and supportive, so if you've been wanting to push your comfort edge and lead a song, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather just singalong with the chantey choruses, that's fine too. We always have a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of all levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys, there may be lyrics that are not appropriate for children. Reservations not required. To be added to the notification email list for future singalong dates, please email pore\\_info@nps.gov For more information, please visit: nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/calendar.htm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCherie\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence, strength, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Last summer, Barbosa premiered his second hour-long stand-up special, Ralph Barbosa: Planet Bosa, as part of Hulu’s new Hularious comedy brand. \nHis first hour-long stand-up special, Ralph Barbosa: Cowabunga, premiered on Netflix on October 31, 2023, and ranked as the #3 TV show on Netflix throughout its first week on the service. \nIn July 2024, Barbosa was selected as one of Variety’s 10 Comics to Watch for 2024 and toured theaters throughout North America, including two sold-out theater shows as part of the Netflix Is A Joke Fest 2024, as well as hosting the kick-off show. 2023 was Barbosa’s break-out year, during which he was a guest on The Joe Rogan Experience, made his debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and performed Comedy Central Stand-up Featuring: Ralph Barbosa, which topped 6 million views on YouTube. \nBarbosa also starred in the HBO Max comedy special, Entre Nos: The Winners 3 in 2022, and earlier that year his Don’t Tell Comedy performance was released on YouTube and now has over 6 million views. \n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Cardio Dance Fitness 6:30 - 7:30pm This intermediate class is designed for those who are interested in a more rigorous style training and requires endurance. Activity will mostly involve dance cardio mixed with some calisthenics training to include jumping, running, or participating in rigorous dance cardio. Think of it as boot camp dance cardio training! Please note: This class is not for people with mobility ailments or injuries preventing active movement.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

My path has been shaped by a foundation in existential philosophy and psychology, medicine circles, and a lifelong study of contemplative and esoteric traditions. Out of my own longing for community and a commitment to the needs of the moment, I am passionate about creating spaces for men to gather in honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity — places where we can face our struggles, share our truths, and remember the healing power of connection.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

My path has been shaped by a foundation in existential philosophy and psychology, medicine circles, and a lifelong study of contemplative and esoteric traditions. Out of my own longing for community and a commitment to the needs of the moment, I am passionate about creating spaces for men to gather in honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity — places where we can face our struggles, share our truths, and remember the healing power of connection.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feels like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way. His voice is raw and real, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest, and that’s exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Americana; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie, blues legends like Howlin’ Wolf,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe, and master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and connects audiences, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s soft and haunting, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay with you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sound. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness, connection, love, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band show, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOver the years, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless touring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists like Shakey Graves, St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Sarah Jarosz, and Alice O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock, SXSW, and High Sierra Music Festival, but his focus has always been on making music that means something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending years on the road, self-funding his albums, and navigating the ups and downs of life as an independent artist, husband, and father. But through it all, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music that connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real, that makes you stop and listen, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Corb Lund is an alt-country singer-songwriter from Alberta, Canada. He grew up in a ranching and rodeo family in the foothills of Southern Alberta, then spent the early years of his career writing songs and playing bass for the indie rock band  called the smalls. \n\nLund’s music reflects his Western heritage and rock and roll roots. His distinct blend of Americana-meets-roots-meets-alt-country has attracted accolades from critics in Canada and the U.S., who have called him “one of the best contemporary country songwriters” \\(Popmatters\\) and one of the “10 New Country Artists You Need to Know” \\(Rolling Stone Country\\). \n\nLund’s 2015 release, Things That Can’t Be Undone, was produced by Grammy Award-nominated producer Dave Cobb \\(Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton\\).

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "“If I was forced to categorize it, I’d call it modern folk. It’s powerful, romantic, and giddy. And the two are insanely infectious together onstage, like a musical and a personal love fest all at once.”  – Huffington Post  With more than a dozen albums and over a thousand shows between them, Ty Greenstein and Ingrid Elizabeth of Mouths of Babes are no strangers to the contemporary folk music scene. For years, their respective bands Girlyman and Coyote Grace captivated thousands of loyal fans as they criss-crossed the country, rocked festival main stages, and toured with the likes of the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Now, as Mouths of Babes, Ty and Ingrid have distilled the very best of the songwriting, musicianship, and humor of their previous groups into a new duo that brings more style and depth than ever before.  Mouths of Babes recorded their highly anticipated first full-length album, Brighter In the Dark at Prairie Sun Studios in northern California last summer on the strength of a wildly successful, 800-backer, $56,000 Kickstarter campaign. Released in January 2017, the self-produced album contains twelve original songs with contrasting themes of light and dark, tragedy and comedy, personal and political. Mixed by Stewart Lerman \\(Dar Williams, Bob Dylan\\), Brighter features guest appearances from Birds of Chicago, Tania Elizabeth \\(The Avett Brothers\\), Mai Bloomfield \\(Jason Mraz\\) and others.  No Depression writes, “Mouths of Babes could never have predicted how necessary Brighter In The Dark \\[would be\\] in a post-Trump world. The album title is fitting. We need music that shows people struggling against social expectations, that reminds us that we all have the resilience we need to make it through.” Thinking Lyrically blog gives the album 9 stars out of 10: \"An eclectic arsenal of songs, showcasing their knack for fusing blues, folk, and soul with poetic lyrics \\[and\\] great choruses...an incredibly versatile record. One of my new favourite listens.”  The key to the Mouths of Babes magic is in the contrast; the differences in both their songwriting and personal styles makes for an unusually satisfying yin and yang. Of their live show, the Chicago Tribune writes, “They offer unique counterpoints to one another…the laidback Ty, nattily dressed in a tie and crisp suit jacket, has a rich, lovely alto. Ingrid, clad in a sultry pink satin mini-dress, is a sassy chanteuse with a lilting soprano. Trading jokes and sharing elegant harmonies, the two women display an intuitive professional bond.” They easily switch off lead vocals and play a wide array of instruments, with Ty on acoustic and electric guitars and foot percussion, and Ingrid playing upright bass, ukulele, and cajon.  Onstage, Ty makes a quiet impression as a gifted lyricist, talented multi-instrumentalist, and magnetic presence. “The poignant honesty that Ty brings to \\[her\\] tunes gives them an emotional intensity that’s as bracing as it is moving,” says Relix Magazine.  The Americana Gazette writes, “Ty’s practice of extending metaphors out toward a precipice keeps an unpredictable edge to her songs. Most writers would stop at the easy close. Ty jumps, leaving much to the imagination, to powerful effect.” Ingrid, a natural performer, easily commands audiences with her larger-than-life sassiness and professional dancer’s grace. \"With a background in burlesque, sex-education, and good ol' American roots music,\" writes Kithfolk, \"Ingrid Elizabeth brings a ton of charisma to her performances.\" Curve Magazine calls Ingrid “the fiery redheaded bassist...the unabashed, unapologetic woman who isn’t afraid to yell it all from the rooftops.”  Both Ingrid and Ty come from notable musical families, and their influences \\(namely, 60’s folk music and Motown\\) are deeply embedded in Mouths of Babes’ sound. Ty’s father, Ron Greenstein, is a member of the legendary folk harmony trio The Chad Mitchell Trio \\(where John Denver got his start\\), while Ingrid’s uncle Tom Eyen wrote the world-famous, Tony-winning musical Dreamgirls.  MTV News writes: “The songs Mouths of Babes writes and performs together fuse blues, folk, and soul, and the depth of emotion found in their lyrics is reminiscent of all that’s moving about the Dreamgirls soundtrack.”  “Hands down the best new music I've heard in years. It's damn near perfect. The instrumental performances, the arrangements, the production, the songwriting and singing…this is the kind of music that makes you glad to be alive. ” – Michael Mullane, Cafe Veritas Mouths of Babes is Ty Greenstein \\(Girlyman\\) & Ingrid Elizabeth \\(Coyote Grace\\). Equal parts celebration and blues. Folky, soulful deliciousness. Get some.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With 4 class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemian Flowers Farm, 121 Bohemian Hwy, Freestone, CA\n\nDates: Four Sundays - March 8, 15, 22, 29\n\nTime: 1 - 4 pm\n\nAges: Adults\n\nSkill Levels: All Levels\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and Memory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Marjorie Prime*, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

He has lived and worked in twelve countries and visited over seventy. His shows draw on his wide travels, cultural observations, attempts at language study, \\(occasional\\) international drinking session\\(s\\) and being a mildly confused immigrant. \n\nDave is the winner of the prestigious annual San Francisco Comedy Competition, \\(previous finalists include Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres and Dana Carvey\\) and runner up in the Moth’s largest US Grandslam storytelling competition. He recorded his debut special for Dry Bar Comedy in 2019 and has been featured on TED.com, The Irish Independent, Inc, NPR, and the Huffington Post among others. A festival favourite Dave’s videos have also gone viral many times over with over 150 million views and a social following of over one million.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

Cardio Dance Fitness 6:30 - 7:30pm This intermediate class is designed for those who are interested in a more rigorous style training and requires endurance. Activity will mostly involve dance cardio mixed with some calisthenics training to include jumping, running, or participating in rigorous dance cardio. Think of it as boot camp dance cardio training! Please note: This class is not for people with mobility ailments or injuries preventing active movement.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

If you haven’t been fortunate enough to meet Vanessa and witness one of her head-turning, fiery, and passionate performances, you should definitely make sure you do. As a master musician and multi-instrumentalist, Vanessa Collier, weaves funk, soul, rock, and blues into every powerful performance and she is downright impressive. With soulful vocals, searing saxophone, and witty songwriting, Vanessa is blazing a trail, racking up an impressive arsenal of honours, and has already singled herself out as an artist of distinction and one we would all do well to watch.\n\nIt’s not simply the accolades she has accumulated so far, although they’ve been many -- two Blues Music Awards for “Horn Player of the Year”, and a third BMA for “Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”, eight Blues Music Award Nominations \\(BMAs\\), a Blues Blast Award nomination, the Jammingest Pro Award bestowed by the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise, First Place for lyrics in the International Songwriting Competition, Best of 2014 Blues Breaker on Dan Aykroyd’s BluesMobile -- it’s the fact that she has accumulated all these honours even while her career is still in its infancy. A 2013 graduate of the prestigious Berklee College of Music, she’s toured nationally and internationally, released four critically acclaimed albums \\(2014’s Heart, Soul & Saxophone, 2017’s Meeting My Shadow, and 2018’s Honey Up, 2020’s Heart On The Line. Honey Up spent 9 weeks atop the Billboard Blues Album Charts Top 15, 3 months on the Living Blues Charts at \\#10 and \\#23, and continues to be spun on Sirius XM’s B.B. King’s Bluesville radio station! \n\nIt’s not surprising that the press has been quick to commend her efforts as well. Blues Blast Magazine affirms, “Vanessa Collier is a fresh face on the American blues scene, and in addition to her soulful vocals, she brings a mighty sax to the table...” Blues Music Magazine proclaims, “Collier is a fresh face who comes to the blues stage carrying her reed instruments, a dual degree from Berklee College of Music in Boston, a major label debut, almost two years of touring with Joe Louis Walker, and a mature musical vision…Collier commands center stage with her vocals, soloing, and stage presence.” Midwest Record exclaims, “This bluesy singing sax player knows how to bring the slinking funk to her captivating, award winning sound that has echoes in young Bonnie Raitt/Maria Muldaur vocal sounds…Killer stuff on every level, this sounds like one of the reasons you first became a music fan. Killer stuff.” and AXS.Com declares that she “might as well go ahead and add another shelf to her trophy case because clearly, she’s going to need it. With a voice that often recalls that of blues-rock stalwart Bonnie Raitt, Collier turns up the heat...”\n\nHaving first picked up the saxophone at the age of nine, Collier embarked on her road to recognition at Berklee, earning dual degrees in Performance and Music Production & Engineering. While still completing her degree, Collier landed a position touring with Joe Louis Walker for a year and a half before Joe encouraged her to strike out on her own. And strike out she did.\n\nThese days, Collier spends much of her time on the road, performing at some of the most prestigious music festivals in the world. Her talents have taken her to the Blues Music Awards Show where, in the words of the Blues Foundation, Vanessa “blew the doors off the Blues Music Awards!”; Ottawa Blues Festival, where she earned two front page newspaper photos and rave reviews after her foot stomping debut there; twice on the Legendary Rhythm and Blues Cruise, where she earned the Jammingest Pro Award and was a featured artist with Tommy Castro’s Blues Review; Briggs Farm Festival, where she was the “most popular Briggs Farm act in 2017” \\(Elmore Magazine\\), and the list continues. \n\nVanessa has won 3 Blues Music Awards - two for “Horn Player of the Year” in 2019 and 2020 and one in 2022 for “Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year”!! She has been nominated for eight Blues Music Awards since 2017, which puts her in elite company with artists such as Beth Hart, Samantha Fish, Shemekia Copeland, Ruthie Foster, Trombone Shorty, Al Basile, and Jimmy Carpenter.\n\nAs for Collier, she says she’s happy performing on stages across the world, hoping that she can make a difference with fans and followers along the way. “I am driven to do this because I find it a total form of expression and connection,” she explains. “I love connecting with an audience and feeling their energy and I hope to inspire people to follow their dreams and passions, to find what brings them joy, and then to pursue it doggedly.” Vanessa also takes that message to young people as she runs clinics across the country and is active with Blues in the Schools programs. At a recent Blues in the School program, Vanessa invited a stage full of elementary and middle school aged kids up to dance around her while she performed a blues shuffle. Watching the joy on the faces of Vanessa, the kids, and everyone in the auditorium, it is no wonder why Vanessa has become awe-inspiring to all who meet her. On top of talent and hard work, Vanessa shares an incredible heart and a strong purpose. To borrow from the words of an article in Blues Blast Magazine, “Vanessa is an important part of the future of the blues, and it would be cool to support her journey.\"\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know how to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12\\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(required!\\): Monthly \\(12\\), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Guided meditations, readings, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\+ monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\nQ&As: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

But this is more than genre labels; The music, message & intention trancends all that, forget the borders and waters that divide us, the movement is to ignite the great remembrance of who we are, our collective power, what we can be, to break the mental conditioning and find full freedom in this lifetime.\n\nThe Nattali Rize project launched out of Jamaica into the US, EU and beyond in 2014 with a strong run of captivating festival performances and national club shows. Now with tours alongside the likes of Michael Franti and Spearhead, Katchafire, Third World, J-Boog, Julian Marley, Tribal Seeds and more under their belt, the worldwide movement is ever rizing!\n\nThis is a global mash up of raw energy and vibe that together has been rocking stages since the band first burst onto the scene in 2015.\n\nAsk Nattali where she comes from, she’ll tell you “All Directions”, with no fixed address, Nattali is now based where the music takes her, Nattali Rize claims not to belong to any nation state, but to the ever-evolving community of awakening consciousness. The global mission - to uplift, unify consciousness & Rize together\n\n“Nattali is a bright light in the world with a vision that extends beyond the stage.”- Michael Franti \\(Spearhead\\)\n\nNattali Rize is recognised globally for her unwavering commitment to using her voice and music for the global shift toward Full Freedom and the movement of Truth and Justice over the systemic exploitation of the people and our planet. \n\n.\"Our intention with our music is to ignite that memory in ourselves of our individual and collective power to live life to the fullest and recognize our selves and each other as evolving beings of light. A reality of Full Freedom is a possibility on this earth and in these times. We use music to sound frequencies infused with this idea, and to resonate at a higher level than what is currently being permeated across current world culture. People are powerful; we want them to reclaim that power and no longer be servants to a system that has never, and will never, serve them to their fullest potential. As such, our frequency in this system is a rebel …  Rebel Music, Rebel Frequencies we deal with!” - Nattali Rize.\n\nThe debut album Rebel Frequency, released in May 2018 is available on all platforms now.\n\nDecember 2018 also sees the release of the official merchandise through the bands brand Rize Nation Wear.\n\n“One of the nation’s most refreshing voices” - Rolling Stone.\n\n“INFECTIOUS!”- NPR\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

We provide hand-sewing supplies and materials, but feel free to bring your own - it's all about community, creativity, and enjoying the process. By repairing what we already have and re-using materials, we're not just preserving memories and adding unique touches to our belongings - we’re also reducing waste and contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

We’ll cruise about a mile and a half downriver to the perfect moonrise vantage point, where calm water, wide skies, and glowing reflections set the scene.\n\nThis is a social, feel-good outdoor experience designed for anyone looking for something a little different to do after dark—part nature, part adventure, part pure vibe.\n\n**$60 per person includes everything:** • Hobie pedal kayak • PFD and safety lights • Experienced local guide • A memorable, moonlit river experience\n\n✨ Easy. Playful. Peaceful. Spend your evening under the full moon—on the water.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "John Doe was born in 1977 when he arrived in Los Angeles. His previous life in Tennessee, Wisconsin & Baltimore was a great & fertile time but new music and social changes led him to events that created a life in art. He graduated from Antioch College in Baltimore in 1975, worked as a roofer, aluminum siding mechanic, and ran a poetry reading series. Ms. Meyers was his landlord in the rural black community of Simpsonville , MD.\n\nJohn met Exene Cervenka at the Venice poetry workshop Nov 1976 and he started working with Billy Zoom around the same time. When DJ Bonebrake joined X in mid-1977 the line up was complete. They released six studio records, five or six singles and one live record from 1978-1993. Five of X’s records have been re-issued along with two compilations. The Unheard Music documents their lives and progress as a band from 1980-83. In 2009 the film was included in the Sundance UCLA Archive of greatest films of all time. They appeared several times on American Bandstand, Solid Gold and David Letterman. As one of the last original punk rock bands standing, they continue to tour. The day that X played a free noontime concert in Fullerton, CA, they caused Orange County’s greatest high school truancy rate to date.\n\nIn 1988 John started a family and lived in the Tehachapi Mountains, near the “Grapevine” of Highway 5, which separates southern and central California. He has recorded 8 solo records w/ numerous renowned singers and players, more recently including Patty Griffin, Dan Auerbach, Aimee Mann, Don Was, Kathleen Edwards and Greg Liesz. He has appeared in over 50 films and television productions, with some of his most notable roles in Road House, Georgia, Roadside Prophets, Great Balls of Fire, Pure Country and Roswell. He continues to act these days but more sporadically as his touring schedule has become more demanding.\n\nOther musical side projects include work with the Knitters, Jill Sobule and The Sadies. He continues to write poetry and has even taught workshops from time to time. He currently lives in Austin, TX.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Against the backdrop of over 25 years of creative collaboration, Ben Allison, Steve Cardenas, and Ted Nash weave musical conversations that are full of subtlety and surprise. They take turns arranging for the trio, which has released four albums. For this concert, they will be playing a selection of music from each of their recordings: Quiet Revolution: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre and Jim Hall, Somewhere Else: which features our arrangements of songs from Leonard Bernstein’s West Side Story, Quiet Revolution: which features classics by Jimmy Giuffre and Jim Hall, Healing Power: which features music by the iconic composer/arranger Carla Bley and Tell the Birds I Said Hello: which features previously unrecorded gems by the genius pianist/composer Herbie Nichols. To date, their albums have been streamed millions of times, and they have performed at countless festivals throughout Europe, the US, and South America. The group is modeled after reedist/composer Jimmy Giuffre’s drummerless trios of the 1950s and 60s. As jazz was becoming more expressionistic and at times bombastic, musicians like Giuffre were going in the opposite direction. They were envisioning quieter music that maintained elements of blues and folk while also embracing the emerging qualities of free playing. Ben, Steve and Ted create music that is intimate and highly conversational in tone—a ‘musical trialogue,’ where group interplay is the focus.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "You can’t water old flowers. Yes, you fall in love, you make mistakes, and so do they. You run through blackberry fields in the summer of your youth, dream in passenger seats gazing past towns and fields, imagining a future life where everything works out. I fell head over heels in love at nineteen. The kind of love where you call up your best friend and say, “I think I’ve found my soulmate.” The pull towards that first true love is strong. It consumes you, makes you question your own dreams. \n\nWe taught each other, grew up together, we were family. We fit just right, for a time. Then one day, after a long and rocky nine year road, life changed and became a complicated mess too hard to untangle. We couldn’t get our love back, no matter how many dreams that shadowed this hard truth. We grew resentful, selfish, harboring past mistakes and holding them up like armor from every blow. We grew up and our paths diverted. \n\nOn New Year’s Day, 2018, a great horned owl dropped dead at my exes’ feet in my mother’s yard. It felt like a daunting omen, ushering on change for the both of us. We were distraught. We couldn’t afford the taxidermy, so we placed it in a big blue plastic garbage bin. Now it felt so cheap, that mystic creature in a plastic coffin. That’s how love feels sometimes – like we don’t serve it the ending it deserves. \n\nThe omen was true. That year, I started to see the woman I could be, the woman I wasn’t yet. Anytime I felt like myself, I was alone and wandering, and I knew that was a sign that it was time for change. New Year’s Day 2019, I said goodbye to my first true love and moved across the country. Losing someone you spend every day for nearly a decade with is intense. We talked in our dreams. I knew where he was, even before I entered a place. He’d always be there if I had a feeling. Humans are connected in unexplainable ways. \n\nI was writing a lot after we broke up as a healing technique, preserving each memory like an emotional archaeologist. Late one night, I woke up from a dream where I was searching for him, my ex, at a carnival. It was so vivid. I woke myself up to write a song on my piano. The next morning, he reached out to me for the first time in months. We went out, had a drink, caught up, and he told me that the hardest part about our separation was a reoccurring nightmare where he searched for me at a carnival. In that moment, I knew, humans have ways of connecting beyond words and touch. I truly believe that. We had the same dream, without seeing each other for months. \n\nEven with all the mystic symbolism that year presented, this is an age-old story I can’t make up. We fall in love, we grow up, we change, and they don’t change with us. ‘Old Flowers’ is about heartbreak. There are a million records and songs about that, but I did not lie when writing these songs. This album is about loving and caring for the person you know you can’t be with. It’s about being afraid to be vulnerable after you’ve been hurt. It’s about a woman who is alone, but okay with that, if it means truth. \n\nThis was my truth this year – my nine year relationship ended, and I’m a woman alone in the world, but happy to know herself.  \n\nThese songs came to me alone, late nights in Bisbee, Lisbon, Nashville, and London. Sometimes I’d just cry and sing, and a song would come out. I drank too much wine while writing this record, lit too many candles. You could say this was my attempt to summon the muse, but that’s bullshit, because she was just standing there naked looking me in the eyes. So I told her the truth. \n\nThis is my story of the most heartbreaking, but soul-revealing, year of my life. I drove myself mad. I drove to the smoky mountains just to drive back. I danced with a Portuguese boxer and cried on his shoulder in a Fado cafe. I did everything an artist is “supposed to do.” But at the end of the day, beyond all the romance, these songs are my truth. I think they might be yours too.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Maybe a minute passed before I knew I’d be singing “Karaoke” for the rest of my life. The second song on Heartmind, the tenth album by Cass McCombs, “Karaoke” is a god-level burst of power-pop perfection, as fetching as anything Cass has ever cut. The springy staccato guitar, the vaporized electric keys, the melody seemingly born for singing or clapping or dancing along: Cass triangulates a perch of his very own out among The Go-Betweens, The dB’s, and The Cure, and vibrates there, a beacon. And then, of course, there is the song’s playful if painful lyrical conceit—the lover who is making all the sacred motions of commitment but whose feelings may be no more deep or real than someone simply reading the lyrics for “Vision of Love” or “Stand by Your Man” from some crowded bar’s TV screen.  \n\n \n\nSo after harmonizing alone with “Karaoke” for the twentieth time during a solo cross-country drive, I had to ask Cass for myself how it all went down: Was this heartbreak, or was it legit love? He paused, thought, then laughed. “Well, that’s the question,” he said slowly. “Neither?” Or maybe, he finally averred, both? That is—to me, anyway—the true joy of Heartmind, an eight-song album that feels more like a journey among assorted tuneful feelings, somehow shaped to meet whatever it is a particular listener needs, to mirror whatever they bring to these uniformly incandescent and tragicomic tracks. Cass has set the stage, but you get to pick the heroes and villains, the winners and losers, the jokes and the drags. He doesn’t want to give you the questions, let alone the answers.  \n\n \n\nTo wit: Did the soldier at the center of the aching country epic “Unproud Warrior” abdicate responsibility or finally claim it? As the percussion shuffles and horns sigh beneath “Krakatau,” will you agree that you can be cleansed without being killed—or be anything better than you already are while still remaining yourself? Do you identify with being enraptured by music for so long that it ultimately drained you, too, as Cass suggests \\(maybe?\\) during the wiry opener, “Music Is Blue”? These are just a few of the questions that come to mind when I hear Heartmind, but I don’t even know if they’re the right questions. Still, I can now sing along to every word. \n\n \n\nThere are, at least, some basic facts to share about Heartmind, logistical evidence that may in turn shape your own questions: Cass recorded these songs in multiple sessions on both coasts, in Brooklyn and Burbank. The great Shahzad Ismaily not only cut the staggering “Unproud Warrior” and four others here but also played lots of bass. Buddy Ross tracked “New Earth,” a paean of post-humanity renewal with several sharp wisecracks. Ariel Rechtshaid—now a dozen years into his collaboration with Cass, which began with 2009’s Catacombs—captured Cass’ scintillating guitars on “Belong to Heaven,” a thoughtful consideration of what we all lose when we lose an old friend to the inevitable end. The steadfast Rob Schnapf \\(who previously produced McCombs’ ANTI- debut, Mangy Love\\) mixed and merged it all.  \n\n \n\nWynonna Judd \\(yes, that one\\) offers harmonies, while her beau Cactus Moser provides some lap steel. Joe Russo, Kassa Overall, Danielle Haim, Nestor Gomez: I don’t actually need to tell you how good everyone who pitches in here is, because you’ll be able to hear it for yourself the moment you listen. \n\n \n\nSpeaking of hearing it for yourself, here’s how I hear at least some of these songs: “Unproud Warrior,” featuring the aforementioned Wynonna, is a necessary anthem for these times, where we all seem to have opinions about the critical news of the day without ever quite knowing what to do about it. Invoking Stephen Crane, S.E. Hinton, and fast-food restaurants, it is an allegory about our perception and ownership of responsibility, set to an elegant C&W ache. “New Earth” celebrates the renewal that’s possible when humanity’s finally done with its bullshit, when all our temporary madness self-destructs long enough to let nature reset itself. Sorry, but you’ll be humming along to predictions of your own destruction here. And using much of the same band of rootsy weirdos as “Unproud Warrior,” “Blue Blue Band” unfurls as a sequel to Gillian Welch’s Ruination Day suite, where the offering up of oneself for entertainment always entails at least a sliver of self-destruction. Also, Cass sings that the bassist, Fritz, “cooks it hotter than grits,” which is about all any Southerner needs to hear in order to love any song. \n\n \n\nAt the risk of being didactic, I need to reiterate something here: Aside from the credits, I might be wrong about everything I’ve said about these songs. Again, sorry. Where I hear dark humor, you might hear relentless pain; where I hear winning cynicism, you might hear harrowing nihilism. And that is, in some way, the point for Cass—to write songs that speak of his moment, and then let everyone else decide how or even if they speak to their moment. These are honest offerings for absurdist times, funny confessions of frailty amid circumstances that often seem too tense for even the humble chuckle. On Heartmind, Cass McCombs enters the double-digit-album phase of his career, a quantitatively rarified place for any songwriter; rarer still, though, is the fact that he does not yet seem to have settled into a qualitative sound or pattern, of singing the same thought twice \\(or perhaps even once\\).  \n\n \n\nOne more thing I can say for certain, then? For Cass, this has never been karaoke. —Grayson Haver Currin\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

    "description": "If you like the sound of Laura Marling, Lucinda Williams, Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris... then this is a concert for your taste.\n\nSofia Talvik is a rare artist and an avid storyteller with a voice comparable to giants like Joni Mitchell, or as the Folk/Americana Magazine NoDepression said it ”A singer/songwriter who is able to evoke the essence of Laurel Canyon circa the ‘60s as expressed in the work of Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Buffy Sainte-Marie and others who were able to paint beautiful tapestries from words and music.”.\n\nNot unlike the 70's coffeehouses and speakeasy's, you will be up close and personal with a world class act that has played big festivals like Lollapalooza and SxSW and opened for artists like Maria McKee and David Duchovny \\(X-files, Californication\\). It is in this kind of setting where she can casually joke and communicate with the audience that her strength as a performer shines the most.\n\nHer delicate songs are performed in an intimate way, showing off Sofia’s angelic voice enhanced only by a tasteful mix of harmonies and delays, accompanied by the steady picking of her acoustic guitar and the rhythm section consisting of her own two feet, bells and a stomp box.\n\nShe's an experienced international touring artist who has toured through 48 U.S states, many of the countries in Europe and far away places like New Zealand.\n\nHer latest album \"Center of the Universe\" was released in 2023. Throughout the 10 songs on the album, there is a broad range of topics of some of life’s most earnest moments, ranging from the Ukraine War, American women’s rights, the thousands of missing children in the US and the torment of domestic violence survivors across the world. The album went straight into the top 20 on Folk Radio Charts USA in August 2023, with the first single charting in the top 10. The album was considered for a Grammy nomination for \"Best Folk album\" 2023.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The book club focuses on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event but we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look forward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK Winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Award for Best Novella Winner of the Alex Award A New York Times and USA Today Bestseller Now an Apple Original series from Academy Award nominees Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and starring Emmy Award winner Alexander Skarsgård. A murderous android discovers itself in All Systems Red, a tense science fiction adventure by Martha Wells that interrogates the roots of consciousness through Artificial Intelligence. “As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure.” In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid—a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself \\(though never out loud\\) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. ABOUT THE AUTHOR MARTHA WELLS has written many novels, including the New York Times and USA Today-bestselling Murderbot Diaries series, which has won multiple Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and Alex Awards, and was adapted into an Apple Original TV series. Other titles include Witch King, City of Bones, The Wizard Hunters, Wheel of the Infinite, the Books of the Raksura series \\(beginning with The Cloud Roads and ending with The Harbors of the Sun\\), and the Nebula-nominated The Death of the Necromancer, as well as YA fantasy novels, short stories, and nonfiction.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Originally from New York, now dividing his time between Buenos Aires, Argentina and New York's Hudson Valley, Richard Shindell is a writer whose songs paint pictures, tell stories, juxtapose ideas and images, inhabit characters, vividly evoking entire worlds along the way and expanding our sense of just what it is a song may be. From his first record, Sparrow's Point \\(1992\\) to his current release, Careless \\(September 2016\\), Shindell has explored the possibilities offered by this most elastic and variable of cultural confections: the song.   \n\nThe path that led him to songwriting was both circuitous and direct. Taking up the guitar at the age of eight, he listened but imagined that composing a song was out of the question.\n\nAfter college and a nine month stint in a Zen Buddhist community in Upstate New York, he headed to Europe with his guitar, finding something not approaching a livelihood performing in the Paris Metro, where he discovered  \"I loved the acoustics in those tunnels, but only when they were empty.\" \n\nUpon running out of money he entered Union Theological Seminary, where the celestial acoustics of the chapel inspired his first \"keeper\" composition: On a Sea of Fleur de Lis. Ostensibly a paean to the Virgin Mary, the song marked his rupture from the church and the beginning of his creative life. Its underlying themes - immanence and transcendence, human love and divine love, the particular and the general - have continued to resonate through subsequent work, right up to the present. In many ways, his new album Careless, represents a further exploration of those ideas.   \n\nJoining the songwriter scene in New York City led to a deal with Shanachie Records for Shindell’s first three albums:  Sparrows Point \\(1992\\), Blue Divide \\(1994\\), and Reunion Hill \\(1997\\). The latter, produced by multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell, won the AFIM \\(NAIRD\\) award for \"Best Contemporary Folk Album\" in 1998. Its title track was covered by Joan Baez on her 1997 release, Gone From Danger. In 1998, Shindell joined forces with his friends Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky to make CryCryCry \\(Razor and Tie\\), a collection of covers. The group toured in support of this highly acclaimed album, leaving audiences spellbound by their gorgeous three-part harmonies. \n\nBy then Shindell was beginning to stretch out as a harmony singer, guitarist and performer. In 1999, Shindell released a live band album, Courier \\(Signature Sounds\\) that remains a fan favorite. The year 2000 brought the release of a new collection of originals, Somewhere Near Paterson \\(Signature Sounds\\), produced by Campbell. That year also saw a major life-change: with his Argentine wife and their two small children, Shindell moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Taking a few years to get acclimated and learn the language, in 2004 he followed up with Vuelta \\(Koch Records\\), joining with Argentine band Puente Celeste. The decade's next release was a collection of covers, South of Delia \\(2007\\), Shindell's first foray into production. More than simply a cover record, the song-selections and performances of South of Delia were that of an expatriate looking back at the country and culture he moved away from. His next collection of original songs, Not Far Now, was released by Signature Sounds in 2009. For 13 Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before, which The Telegraph \\(UK\\) called “a stunningly good record”, Shindell revisited some of his earlier material, giving fresh interpretations to old favourites. \n\nIn 2015 he joined forces again with Lucy Kaplansky to record another collection of covers, Tomorrow You’re Going \\(Signature Sounds\\), also produced by Larry Campbell. Consisting mostly of love songs, or love lost songs, it provided Shindell and Kaplansky an occasion to revel in their distinctive, two-part harmony with the backing of a top-notch band \\(Byron Isaacs, Dennis McDermott, Bill Payne, and Campbell\\) - all thanks to the participation of a committed community of fans who financed the project via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The campaign more than doubled its funding goal in less than 48 hours. \n\nShindell continues to tour nationally in the United States, with the occasional forays into Canada, the UK, and Europe. Although known primarily as songwriter, Shindell takes a more holistic view of his career. Producer, writer, singer, guitarist, interpreter: it all adds up to a life in music.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Thank you for registering for this free event. Your RSVP helps us plan for your attendance. We look forward to welcoming you! ABOUT THE BOOK Named a Best Book of the Year by: GQ, Kirkus Reviews, Booklist, Library Journal, TIME, Esquire, The Washington Post, Apple, Good Housekeeping, The New Yorker, The New York Public Library, Elle.com, The Guardian, The A.V. Club, NPR, Lithub, Entertainment Weekly, Vogue.com, The San Francisco Chronicle, Mother Jones, Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal Magazine, and more! New York Times Readers Pick: 100 Best Books of the 21st Century “A lyrical work of self-discovery that’s shockingly intimate and insistently universal…Not so much briefly gorgeous as permanently stunning.” — Ron Charles, The Washington Post On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, the debut novel from the author of The Emperor of Gladness, is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family’s history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one’s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard. With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ocean Vuong is the author of the critically acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Wounds, winner of the Whiting Award and the T. S. Eliot Prize, and Time Is a Mother, a New York Times bestseller. His writings have also been featured in The Atlantic, Harper’s, The Nation, The New Republic, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. Born in Saigon, Vietnam, he currently splits his time between western Massachusetts and New York City. On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is his first novel.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Each month they will learn about a different artist:  Phoebe Wahl \\(January\\), Antje Damm \\(February\\), Karen Collins \\(March\\), Richard Scary \\(April\\), and Hayao Miyazaki \\(May\\) . Inspired by their playful styles, students will design and develop their very own characters—deciding where these characters live, work, play, eat, and sleep! Students will be working independently as well as in groups to develop their visual storytelling muscles.  Children will create 3D sculptural worlds from their conceptualized 2D drawings. They will bring their stories to life using a mix of expressive art materials, including:\n\n watercolor, paint, pens, and collage\n\n recycled and found objects to build unique scenes\n\nTogether, we will learn:\n\nHow to use watercolor techniques to add color and mood\n\nHow scale helps characters and environments feel real\n\nThe arc of a story—beginning, middle, and end\n\nHow to build a world using background, middle ground, and foreground\n\nBy the end of the class, each child will have created their own illustrated story scene full of imagination, personality, and creativity. A perfect class for kids who love drawing, storytelling, and building new worlds!\n\nPick-up & Drop-off\n\nDrop off at 3:30 PM and pick up at 5:30 PM Drop-off and pick-up will happen outside Room 116 each week.

    "description": "Each month, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one must-read book of poems, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning contemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson, who has been an enthusiastic book club member since its beginning, meetings are open to all levels of poetry readers, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK A New Yorker and Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2024 Acclaimed poet Li-Young Lee offers a revelatory volume of ecstatic poems that search out divine voices in the silences of life, love, and death. “The poet of rapture and tenderness” \\(Major Jackson, American Poets\\), Li-Young Lee speaks these poems with the intimacy and primacy of a whisper, as if from a lover to a beloved, or a believer to God. Each poem in The Invention of the Darling is a mysterious conjunction of spirit and matter, movement and stillness, the divine and the mundane, the sacred and the forbidden. They yearn for holistic union with The Beloved, every sentence another name for The Beloved, every poem another way to say “I love you.” Forged in awe of life and love, these poems emerge from the unlit depths of our earthly, material desires and our deepest fears of mortality. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Li–Young Lee is a poet and translator. He received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for Lifetime Achievement, among other awards. Lee lives in Chicago.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit!

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

They meet on the history-scarred island of Makatea in French Polynesia, whose deposits of phosphorus once helped to feed the world. Now the tiny atoll has been chosen for humanity’s next adventure: a plan to send floating, autonomous cities out onto the open sea. But first, the island’s residents must vote to greenlight the project or turn the seasteaders away. Set in the world’s largest ocean, this awe-filled book explores that last wild place we have yet to colonize in a still-unfolding oceanic game, and interweaves beautiful writing, rich characterization, profound themes of technology and the environment, and a deep exploration of our shared humanity in a way only Richard Powers can. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Richard Powers is the author of fourteen novels, including The Overstory, Bewilderment, and Orfeo. He is the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, the Pulitzer Prize, and the National Book Award. He lives in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Robbie Fulks is a singer, recording artist, instrumentalist, composer, and songwriter. His most recent release, 2017’s Upland Stories, earned year’s-best recognition from NPR and Rolling Stone among many others, as well as two Grammy® nominations, for folk album and American roots song \\(“Alabama At Night”\\).\n\nFulks was born in York, Pennsylvania, and grew up in a half-dozen small towns in southeast Pennsylvania, the North Carolina Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge area of Virginia. He learned guitar from his dad, banjo from Earl Scruggs and John Hartford records, and fiddle \\(long since laid down in disgrace\\) on his own. He attended Columbia College in New York City in 1980 and dropped out in 1982 to focus on the Greenwich Village songwriter scene and other ill-advised pursuits.\n\nIn 1983 he moved to Chicago and joined Greg Cahill’s Special Consensus Bluegrass Band. He taught music at Old Town School of Folk Music from 1984 to 1996, and worked as a staff songwriter on Music Row in Nashville from 1993 to 1998. His early solo work -- Country Love Songs \\(1996\\) and South Mouth \\(1997\\) -- helped define the \"alternative country\" movement of the 1990s. His music from the last several years hews mainly to acoustic instrumentation; it returns him in part to his earlier bluegrass days, and extends the boundaries of that tradition with old-time rambles and sparely orchestrated reflections on love, the slings of time, and the troubles of common people.\n\nRadio: multiple appearances on WSM’s “Grand Ole Opry”; PRI’s “Whadd’ya Know”; NPR’s “Fresh Air,” “Mountain Stage,” and “World Cafe”; and the syndicated “Acoustic Cafe” and “Laura Ingraham Show.” TV: PBS’s Austin City Limits; NBC’s Today, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Later with Carson Daly, and 30 Rock. From 2004 to 2008 he hosted an hourlong performance/interview program for XM satellite radio, “Robbie’s Secret Country.” Artists who have covered his songs include Sam Bush, Kelly Hogan, Andrew Bird, Mollie O’Brien, Rosie Flores, John Cowan, and Old 97s.\n\nRobbie’s writing on music and life have appeared in GQ, Blender, the Chicago Reader, DaCapo Press’s Best Music Writing anthologies for 2001 and 2004,  Amplified: Fiction from Leading Alt-Country, Indie Rock, Blues and Folk Musicians, and A Guitar and A Pen: Stories by Country Music’s Greatest Songwriters. As an instrumentalist, he has accompanied the Irish fiddle master Liz Carroll, the distinguished jazz violinist Jenny Scheinman, and the New Orleans pianist Dr. John. As a producer his credits include Touch My Heart: A Tribute to Johnny Paycheck \\(Sugar Hill, 2004\\) and Big Thinkin’ by Dallas Wayne \\(Hightone, 2000\\). Theatrical credits include “Woody Guthrie’s American Song” and Harry Chapin’s “Cottonpatch Gospel.”  He served twice as judge for the Winfield National Flatpicking Guitar competition. He tours yearlong with various configurations.\n\nBesides country and bluegrass music, Robbie is fiercely fond of Charles Mingus, P.G. Wodehouse, quantum mechanics, his wife Donna, comedy in almost all forms, cooking, swimming laps, the past, Arthur Schopenhauer, Universal horror movies, his grandson and even his sons, coastal towns in the off-season, and rye whiskey, though in nothing like that order.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

With extra water beneath us, we’re able to glide into calm, lush stretches of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad (other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal (Char-kole brand black), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black (one fine-tip and one medium-tip).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll **Silver Memberships** and above receive **10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40**.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know how to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12\\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(required!\\): Monthly \\(12\\), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Guided meditations, readings, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\+ monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\nQ&As: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Together, they will explore Zamora’s creative process, lived experience, and the themes that animate his work.\n\nThis event is presented by Canal Alliance, the San Geronimo Valley Community Center and Book Passage, organizations united by a shared commitment to literacy, community, and cultural exchange\n\nSimultaneous English to Spanish interpretation will be provided.\n\nJavier Zamora es reconocido por su escritura poderosa e íntima que explora la migración, la identidad y el sentido de pertenencia.

This program shines a spotlight on two of his favorite voices: the basset horn and the basset clarinet. Deeper, warmer, and more velvety than their modern descendants, these instruments were prized in Mozart’s time for their ability to sing, sigh, and whisper with uncanny intimacy.\n\nThe program begins with a charming quintet by Mozart’s contemporary Johann Backofen, whose writing shows off the basset horn’s mellow glow and conversational wit. Mozart’s youthful “Milanese” string quartet follows, sparkling with elegance and invention. The program culminates in Mozart’s beloved clarinet quintet, a work of timeless beauty, virtuosity, and ingenuity performed here on a replica of the original basset clarinet Mozart had in mind. Performed on period instruments, this concert offers a chance to hear familiar music scrubbed clean—lighter, more transparent, and irresistibly alive.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

An intimate group trip, you’ll start each day from the boutique Hotel Healdsburg in the center of our charming town and every moment is personally curated by us. We’ll take you to the world-renowned regions of Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Along the way, you’ll enjoy private winery visits to the uber-luxury Robert Young Winery, the site of one of our very first dates, and a winery that Eric used to manage, the legendary Buena Vista Winery. We’ll visit the most sought after cult brewery in the world, the Russian River Brewing Co \\(yes, this is beer in Sonoma as well… trust us … we know our alcohol\\).\n\nOh, you will eat… and eat very well at my favorite Sonoma restaurants including dinner at The Dry Creek Kitchen, and a private lunch that may include more lobster than you’ve ever seen in one place, and of course, dinner at the most popular restaurant in Healdsburg, The Matheson. You’ll understand why when you visit!\n\nWe love to eat and drink, but what sets our Adventures apart is the music… a truly exclusive experience you won’t find anywhere else. I will host intimate private concerts with my friends and guest musicians, set in stunning locations across picturesque Sonoma. Some past artists have included Vincent Ingala, Richard Elliot, Peter White and Rick Braun.\n\nAnd, if you’re interested in extending your stay with me, there is an optional one-day  extension add-on that has become the signature day of our domestic Adventures, where you will experience the very finest Sonoma has to offer.\n\nI can’t wait to welcome you into this extraordinary place, a little slice of heaven we call home!\n\nCheers!

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Inspired by their playful styles, students will design and develop their very own characters—deciding where these characters live, work, play, eat, and sleep! Students will be working independently as well as in groups to develop their visual storytelling muscles.  Children will create 3D sculptural worlds from their conceptualized 2D drawings. They will bring their stories to life using a mix of expressive art materials, including:\n\n watercolor, paint, pens, and collage\n\n recycled and found objects to build unique scenes\n\nTogether, we will learn:\n\nHow to use watercolor techniques to add color and mood\n\nHow scale helps characters and environments feel real\n\nThe arc of a story—beginning, middle, and end\n\nHow to build a world using background, middle ground, and foreground\n\nBy the end of the class, each child will have created their own illustrated story scene full of imagination, personality, and creativity. A perfect class for kids who love drawing, storytelling, and building new worlds!\n\nPick-up & Drop-off\n\nDrop off at 3:30 PM and pick up at 5:30 PM Drop-off and pick-up will happen outside Room 116 each week. For safety purposes, we ask that parents come inside to sign their child in and out after each session. You can view a map of our building here.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

While we strive to create a safe and enjoyable environment, the great outdoors brings its own set of risks. By joining us, you understand and accept the inherent possibilities, but not limited to, uneven ground, changing weather, and the occasional visit from our local wildlife. We ask that you tread carefully, come prepared for all conditions, and remember to look after yourself and your belongings. \n\nBy attending our events, you acknowledge that your participation is voluntary, and you assume all responsibility for any personal injuries, accidents, or loss of property that may occur during your time with us. Gundlach Bundschu Winery and its team are dedicated to your safety, but cannot be held liable for incidents that may arise from the natural elements of this experience. \n\nIn purchasing a ticket and joining us under the open sky, you agree to these terms and release Gundlach Bundschu Winery from any claims or liabilities associated with the inherent risks of an outdoor gathering. We look forward to sharing this special place with you, where every moment is part of the journey. \n\nMAKE SURE TO VISIT OUR VENUE INFORMATION PAGE – HERE\n\nVENUE MAP\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "If you listen to just a few tracks from his latest album, you might think Creed Fisher was born with a guitar in his hand. One after another his songs remain relevant today, yet steeped with tradition classics that everyone else already knows and you don’t want to miss. Clearly he’s sharing his own stories, with experiences that range from great victories to deep battle scars. \n\nFisher hails from Odessa, TX,  where his family’s roots trace back to his granddad, who was highly involved in the oil game back in the fifties. However, Fisher took on a different passion when he started playing football at the age of 10, which eventually led to the Minor Leagues for 9 years. \n\nBut, as his football career came to a close, Fisher also saw his marriage of twelve years come to an end. It was at this point he decided to do some serious “soul searching”. Fisher tells us that the music simply “found him” during this time. He picked up a guitar in 2010 and never let it go; and after touring tirelessly for 4 years, Fisher moved from West Texas to a small town outside of San Antonio, TX, where he put together a new band, and picked up where he left off.\n\nFisher’s second album \"Ain't Scared To Bleed\" went Top 30 on the ITunes Country charts and continues to be embraced by fans all around the world. When it came to his 3rd album \"Rednecks Like Us\" it was reviewed by Country Music People magazine and got 4 out of 5 stars. Here is what they had to say...\n\n“Creed Fisher sings and writes with the confidence and authority of someone who has been at it for a hell of a lot longer than 6 years. He is at his strongest on the ballads, but tackles the ‘angry redneck’ stuff just as well. There’s the odd moment when it can all get a bit crashy and loud for me, but I’d say the same about Hank Jr. All things considered, this is very impressive indeed and I’d like to see Creed Fisher go far.\n\nFriends and fans alike anxiously await Creed Fisher’s release of his 4th album. There is no denying that Fisher is truly speaking from passion when it comes to his music. Fisher is the guy you meet that you feel like you’ve known all your life and his music feels like the songs you’ve been singing since you first discovered music. His lyrics\n\nare comfortable; his story, genuine; his spirit, humble and his talent, undeniable.”\n\nCountry Music People Magazine \n\n- September 2016\n\n- Duncan Warwick \n\nRecently in 2021, he’s been back on the road touring and will be looking forward to putting out new music for his fans.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

No other cars, just the headlights on the blacktop. Above, the cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky….\n\nHusbands Don and Rodney have lived a good long life. Together they’ve experienced the highest highs of love and family, and lows so low that they felt like the end of the world.\n\nNow, the world is ending for real. A rogue black hole is coming for Earth and in a month everything and everyone they’ve ever known will be gone.\n\nSuddenly, after 40 years together, Don and Rodney are out of time. They’re in a race against the clock to make it from Maine to Washington State to take care of some unfinished business before it’s all over.\n\nOn the road they meet those who refuse to believe death is coming and those who rush to meet it. But there are also people living their final days as best they know how—impromptu weddings, bright burning bonfires, shared meals, and new friends.\n\nAnd as the black hole draws near, among ball lightning and under a cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky, Don and Rodney will look back on their lives and ask if their best was good enough.\n\nIs it enough to burn bright if nothing comes from the ashes?\n\nAuthor: TJ KLUNE \\(he/him\\) is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling, Lambda Literary Award-winning author of The House in the Cerulean Sea, Under the Whispering Door, In the Lives of Puppets, the Green Creek Series for adults, the Extraordinaries Series for teens, and more.

No other cars, just the headlights on the blacktop. Above, the cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky….*\n\nHusbands Don and Rodney have lived a good long life. Together they’ve experienced the highest highs of love and family, and lows so low that they felt like the end of the world.\n\nNow, the world is ending for real. A rogue black hole is coming for Earth and in a month everything and everyone they’ve ever known will be gone.\n\nSuddenly, after 40 years together, Don and Rodney are out of time. They’re in a race against the clock to make it from Maine to Washington State to take care of some unfinished business before it’s all over.\n\nOn the road they meet those who refuse to believe death is coming and those who rush to meet it. But there are also people living their final days as best they know how—impromptu weddings, bright burning bonfires, shared meals, and new friends.\n\nAnd as the black hole draws near, among ball lightning and under a cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky, Don and Rodney will look back on their lives and ask if their best was good enough.\n\nIs it enough to burn bright if nothing comes from the ashes?\n\n**Author: TJ KLUNE** (he/him) is the *New York Times* and *USA Today* bestselling, Lambda Literary Award-winning author of *The House in the Cerulean Sea*, *Under the Whispering Door*, *In the Lives of Puppets*, the Green Creek Series for adults, the Extraordinaries Series for teens, and more.

An intimate group trip, you’ll start each day from the boutique Hotel Healdsburg in the center of our charming town and every moment is personally curated by us. We’ll take you to the world-renowned regions of Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Along the way, you’ll enjoy private winery visits to the uber-luxury Robert Young Winery, the site of one of our very first dates, and a winery that Eric used to manage, the legendary Buena Vista Winery. We’ll visit the most sought after cult brewery in the world, the Russian River Brewing Co \\(yes, this is beer in Sonoma as well… trust us … we know our alcohol\\).\n\nOh, you will eat… and eat very well at my favorite Sonoma restaurants including dinner at The Dry Creek Kitchen, and a private lunch that may include more lobster than you’ve ever seen in one place, and of course, dinner at the most popular restaurant in Healdsburg, The Matheson. You’ll understand why when you visit!\n\nWe love to eat and drink, but what sets our Adventures apart is the music… a truly exclusive experience you won’t find anywhere else. I will host intimate private concerts with my friends and guest musicians, set in stunning locations across picturesque Sonoma. Some past artists have included Vincent Ingala, Richard Elliot, Peter White and Rick Braun.\n\nAnd, if you’re interested in extending your stay with me, there is an optional one-day  extension add-on that has become the signature day of our domestic Adventures, where you will experience the very finest Sonoma has to offer.\n\nI can’t wait to welcome you into this extraordinary place, a little slice of heaven we call home!\n\nCheers!

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Of the many marks of genius associated with rock n’ roll greatness, the knack for surrounding oneself with transformational talent looms especially large, with The Rolling Stones being perhaps the most notable example. Jeffrey Halford treads a poetic rootsy path on his latest release, SOUL CRUSADE, combining a bulletproof collection of songs inspired by gospel, folk, soul, and blues, with a formidable roster of musical contributors. The result is one of Halford’s most approachable and easy-grooving.\n\nHis latest album release, SOUL CRUSADE, is the follow-up to the critically acclaimed record WEST TOWARDS SOUTH. The album came out in Europe on Continental Song City, debuted in September at \\#2, and then undisputedly reached \\#1 in October 2022 and stayed in the chart for four months. \n\nJEFFREY HALFORD & THE HEALERS are gearing up for their eighth European tour in September and October 2025, bringing their signature blend of raw rock ‘n’ roll, country, and soul back to the stage. But this tour isn’t just another run—it marks the 25th anniversary of KEROSENE, the album \\(release date Friday, August 29th, 2025\\) that put Halford on the map as a true Americana troubadour.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit!

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

You'll hear fascinating stories from the perspectives of long-ago Petalumans—young workers, entrepreneurs, and colorful characters whose daily lives revolved around the river.\n\nPaddle in stable sit-on-top kayaks through and beyond Petaluma's charming downtown, while gaining a deeper appreciation for how this tidal waterway shaped the city and the region. Visitors are often surprised by how much they learn—and many come back with friends.\n\n$75 per person, all-inclusive. No paddling experience necessary.

The Fight over Facts.**\n\n***“Designed for laughs, but the play has a provocative undercurrent regarding issues that make it a compelling piece of theatre.”* —Cincinnati CityBeat**\n\n***The Lifespan of a Fact* is a critically acclaimed Broadway play that delves into the contentious realm where truth and storytelling intersect. The narrative centers on Emily Penrose, the exacting editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine, who assigns Jim Fingal, an ambitious young fact-checker, to verify a groundbreaking essay by renowned author John D’Agata. As Jim meticulously scrutinizes the piece, he discovers numerous embellishments, igniting a fierce debate over the boundaries of factual accuracy versus creative license. This fast-paced, blistering comedy offers a timely exploration of the high-stakes world of publishing, where the quest for truth becomes a battleground of wit, ethics, and editorial judgment.**\n\n**The play has been lauded for its sharp dialogue and thought-provoking themes, prompting audiences to question: In storytelling, how far can one go before the facts become fiction?**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: 85 mins, no intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185\n\n**boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Duets set a milestone in Billboard Chart history because, with the CD, Anka became the only artist to have a CD on the Billboard Top 100 Chart for seven consecutive decades. \nAt 81 years old, Paul Anka continues to write and record. His latest two albums, Making Memories and Sessions, were released in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The albums featured new and never-before recorded songs as well as new takes on old classics, notably “Put Your Head On My Shoulder,” with Olivia Newton John, one of her last recorded songs, and “My Way,” featuring Michael Buble and Andrea Bocelli. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.
