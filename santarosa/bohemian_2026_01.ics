  IN THE CLOUDS**\n\nEXHIBIT DATES:  December 29 – January 25\, 2026\n\n
 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting 
 the Gallery January 4\, 10\, 17\, 24\,11 am to 2:30 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Sm
 all Works Showcase presents **“Yosemite\,” Ron Sumner’s** collection
  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal
 lery January 2\, 4\, 14\, 28\, 2:30 – 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 30

 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting 
 the Gallery January 4\, 10\, 17\, 24\,11 am to 2:30 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Sm
 all Works Showcase presents **“Yosemite\,” Ron Sumner’s** collection
  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal

 d heartfelt passion to every performance. Her voice wraps her lyrics into 
 a dreamscape of sound and story\, touching on love\, friendship\, heartbre
 ak and self-reflection. Tony Gibson's songwriting blends infectious melodi
 es with honest\, emotionally resonant lyrics. His music feels both familia
 r and fresh\, painting vivid portraits of real-life moments. Michael Fecsk
 es\, a classically trained cellist and composer\, adds a unique depth to t
 he group's sound. Drawing from his Hungarian and Caribbean roots\, his com
 positions are rich and soulful\, and his experience as a performer and edu
 cator brings both sensitivity and creativity to the ensemble. Together\, D
 awn\, Tony and Michael form a dynamic singer-songwriter/folk/pop trio. Sin
 ce 2021 they've combined their individual voices and musical influences in
 to a lush\, intimate soundscape\, layering acoustics guitar\, piano\, and 
 cello\, with haunting vocal harmonies. Whether sharing original compositio
 ns or fresh takes on covers\, they've captivated audiences throughout Sono
 ma\, Napa and the North Bay with performances that are both personal and p
 owerful."

 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting 
 the Gallery January 4\, 10\, 17\, 24\,11 am to 2:30 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Sm
 all Works Showcase presents **“Yosemite\,” Ron Sumner’s** collection
  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal
 lery January 2\, 4\, 14\, 28\, 2:30 – 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 30

 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting

  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal

 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting

 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\

 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal

 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son

 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son

 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting 
 the Gallery January 4\, 10\, 17\, 24\,11 am to 2:30 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Sm
 all Works Showcase presents **“Yosemite\,” Ron Sumner’s** collection
  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal

DESCRIPTION:with Elissa Epel\, Nichol Joy Chase and Eve Ekman\n\nDeep rest
  is a powerful pathway to healing\, recalibrating our nervous system towar
 d ease\, clarity\, and equanimity. In this program\, we explore the scienc
 e and art of restoration—how meditation\, breathwork\, sensory immersion
 \, restorative yoga\, and live contemplative music nourish emotional and c
 ellular renewal.\n\nWe also lean into the power of creativity\, and imagin
 ation as catalysts for transformation. Art forms like poetry\, music\, dan
 ce\, and other creative expressions help soften stress patterns\, expand p
 erception\, and open us to new ways of thinking and being.\n\nEmotional aw
 areness becomes a bridge—from self to systems\, from tension toward whol
 eness—as we rest in a supportive environment and beautiful setting\, hel
 d by community and the earth itself.  Guest teacher Eve Ekman will lead a
 n exercise in promoting emotional awareness and equanimity.\n\nTogether\, 
 we reconnect with deep rest as a generative force\, opening us to mystery\
 , creativity\, and the joyful possibilities of becoming.

 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son

 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov

 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal

  IN THE CLOUDS**\n\nEXHIBIT DATES:  December 29 – January 25\, 2026\n\n
 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting 
 the Gallery January 4\, 10\, 17\, 24\,11 am to 2:30 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Sm
 all Works Showcase presents **“Yosemite\,” Ron Sumner’s** collection
  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal
 lery January 2\, 4\, 14\, 28\, 2:30 – 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 30

DESCRIPTION:with Elissa Epel\, Nichol Joy Chase and Eve Ekman\n\nDeep rest
  is a powerful pathway to healing\, recalibrating our nervous system towar
 d ease\, clarity\, and equanimity. In this program\, we explore the scienc
 e and art of restoration—how meditation\, breathwork\, sensory immersion
 \, restorative yoga\, and live contemplative music nourish emotional and c
 ellular renewal.\n\nWe also lean into the power of creativity\, and imagin
 ation as catalysts for transformation. Art forms like poetry\, music\, dan
 ce\, and other creative expressions help soften stress patterns\, expand p
 erception\, and open us to new ways of thinking and being.\n\nEmotional aw
 areness becomes a bridge—from self to systems\, from tension toward whol
 eness—as we rest in a supportive environment and beautiful setting\, hel
 d by community and the earth itself.  Guest teacher Eve Ekman will lead a
 n exercise in promoting emotional awareness and equanimity.\n\nTogether\, 
 we reconnect with deep rest as a generative force\, opening us to mystery\
 , creativity\, and the joyful possibilities of becoming.

 6:30 pm**\n\n**Artist Walkthrough: Saturday\, January 24th at 3:30 pm**\n\
 nDavid Lee Hoffman has spent more than four decades traveling the remote b
 ackcountry of Asia in search of the world’s finest rare\, organic\, and 
 wild pure leaf teas\, becoming the first American to work directly with te
 a farmers in China and to form joint ventures with long-established tea ga
 rdens. This deep engagement with place and culture is captured beautifully
  by his photographic essay of his 1971 journey to the remote Himalayan reg
 ion of Dolpo\, Nepal\, where he documented landscapes and communities rare
 ly seen by outsiders. Whether through tea or photography\, Hoffman’s wor
 k is marked by respect\, authenticity\, and a commitment to preserving mom
 ents\, traditions\, and environments on the cusp of change.
