DESCRIPTION:A Night of Experimental Music featuring Space and Seakeeper\n\
 nJoin us for a night of experimental music that will blow your mind! Satur
 day\, January 10th - 8pm to 11pm\n\nSPACE is a four-piece psych rock band 
 from Sebastopol\, California. Their music combines elements of funk\, dub\
 , krautrock\, post-rock\, ambient\, and improvisational music.\n\nSPACE fa
 vors the collective mindset in their music\, using hypnotic themes as laun
 ching pads for spontaneous group improvisation.\n\nThey are a multigenerat
 ional group who draw on decades of playing experience. Heading up the rhyt
 hm section\, Matt Stevens (bass) and Kyle Walsh (drums) are an unstoppable
  groove machine. On guitars\, Alex Gilman and Josh Gest paint deep and ric
 h tapestries of sound. Together\, they move as one unit in sonic explorati
 on.\n\nEach bandmember has performed widely in Sonoma County\, the Bay Are
 a\, and beyond. So far the band has garnered a following among fellow loca
 l explorers of psychedelic landscapes\, and seeks to bring their unique so
 und to more like-minded folks. Come check out SPACE for a live experience 
 that activates both body and mind. **https://officialspaceband.com/home** 
 Featuring SEAKEEPER \, of Santa Rosa\, CA\, formed by Jackson Hale (drums)
  and Kyle Foster (lead guitar) in 2023\, now joined by Lance Vermeer (bass
 ) and Cole Hornstein (rhythm guitar)\, is a musical venture which seeks to
  bring listeners on audible ventures through lush\, driving melodies and d
 reamy\, funk-laden basslines. With Jackson Hale's 20 years of drumming and
  15 years of solo music production and performance\, SEAKEEPER's precisely
  curated sonic personality sprung to life as soon as initial collaboration
  with life-long blues\, rock\, and metalcore guitarist Kyle Foster began. 
 To further elevate the sound of the band\, Lance Vermeer joined in 2024\, 
 bringing along a rich toolset of bass-playing chops rooted in years of jaz
 z combo performance and progressive metal stylings. Dissatisfied by the us
 e of backing tracks as their 4th member\, SEAKEEPER pressed onward to find
  another member\, quickly meeting guitarist Cole Hornstein\, who now provi
 des the band's harmonic depth and textural character. The band's first EP 
 "The Curse" was released on May 24th 2025\, followed by the full-length al
 bum "Maritime Standard" on August 26th. **https://seakeeper.online/** 21+

DESCRIPTION:From her beginnings as a child singing on the streets of Paris
  to becoming an international star\, Edith Piaf is undoubtedly the voice o
 f French music. Much of Piaf’s music resonated with her own personal lif
 e as she specialized in Chanson and Torch Songs about love\, loss\, and s
 orrow. Belovedly known as “The Little Sparrow” Piaf ascended beyond th
 e skies of Paris to World-Wide fame through timeless classics such as Pada
 m\, Milord\, L’Accordéoniste\, and La Vie En Rose. SonoMusette\, featur
 ing native Parisian singer Mimi Pirard\, transports us back to mid-1900s P
 aris through the evocative songs of Edith Piaf. This is the Paris that sti
 ll lives for many of us in our memories… and in our imaginations. Mimi P
 irard’s powerful and emotional interpretations of these classic songs p
 rovide a freshness and excitement that is faithful to the spirit and tradi
 tion of the original versions. The formidable musicians of SonoMusette wea
 ve musette accordion\, piano\, guitar\, upright bass\, and drums to creat
 e a musical tapestry for these enchanting songs and melodies. The concert 
 will also feature a set of music made famous by other iconic French perfor
 mers of the era.\n\nClose you eyes and be transported to the heart of Pari

DESCRIPTION:Celebrate the genius of one of music's greatest innovators - R
 ay Charles - performed by an extraordinary ensemble of Bay Area all-stars.
  This is soulful power\, timeless emotion\, and live performance mastery. 
 In tribute to the iconic singer\, pianist\, and bandleader\, this striking
  septet brings Ray's influential songbook to life with heart\, finesse\, a
 nd deep groove. Meet the performers: Tony Lindsay brings decades of soulfu
 l power to the stage as a Grammy-winning vocalist best known for his time 
 with Santana. With credits alongside Patti Austin\, Aretha Franklin\, Curt
 is Mayfield\, and Steve Winwood\, Tony's voice blends soulful depth with e
 xplosive energy. Chris Cain is an internationally acclaimed guitarist and 
 recording artist whose blues-drenched solos and jazz-inspired riffs have d
 rawn praise from legends and fans alike. With over a dozen albums\, Chris'
 s playing is a conversation of fire\, finesse\, and heartfelt expression. 
 Glenn Walters is a vocalist whose warmth and expressiveness have anchored 
 seminal Bay Area bands. The San Francisco Examiner once likened his voice 
 to something "as warm and comforting as a mink coat." Keyboard virtuoso Da
 ve Mathews started playing piano at age seven and has shared stages with T
 ower of Power\, Etta James\, Boz Scaggs\, and Santana. His command of pian
 o\, Hammond organ\, and electric keys brings rich texture and rhythmic fir
 e to the group. Bassist DeWayne Pate graduated from the Musicians Institut
 e and has backed top Bay Area acts including Huey Lewis and the News and R
 obben Ford. A columnist and educator as well as a performer\, DeWayne's gr
 ooves are both sophisticated and deeply rooted. Dynamic drummer Kevin Haye
 s Kevin Hayes is a legendary drummer for numerous acts including his curre
 nt outfit\, the Robert Cray band. Hayes has been a major player on the blu
 es scene for over 20 years now\, accompanying the most impressive names in
  the business: BB King\, Etta James\, John Lee Hooker and Van Morrison to 
 name but a few! This tribute isn't imitation - it's celebration. Each musi
 cian brings deep respect\, individual artistry\, and a lifetime of musical
  mastery to honor the legacy of Ray Charles in ways that feel alive\, fres
 h\, and deeply moving. Tickets: $35 General Admission\, $25 ADA Accessible

 t print was made on pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his m
 other's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into hi
 s 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 
 6 decades\, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's un
 usual working method. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud'
 s extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Ston

 for over 45 years\, a legendary relationship in the art world.\n\nExhibiti

 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting

 ill help you uncover the pathways to equanimity and prosperity. Since we o
 ften bring less mindfulness to financial matters than we do to other areas
  of our lives\, it is an arena in which we have surprising opportunities f
 or transformation. Through interactive exercises\, meditations tailored to
  money\, and the power of an intentional community\, you’ll learn how to
  access your money wisdom\, make more objective spending and money decisio
 ns\, mitigate the comparing mind\, lessen your allegiance to old patterns\
 , decrease anxiety\, and cultivate a mindset of “enough” that changes 
 everything.\n\nRegardless of your financial situation\, it’s possible to
  shift from fear to confidence. Together\, we will loosen our inherited be
 liefs and experience the paradox of how letting go offers a path toward ab
 undance.\n\nWho would you be if you had a new way of relating to money?

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 : Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still lifes of cakes\, pies and gumball 
 machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body
  of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a 
 life-long passion for printmaking---his first print was made on pieces of 
 linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And h
 e continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will hi
 ghlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exploring common t
 hemes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addit
 ion\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship w
 ith his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first majo
 r exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years\, a legendar
 y relationship in the art world. Exhibition generously sponsored by: Crown

 a phenomenon\, selling out shows\, winning over new fans\, enjoying tremen

 f &quot\;eclectic folk pop&quot\; songs that are personal\, playful and po
 litical.” –Paul Liberatore\, Marin IJ\n\n \n\n &quot\;An amazing colle
 ction of talented local musicians has banded together and released a stunn
 ing new CD. &quot\;Severland\,&quot\; the latest from San Francisco's Blam
 e Sally\, should bring this female foursome universal acclaim . Individual
 ly\, Renee Harcourt\, Monica Pasqual\, Jeri Jones and Pam Delgado have lon
 g displayed stirring singer-songwriter gifts. Together they're a powerhous
 e unit\, presenting outstanding lead vocals and harmonies. &quot\;Severlan
 d&quot\; carves out a strong identity on the indie-pop edges of Americana.
  Among the highlights \\(though there's not a weak track among the dozen h
 ere\\) are the riveting title tune\, the piano-driven &quot\;Fillmore Stre
 et\,&quot\; the haunting &quot\;Devil to Pay&quot\; and the country-rocker
  &quot\;Trouble.&quot\; &quot\;\, Paul Freeman\, Palo Alto Daily News\n\n 
 \n\n Severland is the quartet's strongest and most cohesive album...To put
  it in Crosby\, Stills\, Nash &amp\; Young terms\, Severland is their Déj

 \*\\*\\* Only while supplies last. Vera always knew she didn't fit in. Whe
 n she learns that she is meant to be in another time\, she leaps at the ch
 ance to embrace a new life in a world of valor\, intrigue\, and unexpected
  magic in this bold and romantic retelling of Arthurian legend . . . 22-ye
 ar-old Vera is at a crossroads: waiting tables\, grieving her previous rel
 ationship\, and jogging aimlessly each morning as if toward an uncertain f
 uture. Then an odd man shows up at her workplace\, insisting that she was 
 once the legendary Queen Guinevere of Camelot\, and that her lost memories
  hold the key to changing both the past and the present. Somehow\, it all 
 feels like the direction she's been looking for. But when she asks the mys
 terious man to tell her more about Lancelot\, Arthur\, and a faithless que
 en\, he can only say that much of what she's heard about Camelot is wrong.
  The truth\, he claims\, is something she must see for herself. After jump
 ing through a portal in Glastonbury's historic center\, Vera is not prepar
 ed for what she finds. Magic is everywhere\, but a curse on the kingdom me
 ans it dwindles every day. She has no idea how to perform a queen's duties
 . Her fast friendship with Lancelot sets gossip flowing\, and the stranger
  she must call "husband" often refuses to meet her eye. Arthur is a puzzle
 : cold\, forbidding\, and\, while angry to her face\, keeps leaving secret
  tokens of tenderness in her chambers. Worst of all\, Vera's memories-and 
 the answers locked within them-show no signs of returning. If Vera is trul
 y destined to save Camelot\, she'll have to trust her instincts. And her k
 ing will have to trust her . . . Author: Paula Lafferty is the author of L
 a Vie De Guinevere\, a feminist timeslip reimagining of King Arthur's lege
 nd that was independently published through a hugely successful Kickstarte
 r campaign before being traditionally released by Kensington Publishing. I
 t has since become an international sensation\, published in 10 countries 
 and translated into 8 languages\, with an audiobook edition narrated by Ju

DESCRIPTION:Exploring the Essential Question: An In-Person Retreat\, St. C
 olumba’s Inverness with Rachel Gaunt\n\nJanuary 9-10\, 2026\n\nExplore t
 he essential question: "What must I do to be at peace\, so that I can live
  presently\, and die gracefully?"\n\nThis essential question seems to reso
 nate with everyone\, no matter what age or stage they are at. However\, it
  has special resonance for those of us in our later years. Each person wil
 l naturally have their own personal response to the question. That is to b
 e expected. But often the themes are universal. For example: What does it 
 mean to be at peace with myself? What do I still long to do\, or say\, or 
 be? What relationships in my life are full\, complete and up to date?\n\nA
 re there any that feel like they need attention and healing? What things a
 re still unsaid or undone? \n\nPresented as a weekend retreat\, this retr
 eat opens a space for people to identify something important that they wan
 t to attend to. The retreat maximum is 8.\n\nRachel Guant is an experience
 d coach and facilitator\, Rachel Gaunt\, CPCC\, will lead the retreat\, an
 d support each person in their process. Using a mix of sharing in small gr
 oups\, journalling\, guided visualization\, play\, and creativity\, the wo
 rkshop will take people on a journey deep down into their own truth\, and 
 re-emerge to find the courage and clarity to move forward.\n\nWhen\\*:  F

 RECEPTION: Saturday\, January 3\, 3:30 – 5:30 PM:  Join Gen Zorich and 
 Ron Sumner to celebrate the show. Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma C
 ounty artist**\, Gen Zorich\,** presents **In the Clouds\,** a collection 
 of oil paintings that explore the ever-changing cloudscapes that drift acr
 oss our landscapes.  These works celebrate their beauty while reflecting 
 their deeper environmental significance. Zorich’s background as a geolog
 ist and environmental scientist informs her work\, giving a deep understan
 ding of the natural world.  “Sonoma Wine Country” draws the eye as th
 e rhythmic cloud shapes mirror the splayed pattern of the vineyard below.
   Billowing pink-orange cloud shapes spark excitement in “In the Clouds
 .”  Commenting on her inspiration\, Zorich noted\, “I am drawn to clo
 uds – they’re beautiful and a powerful symbol of transformation.  And
  they are a reminder of climate change\, one of the most important issues 
 of our time.”\n\nZorich is a life-long self-taught artist with a deep pa
 ssion for nature and the living earth.  This exhibit marks her featured a
 rtist debut as the Upstairs Art Gallery’s newest member.  Drawing on he
 r geologist training\, Zorich blends scientific insight with artistic insp
 iration\, capturing landscapes that have long inspired her imagination.  
 An award-winning artist\, she has exhibited regionally\, nationally and in
 ternationally.  Locally\, she has been a long-time participant in the Son
 oma County Art Trails program.\n\nMeet the Artist: Zorich will be hosting 
 the Gallery January 4\, 10\, 17\, 24\,11 am to 2:30 pm.\n\nThe Stairway Sm
 all Works Showcase presents **“Yosemite\,” Ron Sumner’s** collection
  of paintings that celebrate Yosemite’s wild beauty.  “Vernal Falls\,
 ” a watercolor\, highlights many of the aspects of that wild environment
  – crashing water falling on a rocky stream surrounded by those ever-lov
 in’ evergreens.  The excitement of being there is hard to put in words\
 , as Sumner notes\, “It’s easier to feel than in any way to explain Yo
 semite’s grandeur.”\n\nMeet the Artist: Sumner will be hosting the Gal

 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 wild pure leaf teas\, becoming the first American to work directly with te
 a farmers in China and to form joint ventures with long-established tea ga

  by his photographic essay of his 1971 journey to the remote Himalayan reg
 ion of Dolpo\, Nepal\, where he documented landscapes and communities rare
 ly seen by outsiders. Whether through tea or photography\, Hoffman’s wor

 nDavid Lee Hoffman has spent more than four decades traveling the remote b
 ackcountry of Asia in search of the world’s finest rare\, organic\, and 
 wild pure leaf teas\, becoming the first American to work directly with te
 a farmers in China and to form joint ventures with long-established tea ga
 rdens. This deep engagement with place and culture is captured beautifully
  by his photographic essay of his 1971 journey to the remote Himalayan reg
 ion of Dolpo\, Nepal\, where he documented landscapes and communities rare
 ly seen by outsiders. Whether through tea or photography\, Hoffman’s wor
 k is marked by respect\, authenticity\, and a commitment to preserving mom
