    "description": "Contemporary global anxieties over the gradual slide into governmental totalitarianism find an original and touching outlet in this resonant drama about youth culture in Japan. Best friends Kou and Yuta run afoul of their disciplinarian principal, who has installed draconian surveillance. As the boys try to figure out how to align themselves within the increasingly oppressive education system, larger external forces summon further threats, including constant looming natural disasters.

    "description": "Drawing on over 45 years of training, teaching, and competing, Mary Hoedeman has created a clear, approachable program designed to help dancers feel confident, comfortable, and successful on the social dance floor.\n\nNight Club is a sophisticated and elegant way to slow dance — emphasizing balance, connection, musicality, and ease rather than memorized patterns or performance.\n\nIn this workshop, Mary breaks Night Club down to its essentials, identifying only the relevant steps and principles needed to accomplish the movement. From there, dancers are guided through a simple structure repeated 21 times — until the dance smiles back.\n\nThis method allows the body to learn naturally through repetition, resulting in:\n\n  * Smooth, relaxed movement\n  * Increased confidence and balance\n  * Clear lead-and-follow connection\n  * A deeper sense of musical timing\n\nThis workshop is appropriate for:\n\n  * New dancers\n  * Experienced social dancers\n  * Anyone wanting a graceful, confident slow dance they can use immediately\n\nNo partner is required. Roles rotate frequently, and the environment is welcoming, supportive, and grounded in real social dancing.\n\nThis is not about performance or perfection — it’s about learning to feel good while dancing.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "From Executive Producers Richard Gere and Oren Moverman.\nWISDOM OF HAPPINESS shows us a timeless truth: happiness is still possible, even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty.\n\nThis powerful message of hope is delivered as a personal audience with one of the greatest living thinkers, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Tenzin Gyatso, known to billions around the world as the Dalai Lama.\n\nSpeaking as a member of our single global community, he shares practical wisdom for finding peace, compassion, and hope in the midst of chaos. With disarming clarity and deep humanity, he invites us to imagine—and help create—a world where compassion is activated as our strongest force for change, and happiness is within reach for everyone.\n\nIn WISDOM OF HAPPINESS, the Dalai Lama speaks directly to viewers, sharing his Tibetan wisdom, underscoring the oneness of humanity, and offering a message of hope and serenity in troubled times. He reflects on how each of us can overcome negative emotions and strengthen positive ones like love and compassion, opening the path to happier, more meaningful lives while contributing to a healthier and more harmonious future. He also emphasizes that the feminine principle of kindness and connection is urgently needed, even suggesting the next Dalai Lama may be female.\n\nThe film is a grand and immersive cinematic experience. The Dalai Lama guides us by asking how “modern” people can find peace of mind despite the stresses of daily life, the climate crisis, and the anxieties of ongoing wars. That inner calm, he reminds us, enables us to create peace and justice outwardly and to take action together.\n\nOne of the greatest living thinkers, the 14th Dalai Lama is now 90 years old and looks back on a life that has, perhaps unsurprisingly, been the subject of various Hollywood film productions. Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama’s full spiritual name, is one of the most well-known figures of our time. His tenure as the head of Tibetan Buddhists has lasted longer than the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, given that he was enthroned at the age of five.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "BCT & Bloomington Roots present a special Valentine concert: Over the Rhine ~ INFAMOUS LOVE SONGS ~\n\n“Some years ago, when Johnny Cash’s career was undergoing a resurgence during his creative collaborations with producer, Rick Rubin, someone made an attempt to organize Johnny’s songs into three categories: God, Love and Death. It occurred to me then that maybe those are the only three subjects available to the writer. I have tried to write about all three.\n\nAnd yet, one night over a late night beverage, by way of confession, I admitted to a colleague (a fellow songwriter) that I was embarrassed by the possibility that every song I had ever written was essentially a love song.\n\nWithout missing a beat he responded, Well, maybe, but you don’t just write about falling in love: you write about what happens further down the road.\n\nI was relieved and grateful to receive that perspective, because ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed further down the road. Karin and I have been writing, and making records together as Over the Rhine for 35 years. We’ve been married for 29 of those. Long live musical couples. Johnny and June might be our patron saints, but they are not the only ones. A significant swath of our favorite music over the years has been made by that rare and endangered breed of exotic zoo animal: the musical couple. (The list includes Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Buddy and Julie Miller, Richard and Linda Thompson, The Innocence Mission and others.) But back to further down the road… Poet Christina Rosetti famously wrote the lines: Does the road wind uphill all the way? Yes, to the very end.\n\nFew things in life get easier as the years pass. But from this vantage point, after 35 years of climbing, we can see the broader view. We can see the two songwriters who were stoned on love and words and possibility. We can see the couple who almost called it a day, and yet found their way into — and with — each other. We learned that we tend two separate gardens: the garden of our career in music, and the garden of our life together well apart from the noise of the music industry.\n\nWe know well the thrill of opening shows for Bob Dylan or Lucinda Williams, getting to play at Newport Folk Festival, or in Japan, or New Zealand. And checking those things off our dream list was indeed a thrill. Seeing the world on the backs of the songs. Watching a community coalesce around our music that crossed borders and boundaries.\n\nAnd now it is also the deeper abiding joy of quietly walking two Irish Wolfhounds in the cool of the evening. At home. Being together. The fact that we can still make each other laugh. Sharing a story that’s still being written. We live together on a small farm, grow songs, host concerts in the restored barn, and curate and host Nowhere Else Festival — our very own music and arts festival, the festival that we were always looking for but never quite found until we built it ourselves. Both/and.\n\nWe have written a lifetime of love songs in all shapes and sizes. We were curious as to what an evening devoted entirely to the possibilities of love songs might feel like. And so, come Valentine’s Day, we’re going to go find a few favorite stages, and find out. We hope you’ll join us.”\n\nLinford Detweiler (w/Karin Bergquist close by)\nSeptember 2025, Martinsville, Ohio\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

The featured composers include Bobby Hutcherson, Jackie McLean, Stanley Cowell, Harold Land, Joe Chambers, Duke Pearson, and James Spaulding. Remarkably, much of this music, created during a period of significant social change and civil unrest, remained unreleased for decades, preventing these compositions from being heard when they were originally written.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Get out there with spontaneous acts of generosity, compassion, and goodwill for others with the goal of spreading joy and positivity. And then bring your loved ones and family to see this fantastically warm Pixar film, “Up” for $5 each.\n\nCarl Fredricksen, a retired balloon salesman and widower, is part rascal, part dreamer and ready for his last chance at high-flying excitement. Tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets off to South America and the lost world of his childhood dreams in order to fulfill a promise that he made to his late wife. But unbeknownst to curmudgeon Carl, an overeager 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer who has never ventured beyond his backyard is in the wrong place at the wrong time… Carl’s front porch.\n\nThe world’s most unlikely duo reach new heights and meet fantastic friends like Dug, a dog with a special collar that allows him to speak, and Kevin, a rare 13-foot-tall flightless bird. Stuck together in the wilds of the jungle, Carl realizes that sometimes life’s biggest adventures aren’t the ones you set out to have.\n\nReviewers say “Up” is an emotional and imaginative film exploring love, loss, and adventure, and praise its poignant storytelling and opening sequence.\n\nRATED: PG\nFORMAT: DCP\nLENGTH: 1hr 40min\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

After being arrested for throwing an illegal rave to generate rent money, her librarian aunt Judy bails her out. To pay her back, Mary has to work at her local New York Public Library branch, as far away a profession from her party-girl lifestyle as she can imagine. But amid the books, card catalogues, and databases, she starts to realize her hidden talents, all while falling for Omar, her local street food vendor, and trying to (finally) grow up. We’ll take a falafel with hot sauce, a side order of baba ghanoush, and a seltzer. [94 min; comedy, romance; English]\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Georgi M. Unkovski's debut feature is a delightfully inspiring tale as old as time, told in a romantic and rebellious new way. A devoted shepherd longing for more than green pastures and the bleating of his faithful herd, Ahmet enlists his younger brother Naim to help him capture the attention (and hopefully, affections) of village beauty Aya, who is begrudgingly betrothed to another. Did we mention there's a banging soundtrack and neon pink sheep to move the plot along? Winner of the Sundance World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for Creative Vision.

    "description": "Songwriter Vienna Teng re-emerges this fall with her mashup song pair We’ve Got You – her first new music in over a decade – but her fans have been here the whole time.\n\nThey’ve packed concert venues even in years between releases, crowdfunded an ambitious music video in hours, and joined by the hundreds when she launched her “music x climate action” Patreon in 2022.\n\nThat kind of devotion has poured forth since 2002’s Waking Hour, which landed her on NPR’s Weekend Edition, The Late Show with David Letterman, and the top of Amazon’s music charts. Across four more studio albums that followed – the chamber folk of Warm Strangers, the jazz-inflected Dreaming Through the Noise, the indie epic Inland Territory, the bright electro-pop in Aims – Vienna has paid homage to her genre-bending heroes like Paul Simon and Tori Amos, while carving a path all her own. Together with her captivating live performances and thoughtful online presence, her work has built a loyal following across generations and continents.\n\nVienna’s new mini-EP We’ve Got You reflects the complexity of her life over the past decade: climate change work, community building, parenthood. Two songs, each titled “We’ve Got You,” act like fraternal twins: one an indie-pop tribute to inspiring leaders, the other a chamber-folk paean to unsung caregivers. Played simultaneously, they reveal a new intricate whole: a mashup by design, and a love letter to social movements.\n\nAppropriately, Vienna now also hosts climate action workshops on tour and online, which participants have described as “rocket fuel” and “the perfect antidote to despair.”\n\nIt’s an exciting new chapter in the ever-evolving love story between an artist and her audience.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

They created much of what the billion dollar NBA is today–the 3-point shot, slam dunk contest, fashion and culture innovators–but then are forgotten in a business deal gone bad.\n\nThe Waiting Game is a powerful documentary that reveals an incredible battle between the NBA and a tiny not-for-profit working to gain full recognition for the men of the ABA. It’s a fight for benefits the players of the ABA felt were promised, but never delivered. While following an investigation of the legal trail of the ABA-NBA merger, key impact journalism and the advocacy for justice, the film reveals the lines that can stand between raw corporate interest and basic human dignity.\n\n“I’m an ABA guy. I got my start there. This is a very important film with a genuine hero at the center.” Bob Costas\n\n“This is the REAL story of the guys I played with and the league that was so important to all of us. It made me cry and it made me proud. I want EVERYONE to see this.” “Dr Dunk” Darnell Hillman, 3-time ABA Champion, Winner of first NBA Slam Dunk Contest\n\n“Here’s me explicitly asking you to please watch Michael Husain’s documentary as soon as possible and recommend it to your nearest NBA fanatic so that they can raise their voice for the legends associated with the ABA.” Pramit Chatterjee, Rotten Tomato Reviewer\n\nRATING: N/A\nLENGTH: 1hr 30min\nFORMAT: DCP\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "“THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE CELTIC REALM” – The Boston Globe\n\n“A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN” and “THE BEST TRADITIONAL IRISH BAND” – Dolly Parton on her collaboration with Altan on two of her albums Heartsongs (1994) and Little Sparrow (2001)\n\nThe spirit and sound of Altan comes from the deep and rich musical tradition of their native Co. Donegal. On one of his many visits to the Donegal Gaeltacht of Gaoth Dobhair, Belfast born flute player Frankie Kennedy met fiddler and singer Mairead Ní Mhaonaigh, sparking off a deep musical connection, marriage in 1981, and a journey that took them all over the world. Their vision was to bring the unique repertoire of Donegal music to the world and that mission is still as strong as ever.\n\nIn the mid 80s, Mairead and Frankie recruited bouzouki player Ciaran Curran from Fermanagh, whose intricate counterpoint is at the center of the Altan sound, and guitarist Mark Kelly from Dublin, whose mastery of a wide palette of guitar styles and harmonic vocabulary add a breadth and depth of color. As a band, Altan played their first concert on June 1st 1985, in St. John’s Church in Listowel, Co. Kerry at the famous Listowel Writers Week.\n\nTheir first album, simply titled Altan was released in 1987 and quickly followed by Horse with A Heart, which saw the inclusion of Paul O’Saughnessy on fiddle. Paul had joined the band on its first US tours, lending his stunning virtuosity and in-depth knowledge of the Donegal style. He performed on the subsequent three albums. In 1992, the album Harvest Storm brought with it Dáithí Sproule on guitar, himself one of the pioneers of guitar in Irish traditional and folk music, having played with the wonderful Skara Brae with the O’Domhnaill family and Buncrana native Ciaran Tourish who excelled in fiery counterpoint fiddle.\n\nOne of the band’s finest hours came with the release of Island Angel in 1993, which was recognized by Billboard World Music Charts as the second biggest selling world music album globally in 1994 and in the same year, Altan performed for Bill Clinton at the White House. The band would play for US Presidents over the course of their career as well as accompanying Irish Presidents on their state visits. Shortly after the release of this album, the legendary accordionist Dermot Byrne joined the band.\n\nSadly, on September 19th,1994, the band and wider world of music was dealt a devastating blow with the death of founding member Frankie Kennedy. His vision, artistry and sense of fun is still at the heart of Altan and his legacy is carried and celebrated in every note. A record deal with Virgin Records followed in 1996, which catapulted the band on an extensive touring schedule over the subsequent decade. This period saw them working with many of the great American performers such as Dolly Parton, recording on her album Heartsongs (1994) and its follow up, Little Sparrow 2001; she returned the favor on the band’s record The Blue Idol in 2002 by dieting with Mairéad on the song The Pretty Young Girl. The band have traveled with Ireland’s President Mary MacAleese and President Michael D. Higgins on state visits abroad to Japan, North Korea and Italy. President Higgins invited them to join him in his residence, Aras an Uachtaraá in in 2018 to celebrate their 30 years as a band. The Donegal County Council held a civic reception in their offices to mark the occasion in May 2018. In 2006 the Irish Government also honored Altan by putting them on an official postal stamp to celebrate their contribution to the Irish culture one of the highest honors to be bestowed on an Irish citizen.\n\nMartin Tourish a past TG4 Young Musician of the Year, took the accordion seat in late 2013 and the band recorded their album The Widening Gyre in Nashville with many of the great Bluegrass and American performers, such as Mary Chapin Carpenter, Jerry Douglas and Alison Brown. This album explored the connections between Irish and Bluegrass music, a particularly special moment of which was performing at The Grand Ole Opry with Ricky Skaggs in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, the band released their first book, Altan: The Tunes, based on a collection of 222 melodies that they collected recorded over their 30 year history. Martin Tourish transcribed the dance music and meticulously interviewed all the band members for additional stories and background information. Containing a detailed commentary on each of the tunes, it is the only collection of Donegal music currently in print.\n\nMairead Ní Mhaonaigh was awarded Donegal Person of the Year in 2008 and the coveted TG4 Gradaim Ceoil (Music Award) 2017, for her musicianship and singing. The highest accolade which a traditional musician can receive in Ireland.\n\nIn celebration of the band’s latest album, The Gap of Dreams, the band has brought their music all over Europe and Ireland, the US and Canada, Japan, Australia and even North Africa. The latest album celebrates the roots of their music in Donegal folklore. It was recorded in the Attica Studios in the mountains of Donegal which contributed to a wonderful atmosphere which permeated throughout the recording. The title refers to that ‘gap’ or ‘door’ between this and the ‘other world.’ The older fiddlers , whom they got their music from, always associated with the “other world” as the source for their music and inspiration. They would describe poetically about encountering the fairy folk or listening to tunes on the wind or on the shore listening to the sound of the waves.\n\nIn creativity the ‘Gap of Dreams” is never shut. http://www.altan.ie/\n\nwww.facebook.com/altanofficial https://www.facebook.com/altanofficial\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

    "description": "Stavros Halkias is a comedian, actor, and writer from Baltimore, Maryland, now based in New York City. He most recently wrote, produced, and starred in the indie comedy Let’s Start a Cult. His latest stand-up special, Fat Rascal, is streaming on Netflix, following his debut special Live at the Lodge Room, which hit one million views in its first four days and has since surpassed seven million.\n\nOne of the most in-demand touring comedians today, Halkias is currently on The Dreamboat Tour. His podcast Stavvy’s World debuted at #3 on the iTunes Comedy Charts, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers in its first year. He will soon appear in Yorgos Lanthimos’ Bugonia, premiering at the Venice Film Festival, and in A24’s Tony, a film about Anthony Bourdain. He also stars in the Netflix comedy series Tires, bringing his quick wit and offbeat charm to television audiences.\n\nA founding member and former co-host of the hit podcast Cum Town (2016–2022), Halkias has also been featured in Steven Soderbergh’s sci-fi series Command Z. Outside of comedy, he made his runway debut at KidSuper’s Paris Fashion Week show in 2023, earning Vogue’s nod as “the plus-est of plus-size models.” His ultimate dream? Get just famous enough to buy his mother a nice home—then retire from show business to open a surf-and-turf restaurant in East Baltimore.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

A pulpy adventure inspired by the films of John Hughes and Rob Reiner, six teenagers set out on a cross-country journey through the Midwest to find their missing friend. As the miles pass, old tensions from the turbulent transition between high school and college resurface. Somewhere in between growing up and settling down, a backdrop of summer crickets, endless blue skies, and open roads, they confront their memories and missteps that shaped their drifting friendships.\n\n\nThis film is family friendly.

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "I’m just a Mississippi boy with a loud mouth and a big heart. I grew up believing in hard work, good friends, and telling it like it is, and I never really grew out of that. Most people know me from my comedy, where I’ve built a career on being unapologetically myself. Whether I’m on stage for the Not-So-Rich-And-Famous Tour, raising hell on social media, or telling stories that hit a little too close to home, I try to keep it real and keep people laughing.\n\nBut I’m more than just a comic. I run Triple B Outdoors, where I get to share my love for hunting, fishing, and the outdoors with folks who live for the same things I do. I’m engaged to the love of my life, and when I’m not on the road, you’ll find me in the woods, on the water, or working to grow my businesses.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m not trying to be famous, I’m just trying to be honest, entertain people, and maybe inspire a few along the way. If you stick around, you’ll get jokes, a little wisdom, and probably a few stories you wouldn’t want your grandma to hear.\n\nThis is an 18+ event.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "Hailed as “one of the best acoustic guitarists in the world” by NPR’s World Cafe, Tommy Emmanuel got his start at the age of six, when he first began touring his native Australia with his family’s band. As a teenager, he earned a reputation as a highly sought after sideman and session player, and by his early twenties, Emmanuel was playing on chart-topping hits and performing with acts like Air Supply and Men at Work. Inspired in part by his hero, Chet Atkins (who would later become a friend, mentor, and collaborator), Emmanuel stepped out on his own as a solo artist in 1979, releasing the first in a string of acclaimed instrumental albums that would make him an unlikely celebrity in his home country and beyond. In the decades that followed, he would go on to headline everywhere from the Sydney Opera House to Carnegie Hall; tour with luminaries like Eric Clapton and John Denver; win a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement; perform for a televised audience of more than two billion at the Sydney Olympics; and collaborate with a who’s who of fellow guitar greats, including Les Paul, Mark Knopfler, Joe Walsh, Richard Thompson, Jason Isbell, and Billy Strings.\n\n\nRecorded in just four days, Emmanuel’s latest album, Living In The Light, stands as the most daring—and most rewarding—collection in the globetrotting fingerpicker’s remarkable catalog, fusing his pop, jazz, classical, and roots influences into a virtuosic masterwork as exhilarating as it is intimate.\n\n\n\n\nTrey Hensley:\n\n\nGRAMMY® winner and reigning two-time IBMA Guitar Player of the Year Trey Hensley has been called a “musical phenom” by NPR, “a guitar-slinging superhero” by Bluegrass Today, “Nashville’s hottest young player” by Acoustic Guitar magazine, and “the Swiss Army knife of roots music” by WMOT Radio’s Craig Havighurst. Hensley’s artistry has received high praise from the likes of Merle Haggard and Marty Stuart. An Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival invitee who has collaborated with Johnny Cash, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, Taj Mahal and Tommy Emmanuel, Hensley is known for his other-worldly guitar playing, jaw-dropping musicianship and soulful storytelling. Having recently announced his signature guitar with Taylor Guitars, The Trey Hensley Gold Label 510e. Hensley is set to release a new album, Can’t Outrun The Blues, on March 6, 2026. The title cut has spent multiple weeks at #1 on the bluegrass charts.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",
