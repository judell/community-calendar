 orge Dom - Executive\, Former Navy Blue Angels Flight Leader\, Leadership 
 Speaker\, Author\, Sponsored by Intellisoft\n\nHigh-Trust Leadership and T
 eamwork\nIn the knowledge-based economy\, high performance is all about re
 lationships\, strong and enduring relationships with all stakeholders\, an
 d the fundamental ingredient for every successful relationship is trust.\n
 \nFor naval aviators\, flying off aircraft carriers a thousand miles from 
 land (often in the middle of the night) trust is essential not just for su
 ccess\, but survival. There can be no compromise in that extreme laborator
 y of high performance. If you weren’t trusted\, you’d fail or be fired
 \; if you can’t trust others\, you’ll either fail or look for another 
 line of work.\n\nTrust is the cornerstone to being an effective leader\; i
 t’s the glue that keeps the team firing on all cylinders. Within a cultu
 re of trust\, there is an upward spiral of achievement based on creativity
 \, determination\, accountability\, excellence\, passion\, camaraderie\, h
 umor\, candor\, and resilience. Allowing a culture of mistrust due to fear
 \, incompetence\, and/or integrity gaps will result in the opposite.\n\nTa
 ke-aways:\nUnderstand why a culture of HIGH-TRUST is critical to achieving
  individual and organizational high performance\nDiscover the 5C’s of tr
 ustworthiness: Character\, Commitment\, Competence\, Connection\, and Comm
