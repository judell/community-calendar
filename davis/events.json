    "description": "Category: Workshops and Training\n\nJoin us for this case study from a Research Librarian Beth Tweedy at UC Davis, who used 'low-stakes' data to learn high-stakes research tools!\n\nLearning new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can feel risky when you are working with critical research data. It started when I was daydreaming at work about my Dungeons & Dragons campaign and realized the best way to learn these tools (for me) was to take the \"work\" out of the equation. Join me for a case study on how I used a personal D&D database as a \"sandbox\" to learn high-impact data skills. By working with data I knew intimately (and didn't mind breaking), I was able to experiment with AI tools, fail safely, and eventually build a working automated pipeline. This isn't a talk about being a coding genius; it's about how a librarian harnessed curiosity and personal passion to gain a better understanding of how these often intimidating black-box tools actually work.\n\n \n\nThis session is designed for:\n\nResearchers, Scholars, and Practitioners interested in \"Ground Truth\" testing — using known data to safely audit the strengths, weaknesses, and limits of AI tools before trusting them with your scholarship.Librarians who want a practical look at how a researcher might approach the steep learning curve of this landscape. This session offers a viable path for building the technical vocabulary to translate user needs to technical experts/developers as well as applying these skills to your own work.Technical Experts & Data Scientists who support research. By watching a \"research hacker\" navigate the messy reality of AI integration, you will see how users who \"know enough to be dangerous\" actually approach these problems, offering insights on how to better anticipate pitfalls and guide the campus community. \n\nThis workshop is offered as part of UC Love Data Week. Advance registration required.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

    "description": "Category: Workshops and Training\n\nIf a picture tells a thousand words then a data visualization can convey a million! Join us to learn how to apply data visualization principles and best practices to generate compelling plots with ggplot in R. Through a series of case studies, we'll make static plots and practice iterating to improve upon them and the data stories they tell.\n\nThis workshop is for current R users who want to expand their plotting skills, and thus is not an introduction to the R programming langauge. It is part of DataLab's \"Intermediate R\" training series, which you can learn more about on our training website.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this workshop, learners should be able to:\n\n* write code to generate plots in R using the ggplot2 package\n\n* develop various different plot types (dot plots, histograms, bar charts, boxplots, time series, etc.)\n\n* employ ggplot's grammar of graphics syntax to customize plots,\n\n* effectively use layers and aesthetics to make plots more informative and meaningful (including adding groupings, scaling, color, faceting, labels, and trendlines)\n\n \n\nThis workshop is offered in person and as a virtual broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. Local learners are encouraged to attend in person. All members of the University of California system are welcome to register. Advance registration required.\n\n \n\n \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis and the other UCs who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

    "description": "The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) represents a landmark moment in the presentation of ancient Egyptian civilization to the world. Beyond its monumental scale, the museum invites renewed reflection on how ancient Egyptians understood beauty, harmony, and meaning in art.\n\n\n\nThis public lecture explores the aesthetic principles that shaped ancient Egyptian art, including balance, proportion, symbolism, material selection, and visual order. Rather than viewing ancient artworks as isolated objects, the talk explains how they were part of a broader cultural and religious system in which beauty was closely connected to ideas of permanence, divine order, and cosmic harmony. \n\nUsing selected examples of sculpture, reliefs, and architectural elements, the lecture discusses how these aesthetic values are now reinterpreted through modern museum display practices at the Grand Egyptian Museum. By connecting ancient artistic intentions with contemporary exhibition approaches, the lecture highlights how ancient Egyptian art continues to communicate meaning and cultural identity today. The talk will be given by Ahmad Hussein, PhD.\n\nSource: Yolo Library",

Drawing on archival research, oral histories and site visits, he traces how past detonations continue to shape public memory and geography.\n Bettina Ng’weno, professor of African American and African Studies, shares from No Place Like Home in a New City, an intimate account of how residents of Nairobi resist anti-urban ideologies to build life, belonging and new urban futures amid rapid redevelopment. \n\n\nCovered: Spotlighting Faculty Authors in Letters and Science is co-sponsored by the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum and the UC Davis Library.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

    "description": "Category: Workshops and Training\n\nCleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions?

    "description": "Category: Workshops and Training\n\nThis is the second session of a 2-part workshop. To attend, register for the workshop series and attend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

The retreat will be a unique opportunity for student-scholars to build community, explore identity, and share experiences/knowledge.

You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provides an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nThe series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provide an overview of HPC terminology, architecture, and general workflows, and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transfer files, how to install software with miniconda, how to reserve computing time and run programs with SLURM, and execute shell commands that are especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice accessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facility’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learners must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day, with a break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series, learners should be able to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server;Transfer files to and from a server;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server;Use SLURM to run interactive and non-interactive software on a server;Explain etiquette for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Command Line” workshop, or have equivalent prior experience using command line. Specifically, you will need to know how to use command line to navigate your file system and inspect, create, edit and move files. Participants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Python, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e., able to navigate and create, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register for a HPC account during the session.
