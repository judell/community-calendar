    "description": "The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) represents a landmark moment in the presentation of ancient Egyptian civilization to the world. Beyond its monumental scale, the museum invites renewed reflection on how ancient Egyptians understood beauty, harmony, and meaning in art.\n\n\n\nThis public lecture explores the aesthetic principles that shaped ancient Egyptian art, including balance, proportion, symbolism, material selection, and visual order. Rather than viewing ancient artworks as isolated objects, the talk explains how they were part of a broader cultural and religious system in which beauty was closely connected to ideas of permanence, divine order, and cosmic harmony. \n\nUsing selected examples of sculpture, reliefs, and architectural elements, the lecture discusses how these aesthetic values are now reinterpreted through modern museum display practices at the Grand Egyptian Museum. By connecting ancient artistic intentions with contemporary exhibition approaches, the lecture highlights how ancient Egyptian art continues to communicate meaning and cultural identity today. The talk will be given by Ahmad Hussein, PhD.\n\nSource: Yolo Library",

Professor Atuahene will share stories from her research, offer insights, and engage the audience in an interactive discussion about racial justice, housing, and policy. This event is designed to foster reflection, dialogue, and a deeper understanding of the systemic forces shaping Black homeownership.\n\nBernadette Atuahene is a Harvard and Yale-trained property law scholar whose work focuses on land and homes stolen from Black people. She currently holds the Duggan Chair at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. Atuahene has served as a judicial clerk at the South African Constitutional Court, worked as a consultant for the South African Land Claims Commission, and practiced at a global law firm called Cleary Gottlieb. She is the author of We Want What’s Ours: Learning from South Africa’s Land Restitution Program, and she directed and produced an award-winning short documentary film about one South African family’s struggle to regain their land. Atuahene has won several accolades and has published extensively in both academic journals and news outlets such as the New York Times and LA Times.\n\nSource: Yolo Library\n\nSource: Yolo Library",
