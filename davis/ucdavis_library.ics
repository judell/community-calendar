DESCRIPTION:Category: Workshops and Training\n\nThis intermediate R worksh
 op is all about making it easier to run\, reuse\, and share R code by impr
 oving your scripts!\n\n \n\nWe'll cover what scripts are\, how to organize
  code in a script\, how to make scripts executable\, how to handle inputs 
 and outputs\, and how to reuse functions from one script in another. In or
 der to make sure you and others you share your scripts with can run them\,
  we'll also cover how to manage installed packages and their versions with
  R's built-in functions and the "renv" package. The workshop will end with
  a brief discussion of what to do next if you want to turn your scripts in
 to fully-fledged R packages.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this workshop\, lear
 ners should be able to:\n\n– Create executable R scripts\;\n– Organize
  scripts according to best practices\;\n– Modify scripts to accept input
  via command line arguments\;\n– Modify code to log output to the consol
 e or a file\;\n– Create loops to run repetitive or iterative code\;\n–
  Use R's built-in functions to maintain installed packages\;\n– Use the 
 "renv" package to control package versions\;\n\n \n\nThis workshop is offe

 ites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains 
 at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus\, we won't cove
 r introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be com
 fortable with basic R syntax\, and have the latest version of R and RStudi

DESCRIPTION:Category: Workshops and Training\n\nJoin us for this case stud
 y from a Research Librarian Beth Tweedy at UC Davis\, who used 'low-stakes
 ' data to learn high-stakes research tools!\n\nLearning new technologies l
 ike Artificial Intelligence (AI) can feel risky when you are working with 
 critical research data. It started when I was daydreaming at work about my
  Dungeons & Dragons campaign and realized the best way to learn these tool
 s (for me) was to take the "work" out of the equation. Join me for a case 
 study on how I used a personal D&D database as a "sandbox" to learn high-i
 mpact data skills. By working with data I knew intimately (and didn't mind
  breaking)\, I was able to experiment with AI tools\, fail safely\, and ev
 entually build a working automated pipeline. This isn't a talk about being
  a coding genius\; it's about how a librarian harnessed curiosity and pers
 onal passion to gain a better understanding of how these often intimidatin
 g black-box tools actually work.\n\n \n\nThis session is designed for:\n\n
 Researchers\, Scholars\, and Practitioners interested in "Ground Truth" te
 sting — using known data to safely audit the strengths\, weaknesses\, an
 d limits of AI tools before trusting them with your scholarship.Librarians
  who want a practical look at how a researcher might approach the steep le
 arning curve of this landscape. This session offers a viable path for buil
 ding the technical vocabulary to translate user needs to technical experts
 /developers as well as applying these skills to your own work.Technical Ex
 perts & Data Scientists who support research. By watching a "research hack
 er" navigate the messy reality of AI integration\, you will see how users 
 who "know enough to be dangerous" actually approach these problems\, offer
 ing insights on how to better anticipate pitfalls and guide the campus com
 munity. \n\nThis workshop is offered as part of UC Love Data Week. Advance
  registration required.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datalab-training@ucdavi

DESCRIPTION:Category: Workshops and Training\n\nIf a picture tells a thous
 and words then a data visualization can convey a million! Join us to learn
  how to apply data visualization principles and best practices to generate
  compelling plots with ggplot in R. Through a series of case studies\, we'
 ll make static plots and practice iterating to improve upon them and the d
 ata stories they tell.\n\nThis workshop is for current R users who want to
  expand their plotting skills\, and thus is not an introduction to the R p
 rogramming langauge. It is part of DataLab's "Intermediate R" training ser
 ies\, which you can learn more about on our training website.\n\n \n\nAfte
 r completing this workshop\, learners should be able to:\n\n* write code t
 o generate plots in R using the ggplot2 package\n\n* develop various diffe
 rent plot types (dot plots\, histograms\, bar charts\, boxplots\, time ser
 ies\, etc.)\n\n* employ ggplot's grammar of graphics syntax to customize p
 lots\,\n\n* effectively use layers and aesthetics to make plots more infor
 mative and meaningful (including adding groupings\, scaling\, color\, face
 ting\, labels\, and trendlines)\n\n \n\nThis workshop is offered in person
  and as a virtual broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. Local learners a
 re encouraged to attend in person. All members of the University of Califo
 rnia system are welcome to register. Advance registration required.\n\n \n
 \n \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners f
 rom all domains at UC Davis and the other UCs who want to hone their exist
 ing R skills. Thus\, we won't cover introductory R questions during this s
 ession. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax\, and have 
 the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their lap
 tops. If you're new to R\, or want to brush up\, we suggest you start with
  our "R Basics" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Ma
 terials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's w
 ebsite. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Category: Workshops and Training\n\nCleaning your data is ofte
 n the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for re
 searchers using R\, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexi
 ties of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n 
 \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with str
 ucture and data types\, and write scripts to effectively convert and corre
 ct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of "tidy data\," ensuring yo
 ur datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. 
 Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing
 \, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also l
 earn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\
 n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand\, scraping the web\, or
  importing text files\, this training will help expand your R coding skill
 s to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproduc
 ibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training\, learners should be able 
 to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R\;  Ide
 ntify and convert features to appropriate data types\;Use the “stringr
 ” package clean and extract data from text\;Use regular expressions to d
 escribe patterns in text\; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates 
 and times\;Identify features of a "tidy" dataset\;Describe the advantages 
 and disadvantages of tidy data\;Use the "tidyr" package to reshape data\;D
 escribe what a join is\;Compare differences between an inner join and left
  join\;Use the "dplyr" package to join two data sets on a common column\;a
 nd learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person
  only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registrati
 on required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19\,
  2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26\, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequ
 isites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domain
 s at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus\, we won't co
 ver introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be c
 omfortable with basic R syntax\, and have the latest version of R and RStu
 dio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R\, or wa
 nt to brush up\, we suggest you start with our "R Basics" workshop curricu
 lum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis Data
 Lab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop s

DESCRIPTION:Category: Workshops and Training\n\nThis is the second session
  of a 2-part workshop. To attend\, register for the workshop series and at
 tend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part o
 f research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R\, we will move
  past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn 
 effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to effici
 ently identify potential problems with structure and data types\, and writ
 e scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss t
 he principles of "tidy data\," ensuring your datasets are structured perfe
 ctly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive in
 to the stringr package for text processing\, and the lubridate package for
  handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr 
 to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering
  your data by hand\, scraping the web\, or importing text files\, this tra
 ining will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysi
 s-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completin
 g this training\, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to det
 ermine how best to load them into R\;  Identify and convert features to ap
 propriate data types\;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data
  from text\;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text\; Use the
  “lubridate” package to parse dates and times\;Identify features of a 
 "tidy" dataset\;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data\;Us
 e the "tidyr" package to reshape data\;Describe what a join is\;Compare di
 fferences between an inner join and left join\;Use the "dplyr" package to 
 join two data sets on a common column\;and learn where to go to learn more
 ! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are
  welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend
  both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19\, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: Februa
 ry 26\, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intende
 d for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone the
 ir existing R skills. Thus\, we won't cover introductory R questions durin
 g this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax\, a
 nd have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on t
 heir laptops. If you're new to R\, or want to brush up\, we suggest you st
 art with our "R Basics" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this e
 vent? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on Dat
 aLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainin

SUMMARY:Introduction to Remote Computing and HPC (2-day workshop)
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20260317

UID:708be672ffae129f822da38f193f3709@events.library.ucdavis.edu
DESCRIPTION:Category: Workshops and Training\n\nAre you working on a resea
 rch project but finding that your data is too big for your laptop\, or tha
 t your code must run for a long time? You need more compute power!\n \n\nT
 his 2-day intensive workshop provides an introduction to accessing and com
 puting on remote servers such as UC Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster
 ) to elevate your research. \n \n\nThe series covers everything you need t
 o know to get started. We’ll provide an overview of HPC terminology\, ar
 chitecture\, and general workflows\, and guide learners through how to set
  up and use SSH to log in and transfer files\, how to install software wit
 h miniconda\, how to reserve computing time and run programs with SLURM\, 
 and execute shell commands that are especially useful for working with ser
 vers. As we learn we’ll practice accessing and computing on remote serve
 rs using the UC Davis HPC Core Facility’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\n
 The material builds and thus learners must attend both days. Sessions run 
 from 10 AM - 4 PM each day\, with a break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this work
 shop series\, learners should be able to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server
 \;Transfer files to and from a server\;Set up and use conda/mamba to insta
 ll software on a server\;Use SLURM to run interactive and non-interactive 
 software on a server\;Explain etiquette for using a server cluster such as
  Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to cancellation if minimum enrollment is 
 not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nParticipants should have taken DataLa
 b’s “Introduction to the Unix Command Line” workshop\, or have equiv
 alent prior experience using command line. Specifically\, you will need to
  know how to use command line to navigate your file system and inspect\, c
 reate\, edit and move files. Participants must be comfortable with program
 ming in a language such as R or Python\, and with basic Linux shell syntax
  (i.e.\, able to navigate and create\, modify and move files via command l
 ine).\n \n\nLearners will register for a HPC account during the session. C
 AS authentication is required.\n\n\nCan't make it to this training? Check 
 out our workshop schedule. Materials from prior workshops are available on
  DataLab's website.\n \n\nQuestions? Email datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.\n
