UID:1e3f0a0c051fae1829deaddc1b84aac3@events.yolocountylibrary.org
DESCRIPTION:The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) represents
  a landmark moment in the presentation of ancient Egyptian civilization to
  the world. Beyond its monumental scale\, the museum invites renewed refle
 ction on how ancient Egyptians understood beauty\, harmony\, and meaning i
 n art.\n\n\n\nThis public lecture explores the aesthetic principles that s
 haped ancient Egyptian art\, including balance\, proportion\, symbolism\, 
 material selection\, and visual order. Rather than viewing ancient artwork
 s as isolated objects\, the talk explains how they were part of a broader 
 cultural and religious system in which beauty was closely connected to ide
 as of permanence\, divine order\, and cosmic harmony. \n\nUsing selected 
 examples of sculpture\, reliefs\, and architectural elements\, the lecture
  discusses how these aesthetic values are now reinterpreted through modern
  museum display practices at the Grand Egyptian Museum. By connecting anci
 ent artistic intentions with contemporary exhibition approaches\, the lect
 ure highlights how ancient Egyptian art continues to communicate meaning a
 nd cultural identity today. The talk will be given by Ahmad Hussein\, PhD
 .\n\nSource: Yolo Library
