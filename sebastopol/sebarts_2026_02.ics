  retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is 
 to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wanders. I

 onship with revision!Session Focus: Whole-body Characters We’ll explore 
 ways to create vivid people on the page and strengthen other elements thro
 ugh character\, including point of view\, sense of place\, and emotional r
 esonance.Revision is to a first draft what marriage is to falling head-ove
 r heels. It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Re
 vision takes time\, skill\, caring\, and fortitude. It asks that we be gen
 erous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge
  what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not fo
 r the faint of heart\, but for writers committed to their relationship wit
 h creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows write
 rs to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll sha
 re a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling\,” which incorporates 
 my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction\, memoir\, and nonfic
 tion. The session includes a craft presentation\, group discussion\, and w
