 the end of the workshop\, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but al
 so a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for t
 he art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your p
 ersonal story in your art\, Methods for sourcing interesting collage paper
 s\, Techniques for crafting textured\, multi-layered collages\, Strategies
  for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own 
 papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life
 \, copies of photos\, old letters\, books\, papers from memorable experien

   \n  \n\nWednesday\, March 4\, 2026\; 6-9PM$55 + $10 Materials FeeAges 16
 +In this one day introductory workshop\, participants will get a peek into
  the process of building one’s drawing abilities through developing clos
 e observational skills and learning fundamental drawing techniques. If you
  find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring\, you can sign up for 
 the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to pr
 actice and advance their drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t 
 practiced in years\, or any artists who just want to learn more and practi
 ce with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learni
 ng to see - a skill that anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Throu
 gh demonstration\, practice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will 
 explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure 
 environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of pract
 ical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of wha
 t one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if y
 ou feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply w
 ant to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the clas
 s for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts
  with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\
 , then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printm
 aking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected\,
  but her personal practice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, waterc
 olor\, mixed media\, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats
  (kids\, teens\, adults\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and man
 y mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but
  also enjoys teaching drawing\, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n

 0 – 5:30pm$15.00Max 18 Attendees\, Pre-registration required(We are unab
 le to offer refunds or transfers for this class. If you cannot attend\, pl
 ease consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” 
 offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffer
 ing we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can b
 e a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in 
 our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You 
 do not have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings 
 to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine
 " sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 year
 s. Her work has created an international community of people who\, by list
 ening to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and los
 s\, helped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on 
 our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a medit
 ation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditat
 e is to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wande
 rs. In poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart
  and along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. Wh
 en we witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness
 \, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a
  strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor
 : Judith Redwing Keyssar\, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in
  the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator\, end-of-life doula\,
  author\, poet\, song-writer\, ceremonialist\, national presenter and freq
 uent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. R
 edwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Educa
 tion in Palliative Care at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Her professional career includes
  being the Clinical Director at Zen Hospice Project and the Director of Pa
 lliative Care and Nursing at Jewish Family and Children’s Services from 
 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California S
 tate University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care\, and has taugh
 t courses at OLLI at Sonoma State. Redwing is the author of an award-winni
 ng book\, “Last Acts of Kindness\; Lessons for the Living from the Bedsi
 des of the Dying” and is the recipient of numerous awards in the field o
 f Palliative Care. After studying with John Fox at the Institute for Poeti
 c Medicine\, her passion for using poetry as a healing modality has led to
  the development of a successful international program in Poetic Medicine\
 , through her work at the UCSF MERI Center. Learn more about her here: htt

 0 – 5:30pm$15.00Max 18 Attendees\, Pre-registration required(We are unab
 le to offer refunds or transfers for this class. If you cannot attend\, pl
 ease consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” 
 offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffer
 ing we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can b
 e a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in 
 our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You 
 do not have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings 
 to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine
 " sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 year
 s. Her work has created an international community of people who\, by list
 ening to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and los
 s\, helped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on 
 our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a medit
 ation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditat
 e is to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wande
 rs. In poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart
  and along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. Wh
 en we witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness
 \, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a
  strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor
 : Judith Redwing Keyssar\, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in
  the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator\, end-of-life doula\,
  author\, poet\, song-writer\, ceremonialist\, national presenter and freq
 uent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. R
 edwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Educa

 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California S
 tate University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care\, and has taugh

 ng book\, “Last Acts of Kindness\; Lessons for the Living from the Bedsi
 des of the Dying” and is the recipient of numerous awards in the field o
 f Palliative Care. After studying with John Fox at the Institute for Poeti
