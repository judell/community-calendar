You will work on four small wood panels to compose a cohesive series. Working on several panels at once offers several advantages, including greater creative momentum, the ability to build a strong thematic connection between pieces, and a way to maintain creative flow.  This technique allows for a deeper exploration of an idea or theme than is possible with a single piece. We will start with short composition exercises to discuss design principles and abstraction.  Then Catherine will demonstrate her method for mounting papers on the panels.  You will have ample time to select papers and create your designs. What you’ll learn from this workshop: Reliable method for layering collage papers, Creative ways to explore abstraction, Techniques for creating a cohesive series, Strategies for refining your compositionIMPORTANT: Instructions for where to purchase your materials and how to prepare them is provided in the attached PDF. We will take a short break for lunch between 12:30 and 1:00 pm so please bring your lunch and a beverage.   About the instructor: Catherine Cruz is a French-American artist whose work is informed by textures and patterns created by the passing of time and the effects of the natural elements on the built environment.  She holds a Bachelor of Science in interior design and she worked in the field of architectural design and green building certification for over 25 years.  She has taught collage and mixed media workshops in the Bay Area and in France since 2019, and this is her fifth year at the Sebastopol Center for the Arts.

    "description": "The Occidental Laguna Sangha is a Zen Buddhist Sangha located in Sebastopol, California. Though our emphasis is primarily Zen we integrate mindfulness and other teachings from the Vipassana and Tibetan traditions into our practice. We believe that everything that comes our way is an opportunity for opening — our work in the world, our everyday tasks, our relationships — everything is an opportunity to practice the Bodhisattva ideals of mindfulness, compassion, generosity and kindness. \nWe meet every Sunday at the Youth Annex, Sebastopol Cultural Center from 9-10:30. By Donation ($15 suggested). The Guiding Teacher is Bruce Fortin with 50 years of meditation experience. \nOur name incorporates “Occidental,” as this is the town where we first started meeting together. The word also carries the meaning “Western,” where the Buddha Dharma is now being established. “Laguna” is where we currently meet and meditate together, right next to the beautiful Laguna de Santa Rosa in Sebastopol California. \nThe Sangha is respectful of all the teachings and schools of Buddhism and includes practitioners of all levels, from complete beginners to the very experienced. All are welcome to practice with us. \nThe guiding teacher for the Sangha is Bruce Fortin. He was ordained a Soto Zen Priest in the lineage of Suzuki Roshi in 1976 and has received Dharma Transmission to teach in that lineage. He has also studied with a number of other teachers in the Tibetan and Vipassana traditions and his teachings reflect their influence.\n\nSource: Sebastopol Community Center",

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor: Judith Redwing Keyssar, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator, end-of-life doula, author, poet, song-writer, ceremonialist, national presenter and frequent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. Redwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Education in Palliative Care at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Her professional career includes being the Clinical Director at Zen Hospice Project and the Director of Palliative Care and Nursing at Jewish Family and Children’s Services from 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California State University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care, and has taught courses at OLLI at Sonoma State. Redwing is the author of an award-winning book, “Last Acts of Kindness; Lessons for the Living from the Bedsides of the Dying” and is the recipient of numerous awards in the field of Palliative Care. After studying with John Fox at the Institute for Poetic Medicine, her passion for using poetry as a healing modality has led to the development of a successful international program in Poetic Medicine, through her work at the UCSF MERI Center.

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community.

    "description": "Divine Voice\nwith Kiranjot Kaur of Copper Wimmin\nIndian Classical Note Singing as a Meditation\non Sound and Presence\nWednesday at 7:30 – 9 pm (time may run over by 15 min)\nI believe that EVERYONE can sing and that we are each designed as divine instruments! \nIn the tradition of Indian Classical music we surrender to the practice, to music herself. It is a practice\nof letting go of who we think we are and any limitations we believe we have. \nIt is an exercise of becoming present and allowing music to move through like breath through a\nbeautiful flute. We can gently allow each note to brush the strings of our hearts instrument and\nbecome the voice of our soul. \nThis vocal practice works on breath support, intonation, vocal range, dexterity and tone, note\nrecognition, projection and presence. \nThis class is open to ALL no experience needed! We spend the first 45 minutes in a blissful call and\nresponse note singing practice and end with chanting and or a composition in a particular Raag (set of\nnotes). \nMy teacher, Dr.Ustad Narinder Singh Sandhu, taught me that: \n“You do not need to know anything about music to sing.\nYou do not need to have a beautiful voice or talent to sing.\nThe only thing that you need is love.” \nKiranjot Kaur is a vocalist, founding member of Copper Wimmin, Kundalini Yoga teacher, and Indian classical music instructor, with a deep devotion to the Divine Mother and A Course in Miracles. Copper Wimmin gained recognition through appearances on Democracy Now and the Showtime series The L Word, where their song “Bleeding Rivers” was featured. \nIn 2006, Kiranjot refocused her career toward Indian classical music, dedicating five years to living and studying under the tutelage of her beloved teacher, Dr. Ustad Narindar Singh, in Amritsar, India. Shifting away from traditional performances where the audience is separate from the performer, Kiranjot now merges her early experiences of communal singing with Sweet Honey in the Rock and Bobby McFerrin, alongside her deep love for Indian music and Kirtan traditions. \nIn 2014, Kiranjot was introduced to A Course in Miracles, and has since steadily integrated its daily lessons into her life. She now offers a unique blend of Indian classical notes and A Course in Miracles songs, sung in the Kirtan style of call and response. Kiranjot invites everyone to experience the transformative healing power of their own voice in the practice of singing together as ONE. \nFrom her journeys through India to Chile and back, Kiranjot has discovered her greatest joy is inspiring everyone regardless of their singing experience, to use their voices as a method for quieting the mind, surrendering to presence, and revolutionary self-love. \nFor more information please email: kiranjot@mantramamas.org \nFirst class: by donation\nDrop in class: $25 \n5 class stamp card: $100 (must be used within 8 weeks)\nClass pass card available in person at first class or online HERE\n\nSource: Sebastopol Community Center",

We invite participants to create a portrait of their beloved pet, under the guidance of an experienced Teaching Artist, with proceeds shared between SebArts and the Humane Society of Sonoma County. The event will blend creativity and compassion - core values shared by both organizations. Paint Your Pet is a 3 hour guided painting workshop where participants bring a photo of their pet (or choose from adoptable pets featured by the Humane Society) and learn to create a custom portrait using watercolor paint. Celebrate the human animal bond through art and creative expression while raising funds to support SebArts art programs and the Humane Society of Sonoma County’s animal care and adoption services.About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums.

It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Revision takes time, skill, caring, and fortitude. It asks that we be generous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not for the faint of heart, but for writers committed to their relationship with creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows writers to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll share a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling,” which incorporates my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction, memoir, and nonfiction. The session includes a craft presentation, group discussion, and writing time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful revision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revision• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind• Fiction or nonfiction free write, early draft, or manuscript in progress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and revision challenges to discuss, particularly as relate to the session focusThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each time. Check the schedule, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist, author, and strategic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolution: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and, for publication in 2027, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired her to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling, Nine Ways to Mastery, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their writing practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career, she’s found that resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resilience to teaching revision as a writing skill, as well as a practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

The word collage comes from the French verb coller, meaning \"to glue,\" and is all about merging various materials to tell a visual story. Much like our lives, which are shaped by countless moments and experiences, collage pieces bring together fragments that reveal hidden connections and untold narratives. In this class, you’ll reflect on what matters most to you and how that can be expressed through art. Catherine will help you release the need for perfection and trust your creative instincts. By the end of the workshop, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but also a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for the art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your personal story in your art, Methods for sourcing interesting collage papers, Techniques for crafting textured, multi-layered collages, Strategies for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life, copies of photos, old letters, books, papers from memorable experiences or travels, or documents that hold meaning. If you’re not comfortable using these documents, you should make color copies of them. For this process, it is also best to make laser copies of your photographs.Supplies provided by instructor: some collage papers, acrylic medium, brushesCLICK HERE TO READ DOCUMENT PRIOR TO PURCHASING CLASSAbout the instructor: Catherine Cruz is a French-American artist whose work is informed by the textures and patterns created by the passing of time and the effects of the natural elements on the built environment.

If you find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring, you can sign up for the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor: Judith Redwing Keyssar, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator, end-of-life doula, author, poet, song-writer, ceremonialist, national presenter and frequent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. Redwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Education in Palliative Care at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Her professional career includes being the Clinical Director at Zen Hospice Project and the Director of Palliative Care and Nursing at Jewish Family and Children’s Services from 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California State University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care, and has taught courses at OLLI at Sonoma State.

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community.

Each session will start with a demonstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces that might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are freeform coil pots, soft slab work, hard slab technique, a variety of sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping, carving and textural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips and glaze that will add color to the forms we create.About the Instructor: Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After his college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick, he ran a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Turkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-12 art, including Ceramics, Drawing, Photography, Design and Sculpture at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High School and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of these schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teachers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the experimental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help students explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

Each session will start with a demonstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces that might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are freeform coil pots, soft slab work, hard slab technique, a variety of sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping, carving and textural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips and glaze that will add color to the forms we create.About the Instructor: Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After his college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick, he ran a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Turkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-12 art, including Ceramics, Drawing, Photography, Design and Sculpture at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High School and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of these schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teachers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the experimental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help students explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebarts 2026 3",
