SUMMARY:ZEN & Heart Practices
DESCRIPTION:The Occidental Laguna Sangha is a Zen Buddhist Sangha located in Sebastopol\, California. Though our emphasis is primarily Zen we integrate mindfulness and other teachings from the Vipassana and Tibetan traditions into our practice. We believe that everything that comes our way is an opportunity for opening — our work in the world\, our everyday tasks\, our relationships — everything is an opportunity to practice the Bodhisattva ideals of mindfulness\, compassion\, generosity and kindness. \nWe meet every Sunday at the Youth Annex\, Sebastopol Cultural Center from 9-10:30. By Donation ($15 suggested). The Guiding Teacher is Bruce Fortin with 50 years of meditation experience. \nOur name incorporates “Occidental\,” as this is the town where we first started meeting together. The word also carries the meaning “Western\,” where the Buddha Dharma is now being established. “Laguna” is where we currently meet and meditate together\, right next to the beautiful Laguna de Santa Rosa in Sebastopol California. \nThe Sangha is respectful of all the teachings and schools of Buddhism and includes practitioners of all levels\, from complete beginners to the very experienced. All are welcome to practice with us. \nThe guiding teacher for the Sangha is Bruce Fortin. He was ordained a Soto Zen Priest in the lineage of Suzuki Roshi in 1976 and has received Dharma Transmission to teach in that lineage. He has also studied with a number of other teachers in the Tibetan and Vipassana traditions and his teachings reflect their influence.\n\nSource: Sebastopol Community Center

 consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offer
 s a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering w
 e experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a s
 alve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our h
 earts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do no
 t have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings to po
 ur through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine" ses
 sions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. He
 r work has created an international community of people who\, by listening
  to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and loss\, h
 elped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on our l
 ife paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation
  retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is 
 to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wanders. I
 n poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and 
 along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we
  witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness\, so
 mething magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a stro
 ng and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor: Jud

You absolutely do not have to look a certain way to show up to this class. Get your Danceypants on\, and learn new and retro moves to 80s\, 90s\, and 00s pop\, hip hop\, world music & more. \nWear comfy things you can move in (workout gear / clean sneakers / no jeans!) and bring a hair tie / water. \n$15 w/online registration\, $20 drop-in   |   18+   |   BEGINNERS WELCOME\n\nSource: Sebastopol Community Center

SUMMARY:Divine Voice
DESCRIPTION:Divine Voice\nwith Kiranjot Kaur of Copper Wimmin\nIndian Classical Note Singing as a Meditation\non Sound and Presence\nWednesday at 7:30 – 9 pm (time may run over by 15 min)\nI believe that EVERYONE can sing and that we are each designed as divine instruments! \nIn the tradition of Indian Classical music we surrender to the practice\, to music herself. It is a practice\nof letting go of who we think we are and any limitations we believe we have. \nIt is an exercise of becoming present and allowing music to move through like breath through a\nbeautiful flute. We can gently allow each note to brush the strings of our hearts instrument and\nbecome the voice of our soul. \nThis vocal practice works on breath support\, intonation\, vocal range\, dexterity and tone\, note\nrecognition\, projection and presence. \nThis class is open to ALL no experience needed! We spend the first 45 minutes in a blissful call and\nresponse note singing practice and end with chanting and or a composition in a particular Raag (set of\nnotes). \nMy teacher\, Dr.Ustad Narinder Singh Sandhu\, taught me that: \n“You do not need to know anything about music to sing.\nYou do not need to have a beautiful voice or talent to sing.\nThe only thing that you need is love.” \nKiranjot Kaur is a vocalist\, founding member of Copper Wimmin\, Kundalini Yoga teacher\, and Indian classical music instructor\, with a deep devotion to the Divine Mother and A Course in Miracles. Copper Wimmin gained recognition through appearances on Democracy Now and the Showtime series The L Word\, where their song “Bleeding Rivers” was featured. \nIn 2006\, Kiranjot refocused her career toward Indian classical music\, dedicating five years to living and studying under the tutelage of her beloved teacher\, Dr. Ustad Narindar Singh\, in Amritsar\, India. Shifting away from traditional performances where the audience is separate from the performer\, Kiranjot now merges her early experiences of communal singing with Sweet Honey in the Rock and Bobby McFerrin\, alongside her deep love for Indian music and Kirtan traditions. \nIn 2014\, Kiranjot was introduced to A Course in Miracles\, and has since steadily integrated its daily lessons into her life. She now offers a unique blend of Indian classical notes and A Course in Miracles songs\, sung in the Kirtan style of call and response. Kiranjot invites everyone to experience the transformative healing power of their own voice in the practice of singing together as ONE. \nFrom her journeys through India to Chile and back\, Kiranjot has discovered her greatest joy is inspiring everyone regardless of their singing experience\, to use their voices as a method for quieting the mind\, surrendering to presence\, and revolutionary self-love. \nFor more information please email: kiranjot@mantramamas.org \nFirst class: by donation\nDrop in class: $25 \n5 class stamp card: $100 (must be used within 8 weeks)\nClass pass card available in person at first class or online HERE\n\nSource: Sebastopol Community Center

  what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not fo

 +In this one day introductory workshop\, participants will get a peek into
  the process of building one’s drawing abilities through developing clos
 e observational skills and learning fundamental drawing techniques. If you
  find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring\, you can sign up for 
 the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to pr
 actice and advance their drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t 
 practiced in years\, or any artists who just want to learn more and practi
 ce with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learni
 ng to see - a skill that anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Throu
 gh demonstration\, practice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will 
 explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure 
 environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of pract
 ical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of wha
 t one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if y
 ou feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply w
 ant to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the clas
 s for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts
  with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\
 , then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printm
 aking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected\,
  but her personal practice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, waterc
 olor\, mixed media\, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats
  (kids\, teens\, adults\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and man
 y mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but
  also enjoys teaching drawing\, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n

 +In this one day introductory workshop\, participants will get a peek into
  the process of building one’s drawing abilities through developing clos
 e observational skills and learning fundamental drawing techniques. If you
  find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring\, you can sign up for 
 the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to pr
 actice and advance their drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t 
 practiced in years\, or any artists who just want to learn more and practi
 ce with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learni
 ng to see - a skill that anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Throu
 gh demonstration\, practice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will 
 explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure 
 environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of pract
 ical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of wha
 t one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if y
 ou feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply w
 ant to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the clas
 s for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts
  with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\
 , then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printm
 aking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected\,
  but her personal practice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, waterc
 olor\, mixed media\, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats
  (kids\, teens\, adults\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and man
 y mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but
  also enjoys teaching drawing\, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n

 ease consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” 
 offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffer
 ing we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can b
 e a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in 
 our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You 
 do not have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings 
 to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine
 " sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 year
 s. Her work has created an international community of people who\, by list
 ening to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and los
 s\, helped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on 
 our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a medit
 ation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditat
 e is to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wande
 rs. In poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart
  and along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. Wh
 en we witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness
 \, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a
  strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor
