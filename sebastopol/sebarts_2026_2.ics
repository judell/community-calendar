 Additional Child under 12: $20 + $5 Materials FeeIn this unique class we w
 ill explore the foundations of pop up design and paper cutting while creat
 ing one of a kind pop up valentines for loved ones. Students will learn fo
 undational “folds” for pop up elements and then create their own valen
 tines. Students can personalize basic designs that we will walk through st
 ep by step\, or dream up their own imaginative way to use the folds they h
 ave learned to create their own pop up design for their cards. With an int
 roduction to paper cutting technique\, students can expand on their design
 s and create something enchanting. Artists will have some multimedia optio
 ns if they wish to adorn their pop up elements and card pages (such as col
 ored pencils and markers)\, or may opt to let the cut paper speak for itse
 lf. In this one day workshop we will cover: the basic rules underlying pop
  up mechanics\, beginning pop up “folds”\, proper knife handling\, fou
 ndational paper cutting skills\, and the basics of pop up design. This cla
 ss is suitable for artists of all skill levels. All materials included. Ab

 asis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\, then attend

 vision takes time\, skill\, caring\, and fortitude. It asks that we be gen
 erous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge
  what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not fo
 r the faint of heart\, but for writers committed to their relationship wit
 h creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows write
 rs to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll sha
 re a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling\,” which incorporates 
 my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction\, memoir\, and nonfic
 tion. The session includes a craft presentation\, group discussion\, and w
