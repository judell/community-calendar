Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

    "description": "Cleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions?

    "description": "Location: DataLab Classroom - room 360 Shields Library\n \n\nDescription: In this workshop, participants will learn how to use several options for composing maps in R.\n \n\nAfter completing this chapter, learners should be able to: Apply popular mapping workflows to create maps with spatial data; assess which workflow works best in different situations; apply cartographic best practices to a map composition in R\n \n\nConcepts Covered: R, Cartography, Programming, Data Vizualization\n \n\nSpeaker: Michele Tobias\n\nMichele Tobias is a geospatial data scientist with a background in geospatial methods for ecology. Michele earned her PhD from UC Davis in Geography where she studied California’s sandy beach ecosystem with traditional phytosociological methods and innovative remote sensing tools and was a postdoc at the UC Davis Information Center for the Environment. In her current position as a geospatial data scientist at UC Davis DataLab, she applies geospatial tools to new avenues of research across disciplines.\n \n\nPrerequisites: For the best experience, we recommend learners have the following skills before taking this workshop: an introductory understanding of programming in R (for example, you are familiar with how to load libraries, load common data formats like a CSV, and are comfortable running basic commands). See DataLab’s R Basics Workshop for help; an introductory understanding of spatial data (for example, you are familiar with the difference between raster and vector data). See DataLab’s ,a href=\"https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_spatial_data_formats/\">Spatial Data Formats Workshop for help; (recommended) review the concepts (first section) of DataLab’s Cartography for Academic Publications Workshop.\n \n\nSoftware Required: To fully participate in this workshop, learners should download and install R and RStudio on their laptop before the workshop begins.\n \n\nPlease RSVP.",

    "description": "This is the second session of a 2-part workshop. To attend, register for the workshop series and attend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions?

This is a drop-in program for ages 5-12. No registration in advance is required, but space and supplies are limited to the first 25 participants and are available on a first come, first served basis.\n\nWhen you arrive, pay with cash or card at the front desk.

We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

    "description": "Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're still active**, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

    "description": "Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're still active**, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses.

Materson, associate professor of history, traces civil rights activist Ruth Reynolds’ deep involvement in the movement for Puerto Rico’s independence in Radical Solidarity, offering a nuanced account of political allyship, anti-colonial struggle and cross-racial collaboration. \n Corrie Decker, associate professor of history, examines how colonial courts and ethnographers in 20th century East Africa transformed complex rites of passage into simplified “puberty rites\" in The Age of Sex: Custom, Law, and Ritual in Twentieth-Century East Africa, reshaping legal understandings of childhood, adulthood, gender and sexual maturity. \n \n\nCovered: Spotlighting Faculty Authors in Letters and Science is co-sponsored by the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum and the UC Davis Library.",

Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses.

    "description": "Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're still active**, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",
