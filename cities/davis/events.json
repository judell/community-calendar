(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

    "description": "This is the second session of a 2-part workshop. To attend, register for the workshop series and attend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions?

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

Enjoy browsing multiple art exhibits, complimentary wine by Matchbook Wines, and an art-themed scavenger hunt. Also, view special floral arrangements within the exhibits by the Davis Flower Arrangers. Free admission!\n\nManuel Fernando Rios: When They Reminisce Over You | Feb. 7 - Mar. 29\n\nThe artist’s work explores his Chicano heritage, as well as his family’s history and experiences. Blurring the line between naturalism and abstraction, he embraces the use of complex design patterns and photography to make a powerful statement. \n\nAssorted Flavors: Pence Member Exhibit | Mar. 13 - Apr. 16\n\nOur 2nd annual non-juried exhibit celebrates the creativity and talent of our organization’s supporters, showcasing work in different media by 40 Pence Members.\n\nBarbara Prodaniuk: Myths in Mud | Mar. 13 - Apr. 26\n\nThe ceramic artist’s work is inspired by the forest, meadows, and waterways surrounding the Truckee area. She explores the stories carried by the creatures and artifacts found in these environments through layered surfaces, organic textures, and sculpted imagery.\n\nLoraine Watson-Fox: Small Wonders | Mar. 6 - Mar. 29\n\nThe artist employs mixed-media including collage, text, thread and textural elements to enhance her use of more traditional paint media. Her work is on display along the stairway.\n\nDavis Flower Arrangers: Art in Bloom | Mar. 13 - Mar. 15\n\nIn a special collaboration, the Davis Flower Arrangers have put together creative floral arrangements to be paired with specific artworks on view at the Pence.\n\nScavenger Hunt: Join us for a fun, art-themed scavenger hunt at the Pence during the 2nd Friday ArtAbout. Complete all of the clues by exploring our exhibits for the chance to win a special prize.\n\n—\n\nVisit the Pence and other venues in Downtown Davis for the 2nd Friday ArtAbout artwalk. We will have printed ArtAbout guides available that week. Follow the ArtAbout’s Facebook page for more information: https://www.facebook.com/davisartabout.",

    "description": "Are you working on a research project but finding that your data is too big for your laptop, or that your code must run for a long time? You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provides an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nThe series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provide an overview of HPC terminology, architecture, and general workflows, and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transfer files, how to install software with miniconda, how to reserve computing time and run programs with SLURM, and execute shell commands that are especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice accessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facility’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learners must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day, with a break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series, learners should be able to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server;Transfer files to and from a server;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server;Use SLURM to run interactive and non-interactive software on a server;Explain etiquette for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Command Line” workshop, or have equivalent prior experience using command line. Specifically, you will need to know how to use command line to navigate your file system and inspect, create, edit and move files. Participants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Python, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e., able to navigate and create, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register for a HPC account during the session. CAS authentication is required.\n\n\nCan't make it to this training? Check out our workshop schedule. Materials from prior workshops are available on DataLab's website.\n \n\nQuestions?

    "description": "Are you working on a research project but finding that your data is too big for your laptop, or that your code must run for a long time? You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provides an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nThe series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provide an overview of HPC terminology, architecture, and general workflows, and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transfer files, how to install software with miniconda, how to reserve computing time and run programs with SLURM, and execute shell commands that are especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice accessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facility’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learners must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day, with a break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series, learners should be able to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server;Transfer files to and from a server;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server;Use SLURM to run interactive and non-interactive software on a server;Explain etiquette for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Command Line” workshop, or have equivalent prior experience using command line. Specifically, you will need to know how to use command line to navigate your file system and inspect, create, edit and move files. Participants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Python, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e., able to navigate and create, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register for a HPC account during the session. CAS authentication is required.\n\n\nCan't make it to this training? Check out our workshop schedule. Materials from prior workshops are available on DataLab's website.\n \n\nQuestions? Email datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses.

    "description": "Community Event\n\nThe Pence Joins Yolo Fest This Spring!\n\nThe Pence Gallery, a unique nonprofit art gallery highlighting local & regional artists, is participating in the county-wide Yolo Fest this spring. From March 27-29, 2026, Yolo Fest celebrates the region’s agriculture, music, arts, culture, farm-to-table food, craft beverages, recreation, and local hospitality. \n\nThe Pence Gallery in Davis will be open with three spectacular art exhibits from 11:30 AM - 5 PM, and admission is free to view these displays by these visual artists:\n\nManuel Fernando Rios: When They Reminisce Over You\n\nFebruary 7 - March 29\n\nIn his exhibit, Rios shares his interest in themes that explore his Chicano heritage, as well as his family’s history and experiences. Blurring the line between naturalism and abstraction, the artist embraces the use of complex design patterns, photography, and text to make a powerful statement. \n\nAssorted Flavors: Pence Member Exhibit\n\nMarch 13 - April 16\n\nView 40 works of art created by Pence Members in this widely ranging annual display of paintings, photographs, textiles, and more. \n\nBarbara Prodaniuk: Myths in Mud\n\nMarch 13 - April 26\n\nProdaniuk is a ceramic artist whose work is inspired by the forest, meadows, and waterways of the Truckee area. She explores stories carried by the animals and artifacts found in these environments. \n\nSpecial Weekend Activities\n\nSelf-guided Scavenger Hunt:\n\nMarch 28-29, 11:30 AM - 4:30 PM\n\nFree to participate!\n\nJoin us for a fun, art-themed scavenger hunt at the gallery by exploring the Pence’s exhibits. Complete all of the clues for the chance to be entered in a raffle to win a $25 gift certificate to the Pence gift store! A raffle winner will be selected and contacted at 4:30 PM on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nPrintmaking for All Ages\n\nSunday, March 29, 1-3 PM\n\n$5 Members | $10 Non-Members (per person, all materials included)\n\nIn this workshop, printmaking is made easy!

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

Materson, associate professor of history, traces civil rights activist Ruth Reynolds’ deep involvement in the movement for Puerto Rico’s independence in Radical Solidarity, offering a nuanced account of political allyship, anti-colonial struggle and cross-racial collaboration. \n Corrie Decker, associate professor of history, examines how colonial courts and ethnographers in 20th century East Africa transformed complex rites of passage into simplified “puberty rites\" in The Age of Sex: Custom, Law, and Ritual in Twentieth-Century East Africa, reshaping legal understandings of childhood, adulthood, gender and sexual maturity. \n \n\nCovered: Spotlighting Faculty Authors in Letters and Science is co-sponsored by the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum and the UC Davis Library.",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",

We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.",
