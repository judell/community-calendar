    "description": "The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) represents a landmark moment in the presentation of ancient Egyptian civilization to the world. Beyond its monumental scale, the museum invites renewed reflection on how ancient Egyptians understood beauty, harmony, and meaning in art.\n\n\n\nThis public lecture explores the aesthetic principles that shaped ancient Egyptian art, including balance, proportion, symbolism, material selection, and visual order. Rather than viewing ancient artworks as isolated objects, the talk explains how they were part of a broader cultural and religious system in which beauty was closely connected to ideas of permanence, divine order, and cosmic harmony. \n\nUsing selected examples of sculpture, reliefs, and architectural elements, the lecture discusses how these aesthetic values are now reinterpreted through modern museum display practices at the Grand Egyptian Museum. By connecting ancient artistic intentions with contemporary exhibition approaches, the lecture highlights how ancient Egyptian art continues to communicate meaning and cultural identity today. The talk will be given by Ahmad Hussein, PhD.\n\nSource: Yolo Library",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event?

Michele earned her PhD from UC Davis in Geography where she studied California’s sandy beach ecosystem with traditional phytosociological methods and innovative remote sensing tools and was a postdoc at the UC Davis Information Center for the Environment. In her current position as a geospatial data scientist at UC Davis DataLab, she applies geospatial tools to new avenues of research across disciplines.\n \n\nPrerequisites: For the best experience, we recommend learners have the following skills before taking this workshop: an introductory understanding of programming in R (for example, you are familiar with how to load libraries, load common data formats like a CSV, and are comfortable running basic commands). See DataLab’s R Basics Workshop for help; an introductory understanding of spatial data (for example, you are familiar with the difference between raster and vector data). See DataLab’s ,a href=\"https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_spatial_data_formats/\">Spatial Data Formats Workshop for help; (recommended) review the concepts (first section) of DataLab’s Cartography for Academic Publications Workshop.\n \n\nSoftware Required: To fully participate in this workshop, learners should download and install R and RStudio on their laptop before the workshop begins.\n \n\nPlease RSVP.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

It will help students at UC Davis gain a deeper understanding of the Hmong heritage. It will provide Hmong students a space where they can see their culture represented, affirmed and celebrated, thereby fostering a sense of belonging and cultural pride. By inviting not only Hmong students but also non-Hmong peers, we create a shared experience of learning and appreciation. The Hmong cultural practices, whether music, dance, fashion, or food all carry stories of migration, resilience, and identity.\n\nSource: UC Davis CampusGroups",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

    "description": "This is the second session of a 2-part workshop. To attend, register for the workshop series and attend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R, we will move past coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems with structure and data types, and write scripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of \"tidy data,\" ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text processing, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand, scraping the web, or importing text files, this training will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data from text;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text; Use the “lubridate” package to parse dates and times;Identify features of a \"tidy\" dataset;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data;Use the \"tidyr\" package to reshape data;Describe what a join is;Compare differences between an inner join and left join;Use the \"dplyr\" package to join two data sets on a common column;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our \"R Basics\" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions?

    "description": "Join us for the 4th annual We Rise Retreat (formerly known as the Women of Color Retreat) taking place at Walker Creek Ranch on February 27th-March 1st, 2026!\n\nThe We Rise Retreat is hosted by the UC Davis Women's Resource & Research Center to foster opportunities for identity and skill development as well as community building for UC Davis students (must be currently registered at any level). Our theme for We Rise is Reimagining Healing, Reimagining Self: Unmasking What's Within!\n\nThis retreat creates an intentional space grounded in the lived experiences, wisdom, and leadership of women of color.

This is a drop-in program for ages 5-12. No registration in advance is required, but space and supplies are limited to the first 25 participants and are available on a first come, first served basis.\n\nWhen you arrive, pay with cash or card at the front desk.

Stay as long or as short as you like over the two hour period.\n\nBecome a Member starting at $70/year and save! If you join the Pence Gallery when you attend this workshop, you can enjoy Member pricing for Art in Action, plus receive a $5 gift certificate to our gift shop as a thank you!

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

    "description": "Are you working on a research project but finding that your data is too big for your laptop, or that your code must run for a long time? You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provides an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nThe series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provide an overview of HPC terminology, architecture, and general workflows, and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transfer files, how to install software with miniconda, how to reserve computing time and run programs with SLURM, and execute shell commands that are especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice accessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facility’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learners must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day, with a break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series, learners should be able to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server;Transfer files to and from a server;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server;Use SLURM to run interactive and non-interactive software on a server;Explain etiquette for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Command Line” workshop, or have equivalent prior experience using command line. Specifically, you will need to know how to use command line to navigate your file system and inspect, create, edit and move files. Participants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Python, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e., able to navigate and create, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register for a HPC account during the session. CAS authentication is required.\n\n\nCan't make it to this training? Check out our workshop schedule. Materials from prior workshops are available on DataLab's website.\n \n\nQuestions? Email datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

As we learn we’ll practice accessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facility’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learners must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day, with a break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series, learners should be able to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server;Transfer files to and from a server;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server;Use SLURM to run interactive and non-interactive software on a server;Explain etiquette for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Command Line” workshop, or have equivalent prior experience using command line. Specifically, you will need to know how to use command line to navigate your file system and inspect, create, edit and move files. Participants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Python, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e., able to navigate and create, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register for a HPC account during the session. CAS authentication is required.\n\n\nCan't make it to this training? Check out our workshop schedule. Materials from prior workshops are available on DataLab's website.\n \n\nQuestions? Email datalab-training@ucdavis.edu.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library",

    "description": "Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're still active**, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

She explores stories carried by the animals and artifacts found in these environments. \n\nSpecial Weekend Activities\n\nSelf-guided Scavenger Hunt:\n\nMarch 28-29, 11:30 AM - 4:30 PM\n\nFree to participate!\n\nJoin us for a fun, art-themed scavenger hunt at the gallery by exploring the Pence’s exhibits.

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

Materson and Corrie Decker as part of Covered, a monthly event series celebrating recent books from the College of Letters and Science.\n \n\nLisa G. Materson, associate professor of history, traces civil rights activist Ruth Reynolds’ deep involvement in the movement for Puerto Rico’s independence in Radical Solidarity, offering a nuanced account of political allyship, anti-colonial struggle and cross-racial collaboration. \n Corrie Decker, associate professor of history, examines how colonial courts and ethnographers in 20th century East Africa transformed complex rites of passage into simplified “puberty rites\" in The Age of Sex: Custom, Law, and Ritual in Twentieth-Century East Africa, reshaping legal understandings of childhood, adulthood, gender and sexual maturity. \n \n\nCovered: Spotlighting Faculty Authors in Letters and Science is co-sponsored by the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum and the UC Davis Library.\n\nSource: UC Davis Library\n\nSource: Ucdavis Library",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",

(See group description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for board games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables reserved near the back; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usually start arriving around 5pm, and games start whenever people are ready. Blue Note closes at 9pm, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace period there, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9, or else pack it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blue Note is a brewery, not a bar, so there's no restriction against minors. In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection, water and sodas are available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us, but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef team makes a mean pizza, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering",
