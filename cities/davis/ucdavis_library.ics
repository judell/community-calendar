 s are anything but single-origin. A complex blend of bean growing\, market
  distribution\, roasting science\, brewing technique and changing consumer
  tastes is transforming coffee culture in the United States. From supply c
 hain challenges and higher prices to the shift toward customizable\, conve
 nient drinks\, the specialty coffee ecosystem is venturing into new territ
 ory. Our panelists’ expertise will lead you to rethink: How should you t
 ake your coffee?\n\n \n\nThe event will feature a panel of leading industr
 y experts including:\n\nJerry Baldwin\, co-founder of Starbucks and former
  president of Peet's CoffeeRuss Kramer\, president of Hacienda La MinitaEl
 iana Cossio\, vice president of Global R&D at Westrock Coffee CompanyPeter
  Giuliano\, chief research officer of the Specialty Coffee Association and
  executive director of the Coffee Science FoundationModerator Bill Ristenp
 art\, director of the UC Davis Coffee Center \n\nA pop-up exhibit from the
  library's Archives and Special Collections will be on display.\n\n \n\nTh
 e event includes a welcome reception\, a hosted bar with wine and non-alco
 holic drinks\, and appetizers. Tickets are $25/person ($15/students).\n\n

DESCRIPTION:This intermediate R workshop is all about making it easier to 
 run\, reuse\, and share R code by improving your scripts!\n\n \n\nWe'll co
 ver what scripts are\, how to organize code in a script\, how to make scri
 pts executable\, how to handle inputs and outputs\, and how to reuse funct
 ions from one script in another. In order to make sure you and others you 
 share your scripts with can run them\, we'll also cover how to manage inst
 alled packages and their versions with R's built-in functions and the "ren
 v" package. The workshop will end with a brief discussion of what to do ne
 xt if you want to turn your scripts into fully-fledged R packages.\n\n \n\
 nAfter completing this workshop\, learners should be able to:\n\n– Creat
 e executable R scripts\;\n– Organize scripts according to best practices
 \;\n– Modify scripts to accept input via command line arguments\;\n– M
 odify code to log output to the console or a file\;\n– Create loops to r
 un repetitive or iterative code\;\n– Use R's built-in functions to maint
 ain installed packages\;\n– Use the "renv" package to control package ve
 rsions\;\n\n \n\nThis workshop is offered in person only. Advance registra
 tion requested.\n\n \n\n \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended fo
 r motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their e
 xisting R skills. Thus\, we won't cover introductory R questions during th
 is session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax\, and h
 ave the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their
  laptops. If you're new to R\, or want to brush up\, we suggest you start 
 with our "R Basics" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event
 ? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab
 's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\

DESCRIPTION:Choosing a repository is an important task that can impact the
  discoverability and long-term maintenance of your research data. There ar
 e several interactive tools designed to help with the selection process. T
 hese include filterable repository “finders\," which allow researchers t
 o identify and compare relevant repositories. In this session\, learners w
 ill learn when to use repository finders\, receive demonstrations of two r
 epository finders\, and participate in evaluating repositories based on th
 eir characteristics. Learners will receive a summary handout after attendi
 ng this session. \n\n \n\nThis workshop is offered as part of UC Love Data
  Week. Advance registration required.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datalab-t

DESCRIPTION:Join us for this case study from a Research Librarian Beth Twe
 edy at UC Davis\, who used 'low-stakes' data to learn high-stakes research
  tools!\n\nLearning new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can
  feel risky when you are working with critical research data. It started w
 hen I was daydreaming at work about my Dungeons & Dragons campaign and rea
 lized the best way to learn these tools (for me) was to take the "work" ou
 t of the equation. Join me for a case study on how I used a personal D&D d
 atabase as a "sandbox" to learn high-impact data skills. By working with d
 ata I knew intimately (and didn't mind breaking)\, I was able to experimen
 t with AI tools\, fail safely\, and eventually build a working automated p
 ipeline. This isn't a talk about being a coding genius\; it's about how a 
 librarian harnessed curiosity and personal passion to gain a better unders
 tanding of how these often intimidating black-box tools actually work.\n\n
  \n\nThis session is designed for:\n\nResearchers\, Scholars\, and Practit
 ioners interested in "Ground Truth" testing — using known data to safely
  audit the strengths\, weaknesses\, and limits of AI tools before trusting
  them with your scholarship.Librarians who want a practical look at how a 
 researcher might approach the steep learning curve of this landscape. This
  session offers a viable path for building the technical vocabulary to tra
 nslate user needs to technical experts/developers as well as applying thes
 e skills to your own work.Technical Experts & Data Scientists who support 
 research. By watching a "research hacker" navigate the messy reality of AI
  integration\, you will see how users who "know enough to be dangerous" ac
 tually approach these problems\, offering insights on how to better antici
 pate pitfalls and guide the campus community. \n\nThis workshop is offered
  as part of UC Love Data Week. Advance registration required.\n\n \n\nQues

DESCRIPTION:If a picture tells a thousand words then a data visualization 
 can convey a million! Join us to learn how to apply data visualization pri
 nciples and best practices to generate compelling plots with ggplot in R. 
 Through a series of case studies\, we'll make static plots and practice it
 erating to improve upon them and the data stories they tell.\n\nThis works
 hop is for current R users who want to expand their plotting skills\, and 
 thus is not an introduction to the R programming langauge. It is part of D
 ataLab's "Intermediate R" training series\, which you can learn more about
  on our training website.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this workshop\, learner
 s should be able to:\n\n* write code to generate plots in R using the ggpl
 ot2 package\n\n* develop various different plot types (dot plots\, histogr
 ams\, bar charts\, boxplots\, time series\, etc.)\n\n* employ ggplot's gra
 mmar of graphics syntax to customize plots\,\n\n* effectively use layers a
 nd aesthetics to make plots more informative and meaningful (including add
 ing groupings\, scaling\, color\, faceting\, labels\, and trendlines)\n\n 
 \n\nThis workshop is offered in person and as a virtual broadcast as part 
 of UC Love Data Week. Local learners are encouraged to attend in person. A
 ll members of the University of California system are welcome to register.
  Advance registration required.\n\n \n\n \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis worksho
 p is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis and the 
 other UCs who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus\, we won't cover 
 introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfo
 rtable with basic R syntax\, and have the latest version of R and RStudio 
 pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R\, or want t
 o brush up\, we suggest you start with our "R Basics" workshop curriculum.
 \n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab 
 workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our workshop sched

DESCRIPTION:Are you working on a research project but finding that your da
 ta is too big for your laptop\, or that your code must run for a long time
 ? You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provide
 s an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC 
 Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nT
 he series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provi
 de an overview of HPC terminology\, architecture\, and general workflows\,
  and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transf
 er files\, how to install software with miniconda\, how to reserve computi
 ng time and run programs with SLURM\, and execute shell commands that are 
 especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice a
 ccessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facil
 ity’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learner
 s must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day\, with a 
 break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series\, learners should be abl
 e to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server\;Transfer files to and from a serve
 r\;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server\;Use SLURM t
 o run interactive and non-interactive software on a server\;Explain etique
 tte for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to 
 cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\
 nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Co
 mmand Line” workshop\, or have equivalent prior experience using command
  line. Specifically\, you will need to know how to use command line to nav
 igate your file system and inspect\, create\, edit and move files. Partici
 pants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Pyth
 on\, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e.\, able to navigate and create
 \, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register f
 or a HPC account during the session. CAS authentication is required.\n\n\n
 Can't make it to this training? Check out our workshop schedule. Materials

SUMMARY:Introduction to Remote Computing and HPC (2-day workshop)
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20260318
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20260318
UID:tag:localist.com\,2008:EventInstance_51809290268974
DESCRIPTION:Are you working on a research project but finding that your da
 ta is too big for your laptop\, or that your code must run for a long time
 ? You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provide
 s an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC 
 Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nT
 he series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provi
 de an overview of HPC terminology\, architecture\, and general workflows\,
  and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transf
 er files\, how to install software with miniconda\, how to reserve computi
 ng time and run programs with SLURM\, and execute shell commands that are 
 especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice a
 ccessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facil
 ity’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learner
 s must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day\, with a 
 break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series\, learners should be abl
 e to:\n\nUse SSH to log in to a server\;Transfer files to and from a serve
 r\;Set up and use conda/mamba to install software on a server\;Use SLURM t
 o run interactive and non-interactive software on a server\;Explain etique
 tte for using a server cluster such as Hive.\nThis workshop is subject to 
 cancellation if minimum enrollment is not achieved.\n \n\nPREREQUISITES\n\
 nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Co
 mmand Line” workshop\, or have equivalent prior experience using command
  line. Specifically\, you will need to know how to use command line to nav
 igate your file system and inspect\, create\, edit and move files. Partici
 pants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Pyth
 on\, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e.\, able to navigate and create
 \, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register f
 or a HPC account during the session. CAS authentication is required.\n\n\n
 Can't make it to this training? Check out our workshop schedule. Materials
  from prior workshops are available on DataLab's website.\n \n\nQuestions?
