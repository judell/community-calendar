SUMMARY:A Guided Nature Walk (Free event)
DESCRIPTION:Iama Embodied Community\nJoin Michael for a guided exploration
  into the practice of slowing down and deepening our relationship with the
  natural world. This immersive walk invites participants to engage with th
 e subtle intelligence of the landscape\, from Blue Oaks and seasonal wildf
 lowers to the presence of scrub jays overhead. Together\, we will explore 
 how to “read” trees\, interpret the wind\, and sit in quiet reflection
  with grandmother trees. Along the way\, we will open conversation about h
 ow nature teaches\, communicates\, and invites us into deeper awareness.\n
 \n**Location:** Sterling Pointe Ct\, Loomis\, CA 95650\n**Distance:** 3.2 
 miles\n**Elevation Gain:** 375 feet\n**Level:** Easy to Moderate\n**Pace:*
 * Slow\, with frequent stops for observation and discussion\n**Meet at tra
 ilhead:** 9:30 AM\n**Hike Begins:** 9:45 AM\n**End Time:** 1:15 PM\n\nPlea
 se bring lunch\, water\, and appropriate footwear.\nThis experience is des
 igned not as a workout\, but as a practice in presence.\n\n### About the g
 uide\n\nMichael is a lifelong hiker\, backpacker\, and outdoor enthusiast.
  He is WFR-trained and adult CPR-certified. Michael’s connection to the 
 land has been shaped by journeys through places like Death Valley and the 
 Grand Canyon\, though his true roots run deep in Mount Diablo. Guided by c
 uriosity and a love of self-studying trees and plants\, he has learned the
  languages of wind\, water\, and earth—finding meaning in slowing down a
 nd walking with presence.\n\n**P.S.** If you wish to carpool from Sacramen
 to\, meet at Parkview Presbyterian Church’s parking lot on 727 T st at 8
 :30 AM. We will be leaving at 8:45 sharp.
