DESCRIPTION:Community Event\n\nJoin us at the Pence Gallery for our 2nd Fr
 iday ArtAbout reception on February 13\, 6-9 PM. Enjoy browsing multiple a
 rt exhibits\, shopping in our Seconds Sale\, complimentary wine\, and an a
 rt-themed scavenger hunt. Free admission!\n\nManuel Fernando Rios: When Th
 ey Reminisce Over You | Feb. 7 - Mar. 29\n\nIn his exhibit\, Manuel Fernan
 do Rios shares his interest in themes that explore his Chicano heritage\, 
 as well as his family’s history and experiences. Blurring the line betwe
 en naturalism and abstraction\, the artist embraces the use of complex des
 ign patterns and photography to make a powerful statement. \n\nCharlene W
 ill: Here for a While | Jan. 9 - Feb. 28\n\nView a solo exhibit by Charlen
 e Will\, the recipient of the 2025 Pence Gallery Emerging Artist Award. He
 r work is rooted in a reverence for nature. Working with oils on canvas\, 
 she uses traditional and self-taught brushwork\, glazes\, and the removal 
 of layers to reveal the ephemeral qualities of light and color found in va
 rious natural ecosystems.\n\nSeconds Sale | Feb. 13 - Mar. 6 \n\nArtists 
 often decide to part with works that are experimental\, have a small flaw\
 , are older pieces\, or duplicates\, so that they can clear space and star
 t new projects\, sharing those works with the people in a ‘seconds sale.
 ’ Find unique works of art from 25+ professional artists\, such as ceram
 ics\, paintings\, textile art\, and more in the sale upstairs.\n\nMaris Ka
 plan: Amateur | Jan. 9 - Feb. 18\n\nWith a focus on sustainability\, Maris
  Kaplan’s work often incorporates secondhand materials such as thrifted 
 fabric\, upcycled clothing\, and found objects. On display along the stair
 way\, this series showcases experimentation with new techniques and materi
 als\, embracing wobbly lines\, crooked stitches\, unexpected shapes\, and 
 random color combinations.\n\nScavenger Hunt: Join us for a fun\, art-them
 ed scavenger hunt at the Pence during the 2nd Friday ArtAbout. Complete al
 l of the clues by exploring our exhibits for the chance to win a special p
 rize.\n\n—\n\nVisit the Pence and other venues in Downtown Davis for the
  2nd Friday ArtAbout artwalk. We will have printed ArtAbout guides availab
 le that week. Follow the ArtAbout’s Facebook page for more information:
