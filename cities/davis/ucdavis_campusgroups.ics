UID:389dec36bbe3d1b5818eab42ca84498e7112025_2:25:43_PM@campusgroups.com
DESCRIPTION:KHLF funds public interest work by UC Davis School of Law stud
 ents for such causes as environmental protection\, LGBT+ and women’s rig
 hts\, racial justice\, and housing security. While public interest groups 
 have a critical need for student interns\, they often lack the resources t
 o provide even modest stipends. In turn\, law students interested in pursu
 ing social justice careers may not have the financial flexibility to accep
 t unpaid positions with these organizations. Our upcoming 47th Annual Char
 ity Auction will serve as our primary funding source for student grants th
 is year. \n\nKHLF fills this gap. We seek to provide summer grants to all 
 students at UC Davis School of Law who wish to work for public interest ca
 uses such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)\, Legal Services of
  Northern California\, the East Bay Community Law Center\, California Indi
 an Legal Services\, and Disability Rights California.

 Executive\, Former Navy Blue Angels Flight Leader\, Leadership Speaker\, A
 uthor\, Sponsored by Intellisoft\n\nHigh-Trust Leadership and Teamwork\nIn
  the knowledge-based economy\, high performance is all about relationships
 \, strong and enduring relationships with all stakeholders\, and the funda
 mental ingredient for every successful relationship is trust.\n\nFor naval
  aviators\, flying off aircraft carriers a thousand miles from land (often
  in the middle of the night) trust is essential not just for success\, but
  survival. There can be no compromise in that extreme laboratory of high p
 erformance. If you weren’t trusted\, you’d fail or be fired\; if you c
 an’t trust others\, you’ll either fail or look for another line of wor
 k.\n\nTrust is the cornerstone to being an effective leader\; it’s the g
 lue that keeps the team firing on all cylinders. Within a culture of trust
 \, there is an upward spiral of achievement based on creativity\, determin
 ation\, accountability\, excellence\, passion\, camaraderie\, humor\, cand
 or\, and resilience. Allowing a culture of mistrust due to fear\, incompet
 ence\, and/or integrity gaps will result in the opposite.\n\nTake-aways:\n
 Understand why a culture of HIGH-TRUST is critical to achieving individual
  and organizational high performance\nDiscover the 5C’s of trustworthine
 ss: Character\, Commitment\, Competence\, Connection\, and Communication\n
 Develop a high-trust action plan with specific\, immediate actions (90-min
