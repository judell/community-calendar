DESCRIPTION:Community Event\n\nJoin us at the Pence Gallery for our 2nd Fr
 iday ArtAbout reception on February 13\, 6-9 PM. Enjoy browsing multiple a
 rt exhibits\, shopping in our Seconds Sale\, complimentary wine\, and an a
 rt-themed scavenger hunt. Free admission!\n\nManuel Fernando Rios: When Th
 ey Reminisce Over You | Feb. 7 - Mar. 29\n\nIn his exhibit\, Manuel Fernan
 do Rios shares his interest in themes that explore his Chicano heritage\, 
 as well as his family’s history and experiences. Blurring the line betwe
 en naturalism and abstraction\, the artist embraces the use of complex des
 ign patterns and photography to make a powerful statement. \n\nCharlene W
 ill: Here for a While | Jan. 9 - Feb. 28\n\nView a solo exhibit by Charlen
 e Will\, the recipient of the 2025 Pence Gallery Emerging Artist Award. He
 r work is rooted in a reverence for nature. Working with oils on canvas\, 
 she uses traditional and self-taught brushwork\, glazes\, and the removal 
 of layers to reveal the ephemeral qualities of light and color found in va
 rious natural ecosystems.\n\nSeconds Sale | Feb. 13 - Mar. 6 \n\nArtists 
 often decide to part with works that are experimental\, have a small flaw\
 , are older pieces\, or duplicates\, so that they can clear space and star
 t new projects\, sharing those works with the people in a ‘seconds sale.
 ’ Find unique works of art from 25+ professional artists\, such as ceram
 ics\, paintings\, textile art\, and more in the sale upstairs.\n\nMaris Ka
 plan: Amateur | Jan. 9 - Feb. 18\n\nWith a focus on sustainability\, Maris
  Kaplan’s work often incorporates secondhand materials such as thrifted 
 fabric\, upcycled clothing\, and found objects. On display along the stair
 way\, this series showcases experimentation with new techniques and materi
 als\, embracing wobbly lines\, crooked stitches\, unexpected shapes\, and 
 random color combinations.\n\nScavenger Hunt: Join us for a fun\, art-them
 ed scavenger hunt at the Pence during the 2nd Friday ArtAbout. Complete al
 l of the clues by exploring our exhibits for the chance to win a special p
 rize.\n\n—\n\nVisit the Pence and other venues in Downtown Davis for the
  2nd Friday ArtAbout artwalk. We will have printed ArtAbout guides availab
 le that week. Follow the ArtAbout’s Facebook page for more information:

DESCRIPTION:The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) represents
  a landmark moment in the presentation of ancient Egyptian civilization to
  the world. Beyond its monumental scale\, the museum invites renewed refle
 ction on how ancient Egyptians understood beauty\, harmony\, and meaning i
 n art.\n\n\n\nThis public lecture explores the aesthetic principles that s
 haped ancient Egyptian art\, including balance\, proportion\, symbolism\, 
 material selection\, and visual order. Rather than viewing ancient artwork
 s as isolated objects\, the talk explains how they were part of a broader 
 cultural and religious system in which beauty was closely connected to ide
 as of permanence\, divine order\, and cosmic harmony. \n\nUsing selected 
 examples of sculpture\, reliefs\, and architectural elements\, the lecture
  discusses how these aesthetic values are now reinterpreted through modern
  museum display practices at the Grand Egyptian Museum. By connecting anci
 ent artistic intentions with contemporary exhibition approaches\, the lect
 ure highlights how ancient Egyptian art continues to communicate meaning a
 nd cultural identity today. The talk will be given by Ahmad Hussein\, PhD

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night at Blue Note
DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering

DESCRIPTION:Cleaning your data is often the most time-consuming part of re
 search. In this 2-part workshop for researchers using R\, we will move pas
 t coding basics to tackle the complexities of real datasets and learn effe
 ctive data preparation workflows.\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficientl
 y identify potential problems with structure and data types\, and write sc
 ripts to effectively convert and correct these issues. We'll discuss the p
 rinciples of "tidy data\," ensuring your datasets are structured perfectly
  for your analysis and visualization. Then we’ll take a deep dive into t
 he stringr package for text processing\, and the lubridate package for han
 dling dates and times. You’ll also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to r
 eshape data and join linked datasets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering you
 r data by hand\, scraping the web\, or importing text files\, this trainin
 g will help expand your R coding skills to turn your data into analysis-re
 ady files with confidence and reproducibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing th
 is training\, learners should be able to:\n\nInspect data files to determi
 ne how best to load them into R\;  Identify and convert features to approp
 riate data types\;Use the “stringr” package clean and extract data fro
 m text\;Use regular expressions to describe patterns in text\; Use the “
 lubridate” package to parse dates and times\;Identify features of a "tid
 y" dataset\;Describe the advantages and disadvantages of tidy data\;Use th
 e "tidyr" package to reshape data\;Describe what a join is\;Compare differ
 ences between an inner join and left join\;Use the "dplyr" package to join
  two data sets on a common column\;and learn where to go to learn more! \n
 \nThis workshop is offered in person only. All members of UC Davis are wel
 come to register. Advance registration required. Please plan to attend bot
 h sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 19\, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 2
 6\, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis workshop is intended fo
 r motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis who want to hone their e
 xisting R skills. Thus\, we won't cover introductory R questions during th
 is session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax\, and h
 ave the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their
  laptops. If you're new to R\, or want to brush up\, we suggest you start 
 with our "R Basics" workshop curriculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event
 ? Materials from prior UC Davis DataLab workshops are available on DataLab
 's website. Check out our workshop schedule for other upcoming trainings.\

DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering

DESCRIPTION:This is the second session of a 2-part workshop. To attend\, r
 egister for the workshop series and attend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data i
 s often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop 
 for researchers using R\, we will move past coding basics to tackle the co
 mplexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows
 .\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems wi
 th structure and data types\, and write scripts to effectively convert and
  correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of "tidy data\," ensur
 ing your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualiza
 tion. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text proc
 essing\, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll 
 also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked data
 sets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand\, scraping the we
 b\, or importing text files\, this training will help expand your R coding
  skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and re
 producibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training\, learners should be
  able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R\
 ;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types\;Use the “str
 ingr” package clean and extract data from text\;Use regular expressions 
 to describe patterns in text\; Use the “lubridate” package to parse da
 tes and times\;Identify features of a "tidy" dataset\;Describe the advanta
 ges and disadvantages of tidy data\;Use the "tidyr" package to reshape dat
 a\;Describe what a join is\;Compare differences between an inner join and 
 left join\;Use the "dplyr" package to join two data sets on a common colum
 n\;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in pe
 rson only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance regist
 ration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 
 19\, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26\, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPre
 requisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all do
 mains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus\, we won'
 t cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should 
 be comfortable with basic R syntax\, and have the latest version of R and 
 RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R\, o
 r want to brush up\, we suggest you start with our "R Basics" workshop cur
 riculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis 
 DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our worksh
 op schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datal

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night at Blue Note
DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering

 ? You need more compute power!\n \n\nThis 2-day intensive workshop provide
 s an introduction to accessing and computing on remote servers such as UC 
 Davis’ HPC (high performance cluster) to elevate your research. \n \n\nT
 he series covers everything you need to know to get started. We’ll provi
 de an overview of HPC terminology\, architecture\, and general workflows\,
  and guide learners through how to set up and use SSH to log in and transf
 er files\, how to install software with miniconda\, how to reserve computi
 ng time and run programs with SLURM\, and execute shell commands that are 
 especially useful for working with servers. As we learn we’ll practice a
 ccessing and computing on remote servers using the UC Davis HPC Core Facil
 ity’s new “Hive” cluster.\n \n\nThe material builds and thus learner
 s must attend both days. Sessions run from 10 AM - 4 PM each day\, with a 
 break for lunch.\n \n\nAfter this workshop series\, learners should be abl

 nParticipants should have taken DataLab’s “Introduction to the Unix Co
 mmand Line” workshop\, or have equivalent prior experience using command
  line. Specifically\, you will need to know how to use command line to nav
 igate your file system and inspect\, create\, edit and move files. Partici
 pants must be comfortable with programming in a language such as R or Pyth
 on\, and with basic Linux shell syntax (i.e.\, able to navigate and create
 \, modify and move files via command line).\n \n\nLearners will register f

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night at Blue Note
DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering

 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering

 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu

 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night at Blue Note
DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.\n\nSource: Meetup: Yolo Board Game Gathering
