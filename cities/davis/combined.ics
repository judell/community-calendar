DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti

 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.

DESCRIPTION:This is the second session of a 2-part workshop. To attend\, r
 egister for the workshop series and attend part 1.\n\nCleaning your data i
 s often the most time-consuming part of research. In this 2-part workshop 
 for researchers using R\, we will move past coding basics to tackle the co
 mplexities of real datasets and learn effective data preparation workflows
 .\n\n \n\nWe'll practice how to efficiently identify potential problems wi
 th structure and data types\, and write scripts to effectively convert and
  correct these issues. We'll discuss the principles of "tidy data\," ensur
 ing your datasets are structured perfectly for your analysis and visualiza
 tion. Then we’ll take a deep dive into the stringr package for text proc
 essing\, and the lubridate package for handling dates and times. You’ll 
 also learn how to use tidyr and dplyr to reshape data and join linked data
 sets.\n\n \n\nWhether you're gathering your data by hand\, scraping the we
 b\, or importing text files\, this training will help expand your R coding
  skills to turn your data into analysis-ready files with confidence and re
 producibility.\n\n \n\nAfter completing this training\, learners should be
  able to:\n\nInspect data files to determine how best to load them into R\
 ;  Identify and convert features to appropriate data types\;Use the “str
 ingr” package clean and extract data from text\;Use regular expressions 
 to describe patterns in text\; Use the “lubridate” package to parse da
 tes and times\;Identify features of a "tidy" dataset\;Describe the advanta
 ges and disadvantages of tidy data\;Use the "tidyr" package to reshape dat
 a\;Describe what a join is\;Compare differences between an inner join and 
 left join\;Use the "dplyr" package to join two data sets on a common colum
 n\;and learn where to go to learn more! \n\nThis workshop is offered in pe
 rson only. All members of UC Davis are welcome to register. Advance regist
 ration required. Please plan to attend both sessions:\n\nPart 1: February 
 19\, 2026 (10 AM- 12 PM)Part 2: February 26\, 2026 (10 AM - 12 PM) \n\nPre
 requisites\n\nThis workshop is intended for motivated learners from all do
 mains at UC Davis who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus\, we won'
 t cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should 
 be comfortable with basic R syntax\, and have the latest version of R and 
 RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R\, o
 r want to brush up\, we suggest you start with our "R Basics" workshop cur
 riculum.\n\n \n\nCan’t attend this event? Materials from prior UC Davis 
 DataLab workshops are available on DataLab's website. Check out our worksh
 op schedule for other upcoming trainings.\n\n \n\nQuestions? Contact datal

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night at Blue Note
DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.

 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night at Blue Note
DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti
 ll active**\, but we primarily use Discord to chat and plan events. (See g
 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.

DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti

 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.

 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu

 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea

DESCRIPTION:Yolo County Board Game Gathering\nUpdate 8/14/25:\n**We're sti

 roup description for invite link.)\n\nWe still meet every Wednesday for bo
 ard games at Blue Note Brewing Company. We'll have a handful of tables res
 erved near the back\; just look for the pile of board games.\n\nPeople usu
 ally start arriving around 5pm\, and games start whenever people are ready
 . Blue Note closes at 9pm\, and although we have a 5-10 minute grace perio
 d there\, you should be in the process of final scoring by 9\, or else pac
 k it up and play again another day.\n\nGame night is open to all ages! Blu
 e Note is a brewery\, not a bar\, so there's no restriction against minors
 . In addition to their crafted-in-house beer selection\, water and sodas a
 re available.\n\nYou're not required to buy anything in order to join us\,
  but we do encourage you to support local businesses. Blue Note's chef tea
 m makes a mean pizza\, and there are other nearby downtown restaurants and
  businesses.
