SUMMARY:Threads Between Us
DESCRIPTION:March 6th from 5:30p to 8:00p\nJoin us for Threads Between Us\, a hands-on community weaving experience in partnership with Art Remains ReUse Center. Together\, we’ll complete the Community Lotus\, the project was created by artist Sue McCrackin. Together we will weave with t-shirt yarn made from Lotus Festival shirts of years past. \nThis is more than an art project. It’s a living tapestry of threads from festivals\, memories\, music\, and moments\, all woven into something new. Each strand carries a story. Each hand adds strength. \nDrop in\, take a turn at the loom\, and become part of the design. No weaving experience needed\, just a willingness to connect\, create\, and continue the story. \nLet’s finish the lotus together!
