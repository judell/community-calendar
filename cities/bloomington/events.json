    "description": "Join us for Coffee with Friends on Sunday, February 22 from 2 to 3 pm in Meeting Room 1B at the Downtown Library. The Friends of the Library welcomes author Claire Arbogast who will discuss her most recent book, \"If Not the Whole Truth\" in which a young woman struggles to ferret out her place in the counterculture of the late 1960s era only to find in 2022 America that everything she holds dear, even her own life, is in jeopardy.\n\n“Historically rich, with …. searing contemporary relevance.”—Kirkus Reviews\n\nThe daughter of florists and granddaughter of a prolific gardener, Claire Arbogast was born in 1950. She grew up among the winding streets and deep front porches of historic Irvington on the eastside of Indianapolis. But her life took a wide turn as books and the times challenged her limited perspective of the world. This questioning wove its way into her very fiber, leading her to try on different ways to live, different ways to love, and different ways to write with the hope of opening up conversations and attitudes.\n\nAfter a few years of exploring (southern Indiana, Chicago, California, The Farm in Tennessee, Albuquerque, touring the country in a handmade camper, Fort Worth, and a couple winters in Alaska), she earned a degree in journalism from Indiana University-Bloomington and went on to work in communications, living in Fort Wayne, Bloomington, and Cincinnati.\n\nThese days, she gardens and writes in Bloomington, Indiana, relishing every sweet day with a thirst for sorting, rejecting, and adapting to the infinite stream of ideas that flow into our lives.\n\nLearn more about Arbogast and her work at www.clairearbogast.com http://www.clairearbogast.com .\n\nRefreshments provided by the Friends Hospitality Committee.

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the China National Space Agency (CNSA) are likely to succeed in landing crewed spacecraft on Mars within the next 2 decades. NASA, ESA, and CNSA participate in the Committee on Space Research which develops and publishes international standards related to space exploration including future human exploration on Mars near surface locations with evidence of temperatures reaching above -25 0C (-13 0F) and having water available for biological reactions. These two conditions define Special Regions which are expected to be priority targets in the search for evidence of extraterrestrial life. The environmental challenge lies in collecting samples from Special Regions without the transfer of terrestrial microorganisms capable of survival and growth. Lisa Pratt, Professor Emerita of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, former NASA Planetary Protection Officer, and Co-Chair of the Committee on Planetary Protection for the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, will help us consider whether the international race to explore with humans will override the scientific imperative to prevent irreversible forward contamination of Mars with life from Earth.",

Guided by a trained art therapist, the open studio welcomes visitors to engage with materials at their own pace while drawing inspiration from the surrounding exhibitions. No art experience is needed; just bring your curiosity and a desire to create, and we'll handle the rest!  Participants are welcome to utilize supplies located in the studio, as well as bring their own supplies/projects to work on.  This group meets on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month, excluding holidays and museum closures. It is open to everyone: students, staff, and the public included! The group will meet in the Roehm Family Art-making Studio, located inside the Simpson Center for Education on the 2nd floor of the Eskenazi Museum of Art.",

    "description": "People around the world have had a fascination with tango since it was first exported from Argentina in the 1910s. Many have been exposed to tango through television shows like Dancing with the Stars, or Hollywood movies ranging from the silent film The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) with Rudolph Valentino dancing to a version of \"La cumparsita,\" to Scent of a Woman (1992) with Al Pacino dancing to Carlos Gardel's \"Por una cabeza,\" and Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dancing to \"Assassin's Tango\" from the movie soundtrack by John Powell. Many musicians are familiar with the music of Astor Piazzolla, whose concert works have become popular in the 20th-century concert repertoire.  In truth, tango is a multidimensional art form that encompasses dance, music, and poetry. In this presentation, I will first highlight these three dimensions, then concentrate on the distinct musical elements that identify the tango music, such as rhythm, instrumentation, phrasing and form, harmony, and melody. Through A/V and score excepts, I will illustrate these musical elements with examples by the early AfroArgentine payador Gabino Ezeiza (1858-1916) and first tango singer Carlos Gardel (1890?–1935); the guardia vieja pioneer Eduardo Arolas (1892–1924); the guardia nueva icon Julio De Caro (1899-1980); the Golden-Age maestro Aníbal Troilo (1914-1975); the post-Golden-Age pillars Horacio Salgán (1916-2016) and Piazzolla (1921-1922); and tango music today in the music of pianist/composer Sonia Possett (b. 1973). Finally, I will discuss recent tango scholarship and field any questions about my work or contributions to the tango archive in the Center for Latin American Music.About the PresenterKristin Wendland earned a B.M. in Theory from Florida State, M.M. in Composition from the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati, and Ph.D. in Music Composition from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. With her research partner Kacey Link, Wendland has published two books on Argentine tango, Tracing Tangueros: Argentine Tango Instrumental Music (Oxford 2016) and The Cambridge Companion to Tango (2024). Through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the two codirected the international Tango in the Humanities Conference &amp; Emory TangoFest in Atlanta in November 2024. Wendland recently published the monograph The Power of Practice: How Music and Yoga Transformed the Life and Work of Yehudi Menuhin (2024) with SUNY Press, which is also available in an open-access digital edition. Wendland served as a teaching professor of music at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, for over 25 years. Now in her retirement, she serves as organist and choirmaster at Christ the King Episcopal Church in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, and directs the Emerald Coast Community Singers. She lives in Freeport, Florida, with her husband Pat and their two cats Chico and Bella.",

    "description": "Q&A with Filmaker Michael Husain and former Pacers Darnell “Dr. Dunk” HIllman and Dave Robisch after the film!\n\n\nAn incredible story of the ABA – a flamboyant rival league to the NBA – and its players. They created much of what the billion dollar NBA is today–the 3-point shot, slam dunk contest, fashion and culture innovators–but then are forgotten in a business deal gone bad.\n\nThe Waiting Game is a powerful documentary that reveals an incredible battle between the NBA and a tiny not-for-profit working to gain full recognition for the men of the ABA. It’s a fight for benefits the players of the ABA felt were promised, but never delivered. While following an investigation of the legal trail of the ABA-NBA merger, key impact journalism and the advocacy for justice, the film reveals the lines that can stand between raw corporate interest and basic human dignity.\n\n“I’m an ABA guy. I got my start there. This is a very important film with a genuine hero at the center.” Bob Costas\n\n“This is the REAL story of the guys I played with and the league that was so important to all of us. It made me cry and it made me proud. I want EVERYONE to see this.” “Dr Dunk” Darnell Hillman, 3-time ABA Champion, Winner of first NBA Slam Dunk Contest\n\n“Here’s me explicitly asking you to please watch Michael Husain’s documentary as soon as possible and recommend it to your nearest NBA fanatic so that they can raise their voice for the legends associated with the ABA.” Pramit Chatterjee, Rotten Tomato Reviewer\n\nRATING: N/A\nLENGTH: 1hr 30min\nFORMAT: DCP",

Bach: Four Preludes and Fugues from \"The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 2\" (BWVv886-89)  Freund: Five Preludes (including the premiere of \"Prelude 2025\")About the ArtistDon Freund is professor of music in composition at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he has been on faculty since 1992. His students from a 50-year teaching career continue to win an impressive array of awards and recognitions. He has been described as \"a composer thoughtful in approach and imaginative in style\" (The Washington Post), whose music is \"exciting, amusing, disturbing, beautiful, and always fascinating\" (Music and Musicians, London). He is an internationally recognized composer with works ranging from solo, chamber, and orchestral music to pieces involving live performances with electronic instruments, music for dance, and large theater works. Many of his works are available on commercial CD. The recipient of numerous awards and commissions, including two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and a Guggenheim Fellowship, Freund has served as guest composer at a vast array of universities and music festivals, and presented master classes throughout Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and South America. He is also active as a pianist, conductor, and lecturer. As a festival coordinator, he has programmed over 1,000 new American works. He has been conductor or pianist in the performance of some 200 new pieces, usually in collaboration with the composer. Freund's piano concert repertoire extends from new music to complete performances of Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier and his own pianistic realizations of Machaut. He has performed his Earthdance Concerto with numerous university wind ensembles. Up-to-date news on works and performances as well as videos, audio files, and pdf scores of over 100 of his compositions can be found at DonFreund.com.

The film did not draw much attention in the States upon initial release, but it has since grown a reputation as a distinctly poetic piece of horror cinema. When it was released in the United States, Eyes Without a Face was re-cut, dubbed into English, and retitled as The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus. This screening will be a 35mm presentation of this version. [81 min; horror; English]",

    "description": "“THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE CELTIC REALM” – The Boston Globe\n\n“A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN” and “THE BEST TRADITIONAL IRISH BAND” – Dolly Parton on her collaboration with Altan on two of her albums Heartsongs (1994) and Little Sparrow (2001)\n\nThe spirit and sound of Altan comes from the deep and rich musical tradition of their native Co. Donegal. On one of his many visits to the Donegal Gaeltacht of Gaoth Dobhair, Belfast born flute player Frankie Kennedy met fiddler and singer Mairead Ní Mhaonaigh, sparking off a deep musical connection, marriage in 1981, and a journey that took them all over the world. Their vision was to bring the unique repertoire of Donegal music to the world and that mission is still as strong as ever.\n\nIn the mid 80s, Mairead and Frankie recruited bouzouki player Ciaran Curran from Fermanagh, whose intricate counterpoint is at the center of the Altan sound, and guitarist Mark Kelly from Dublin, whose mastery of a wide palette of guitar styles and harmonic vocabulary add a breadth and depth of color. As a band, Altan played their first concert on June 1st 1985, in St. John’s Church in Listowel, Co. Kerry at the famous Listowel Writers Week.\n\nTheir first album, simply titled Altan was released in 1987 and quickly followed by Horse with A Heart, which saw the inclusion of Paul O’Saughnessy on fiddle. Paul had joined the band on its first US tours, lending his stunning virtuosity and in-depth knowledge of the Donegal style. He performed on the subsequent three albums. In 1992, the album Harvest Storm brought with it Dáithí Sproule on guitar, himself one of the pioneers of guitar in Irish traditional and folk music, having played with the wonderful Skara Brae with the O’Domhnaill family and Buncrana native Ciaran Tourish who excelled in fiery counterpoint fiddle.\n\nOne of the band’s finest hours came with the release of Island Angel in 1993, which was recognized by Billboard World Music Charts as the second biggest selling world music album globally in 1994 and in the same year, Altan performed for Bill Clinton at the White House. The band would play for US Presidents over the course of their career as well as accompanying Irish Presidents on their state visits. Shortly after the release of this album, the legendary accordionist Dermot Byrne joined the band.\n\nSadly, on September 19th,1994, the band and wider world of music was dealt a devastating blow with the death of founding member Frankie Kennedy. His vision, artistry and sense of fun is still at the heart of Altan and his legacy is carried and celebrated in every note. A record deal with Virgin Records followed in 1996, which catapulted the band on an extensive touring schedule over the subsequent decade. This period saw them working with many of the great American performers such as Dolly Parton, recording on her album Heartsongs (1994) and its follow up, Little Sparrow 2001; she returned the favor on the band’s record The Blue Idol in 2002 by dieting with Mairéad on the song The Pretty Young Girl. The band have traveled with Ireland’s President Mary MacAleese and President Michael D. Higgins on state visits abroad to Japan, North Korea and Italy. President Higgins invited them to join him in his residence, Aras an Uachtaraá in in 2018 to celebrate their 30 years as a band. The Donegal County Council held a civic reception in their offices to mark the occasion in May 2018. In 2006 the Irish Government also honored Altan by putting them on an official postal stamp to celebrate their contribution to the Irish culture one of the highest honors to be bestowed on an Irish citizen.\n\nMartin Tourish a past TG4 Young Musician of the Year, took the accordion seat in late 2013 and the band recorded their album The Widening Gyre in Nashville with many of the great Bluegrass and American performers, such as Mary Chapin Carpenter, Jerry Douglas and Alison Brown. This album explored the connections between Irish and Bluegrass music, a particularly special moment of which was performing at The Grand Ole Opry with Ricky Skaggs in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, the band released their first book, Altan: The Tunes, based on a collection of 222 melodies that they collected recorded over their 30 year history. Martin Tourish transcribed the dance music and meticulously interviewed all the band members for additional stories and background information. Containing a detailed commentary on each of the tunes, it is the only collection of Donegal music currently in print.\n\nMairead Ní Mhaonaigh was awarded Donegal Person of the Year in 2008 and the coveted TG4 Gradaim Ceoil (Music Award) 2017, for her musicianship and singing. The highest accolade which a traditional musician can receive in Ireland.\n\nIn celebration of the band’s latest album, The Gap of Dreams, the band has brought their music all over Europe and Ireland, the US and Canada, Japan, Australia and even North Africa. The latest album celebrates the roots of their music in Donegal folklore. It was recorded in the Attica Studios in the mountains of Donegal which contributed to a wonderful atmosphere which permeated throughout the recording. The title refers to that ‘gap’ or ‘door’ between this and the ‘other world.’ The older fiddlers , whom they got their music from, always associated with the “other world” as the source for their music and inspiration. They would describe poetically about encountering the fairy folk or listening to tunes on the wind or on the shore listening to the sound of the waves.\n\nIn creativity the ‘Gap of Dreams” is never shut. http://www.altan.ie/\n\nwww.facebook.com/altanofficial https://www.facebook.com/altanofficial",

    "description": "Enjoy this performance from almost anywhere in the world viaLIVE@jacobs!About the DirectorsWayne Wallace is professor of practice in jazz studies and jazz trombone at the IU Jacobs School of Music. A seven-time Grammy nominee, he is one of the most respected exponents of African American Latin music in the world today. Wallace is known for his use of traditional forms and styles in combination with contemporary music and has earned wide critical acclaim, including placement in both the trombone and producer categories of the DownBeat Critics Poll. An accomplished arranger, educator, and composer with compositions for film and television, he has received grants from the Creative Work Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Lila Wallace Foundation, and the San Francisco Arts Commission. Wallace has performed, recorded, and studied with many acknowledged masters of the Afro-Latin and jazz idioms, such as Aretha Franklin, Bobby Hutcherson, Earth Wind and Fire, Pete Escovedo, Santana, and many more. This experience has provided a solid foundation for Wallace's current explorations of the intersections of a wealth of cultural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco, Wallace was exposed to blues, country and western, R&amp;B, jazz, and Afro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area shaped his career. His studies of Afro-Latin music and jazz include trips to Cuba, New York City, and Puerto Rico. Widely respected as a teacher and historian, Wallace has taught at San Jos State University, Stanford University, and the Jazzschool in Berkeley. He has conducted lectures, workshops, and clinics in the Americas and Europe since 1983. Head of the critically acclaimed Patois Records, Wallace has created a unique record label with a passionate mission of developing and chronicling the multilingual styles of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene. Under his direction the label has released 13 recordings to critical acclaim, including recordings by Wallace, Marc and Paul van Wageningen, and vocalists Kat Parra, Alexa Weber-Morales, and Kristina. He is an endorser of Conn-Selmer trombones.Andy Miller is lecturer in music in percussion at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, with an emphasis in Latin jazz and Afro-Latin percussion music. An engaging performer and passionate educator, he navigates the diverse world of percussion with technical and musical precision across a broad range of artistic practices. Fostering a deep interest in the percussion music of the African diaspora, Miller has studied with master percussionists in the United States and internationally. A Fulbright grant recipient, Miller studied Afro-Colombian currulao, cumbia, and bullerengue in Colombia with La Wey Segura, Francis Lara, and Emilsen Pacheco, later returning on a Presser Graduate Music Award to study joropo music with Fernando Torres Ramirez. Miller conducted field research in Brazil with Jorge Alabê for his doctoral project, \"The Language of Drumming in Afro-Brazilian Candomblé Ketu.\" His study of bomba percussion, song, and dance took him to Puerto Rico to study with Beto Torrens, Marién Torres, Rafa Maya, and Hector \"Coco\" Baréz. He studied Guinean mande drumming with Bolokada Conde and Afro-Cuban folkloric and popular percussion with Michael Spiro. Miller also champions percussion art music by Latin American composers, including a performance of Ricardo Lorenz's Venezuelan maracas concerto Pataruco with the Jacobs School's University Orchestra. Commissions include Maria José by Luis Fernando Sanchez Gooding, Silent Surface by Rafael Llanos, and Monologue IV: Bilingüismo by José Martinez. His commitment to new music has led to residencies with the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival and the Atlantic Music Festival Contemporary Ensemble. His collaborations with choreographers as a composer/performer have premiered in New York City, throughout the Midwest, and internationally. Miller served as music director of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Dance Department (2017-24), accompanying classes in styles including modern, ballet, West African, and Afro-Latin dance. He previously taught percussion at the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music, Olivet Nazarene University, and Bembé Drum and Dance. Miller earned degrees from IU (D.M.), the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (M.M.), and Wright State University (B.M.). Meeting URL: https://liveatjacobs.music.indiana.edu/",

    "description": "Repertoire  Webern: Langsamer Satz (1905)Beethoven: String Quartet in E-Flat Major, Op. 74 (1809) (\"Harp\")Puccini: Crisantemi (1890)Brahms: String Sextet No. 2 in G Major, Op. 36 (1865)About the Artists  Described by Strad Magazine as being \"vigorous, extrovert and emphatic players with a vitality all their own,\" the young Nisaika Quartet, all barely 20 years old, had just won the Deuxième Prix at the 8e Concours International de Quatuors à Cordes in Evian, France, (later the Bordeaux International String Quartet Competition) from a jury presided by Polish composer Witold Lutosławski and comprising among others cellist Claus Adam (Juilliard String Quartet), Hatto Beyerle (Alban Berg Quartet), Paolo Borciani (Quartetto Italiano), Milan Skampa (Smetana Quartet), and the entire Borodine Quartet. This was in 1983. This foursome of chamber-music-hungry friends and classmates at the Curtis Institute of Music had decided to spend most of the previous year locking themselves into rehearsal studios for marathon work sessions of Mozart, Beethoven, and Bartók. With the support of their coaches, Karen Tuttle and Felix Galimir, they lived one of the great adventures of their musical lives. Being young and in full development, the quartet disbanded to pursue graduate studies and job opportunities, yet somehow remained connected for all these decades, collaborating and performing during summer festivals, subbing for one another during sabbatical and maternity leaves, founding other ensembles. But their association marked them deeply and started defining their identity. Several of the choices they made then were an example of their idealism. At a time where only the Emerson String Quartet traded violin seats, the Nisaika followed suit. They chose a name that was all-inclusive, the word Nisaika meaning \"we, us, our\" in Chinook pidgin, a trading language of the Pacific Northwest, including elements of French, English, Salishan, and other indigenous languages. Violinist David Salness threw a bottle in the ocean a year ago with the idea of a reunion tour in 2025-26, which was pretty rapidly and enthusiastically embraced by the whole group.  An artist deeply dedicated to the range of violin and chamber music repertoire, violinist Violaine Melançon is sought after both as a performer and a pedagogue. She teaches at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University, where she is associate professor of violin, and regularly gives master classes and guest teaches at major peer institutions, including the New England Conservatory in Boston, Glenn Gould School in Toronto, Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and Guildhall School for Music and Drama in London. She served until 2019 on the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. Melançon was, until 2016 and during the ensemble's life span, the founding violinist of the Peabody Trio, ensemble-in-residence at the Peabody Conservatory, and the Yellow Barn Center for Chamber Music, and with them actively performed internationally. These days, she teaches during the summer months at Domaine Forget International Music and Dance Academy, the Green Mountain Chamber Music Festival, and the Summer Violin Institute at Northwestern University Bienen School of Music in Chicago. Melançon performs as well on baroque violin and enjoys collaborating in concert with many Canadian and American early music performers. Her performances can be heard on the Naxos, Artek, CRI, and New World Records labels. Visit www.Melançonmelancon for more information.  Violinist David Salness has attained international recognition as a performing artist and teacher. He has appeared in more than 30 countries and in virtually the entire United States in such renowned venues as Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Orchestra Hall in Chicago, Paris's Salle Gaveau, and London's Wigmore Hall. His performances are broadcast on National Public Radio, Radio France, and the British and Canadian Broadcast Corporations. His recordings are found on the RCA, BMG, Telarc, and Centaur labels, amongst others. Salness was for 12 years a member of the critically acclaimed Audubon Quartet. He has worked with iconic composers, such as Luciano Berio, George Crumb, Krystof Penderecki, Peter Schickele, and John Cage, while premiering countless works throughout his career. A sought-after collaborator, Salness has performed with members of the Guarneri, Cleveland, and Juilliard quartets, and is currently the first violinist with the Left Bank Quartet, appearing frequently in the greater Washington, D.C., area performing in leading venues, including the Kennedy Center, National Gallery, the Smithsonian, and Strathmore Hall. Salness has been concertmaster of Northern Virginia's Fairfax Symphony Orchestra for 28 years. An alumnus of the Interlochen Arts Academy and the Curtis Institute, Salness studied with David Cerone, Jascha Brodsky, Ivan Galamian, Joseph Gingold, and Karen Tuttle. He has served as artist faculty at the Meadowmount School, distinguished teacher of violin at the Brevard Music Center, and chamber music program director at the Chautauqua Festival. The longtime director of chamber music activities at the University of Maryland, he is currently professor of violin.  Violist Ed Gazouleas has emerged as one of the finest teachers of his generation, and his students now populate the viola sections of many orchestras, including the Boston, St. Louis, and Indianapolis symphony orchestras; and many others in the United States, Europe, Asia, and South America. Gazouleas was a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 24 years, where he held the Lois and Harlan Anderson Viola Chair and led the viola section on many occasions, notably with conductors such as Colin Davis, Kurt Masur, and André Previn. While in Boston, he was active in orchestra governance, chairing the orchestra's artistic advisory committee and serving on the search committee that selected Andris Nelsons to be the orchestra's music director. He has had a long association with the Tanglewood Music Center in leadership capacities. As a chamber music performer, Gazouleas has appeared with members of the Fine Arts, Pacifica, Muir, Lydian, and Johannes string quartets, among others. A prizewinner at the Eighth International String Quartet Competition in Evian, France, he has also collaborated with such artists as Christian Tetzlaff, Stephanie Blythe, Roberto Díaz, the Boston Symphony Chamber Players, and the principal string players of the Cleveland Orchestra. Gazouleas works to expand and promote new works for the viola and has collaborated with such composers as Michael Tippett, John Harbison, and Osvaldo Golijov. In 2019, he performed the North American premiere of Letters from Warsaw by English composer Joseph Phibbs. Gazouleas has also served on the faculties of the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as a tenured professor, Boston University College of Fine Arts, Boston Conservatory, Wellesley College, and New England Conservatory. He is also in demand as an orchestral clinician around the country. Gazouleas is a 1984 graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music where he studied viola with Michael Tree and Karen Tuttle. He joined the Curtis faculty in 2017 and was named the Gie and Lisa Liem Artistic Director in 2021 and provost in 2022.Peter Stumpf is professor of music (cello) at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. Prior to this appointment, he was principal cellist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Stumpf's tenure in Los Angeles followed 12 years as associate principal cellist of the Philadelphia Orchestra. His professional orchestral career began at age 16 when he joined the cello section of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. He earned a bachelor's degree from the Curtis Institute of Music (CIM) and an Artist Diploma from the New England Conservatory. A dedicated chamber music musician, he is a member of the Johannes String Quartet and has appeared on chamber music series on several continents. He has performed with the chamber music societies of Boston and Philadelphia and at the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico, as well as such festivals as Marlboro, Spoleto, and Aspen. He has toured with Music from Marlboro, the Casals Hall Ensemble, and pianist Mitsuko Uchida. He has collaborated with pianists Leif Ove Andsnes, Emmanuel Ax, Jorge Bolet, Yefim Bronfman, Radu Lupu, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Andras Schiff, and Jean-Yves Thibaudet, and with the Emerson and Guarneri String Quartets. Concerto appearances have been with the Boston Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, and Boston Philharmonic, among many others. As a recitalist, he has performed at the Universities of Hartford, Syracuse, and Delaware, at Jordan Hall in Boston, and at the Philips and Corcoran Galleries in Washington, D.C. Most recently, he performed J. S. Bach's Six Suites for Solo Cello on series in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. His awards include first prize in the Washington International, Graham-Stahl, and Aspen Concerto Competitions, and second prize in the Evian International String Quartet Competition. As a teacher, he has served on the faculties of the University of Southern California, Hartt School of Music, and New England Conservatory, and he was guest artist faculty at CIM, Yellow Barn Music Festival, and Musicorda Summer String Program.Stephen Wyrczynski is professor of music in viola at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he has been on faculty since 2010. He has been an artist-faculty member at the Aspen Music Festival and School since 2006. Wyrczynski was a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 18 years, joining in 1992. He earned his bachelor degree from The Juilliard School in 1988 and a diploma from the Curtis Institute of Music in 1991. His principal teachers were Kim Kashkashian, Karen Tuttle, and Joseph DePasquale. As a chamber musician, Wyrczynski has performed with such artists as Joshua Bell, Sarah Chang, Pamela Frank, Edgar Meyer, Vladimir Feltsman, and Dawn Upshaw. He has played in many of North America's most celebrated venues as well as at the Aspen Music Festival and School, Colorado; Le Domaine Forget, Quebec; New Port Music Festival, Rhode Island; Grand Teton Music Festival, Wyoming; Tanglewood, Lenox, Massachusetts; Kingston Music Festival, Rhode Island; Casals Music Festival, Puerto Rico; and El Paso Pro Musica, Texas; and with the Apollo Chamber Players, Denver, Colorado. Wyrczynski also performs regularly with his artist faculty colleagues at the Jacobs School of Music and participates in faculty-student collaborations. One such partnership, which he co-founded with colleague Jorja Fleezanis, violin, is an ongoing exploration of music from the Second Viennese School, in which faculty and students together perform music by Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. Wyrczynski considers his teaching a direct result of his own relationship to performing, practicing, and listening. He approaches each student as an individual personality and potential artist. Teaching a student about the great privilege it is to serve the composers of our repertoire is one of the best ways for the students to gain ownership of their musical training. He encourages students to ask probing questions and be musically curious beyond their own instrument.Kam Kin Chen began studying cello at a young age and earned a Bachelor of Music degree at The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts under the guidance of Ray Wang. He is currently pursuing a Master of Music at the Manhattan School of Music, studying with David Geber and Julia Lichten. Chen also has extensive teaching and performance experience. In 2023, he served as resident cellist with the Pacific Cello Orchestra. Prior to that, he taught cello and group classes at Yip's Children's Choral and Performing Arts Centre in 2022 and worked as a cello instructor at Virtuosos Music Academy from 2020 to 2022. Chen was the principal cello for the New York Chamber Players' 2024 performance at Carnegie Weill Recital Hall and appeared as a soloist with the Hong Kong Children's Symphony Orchestra at the Hong Kong City Hall in 2018.

    "description": "Performances of \"Suramaya\" at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  This 30-minute shadow puppet performance by Dr. Jennifer Goodlander tells the tale of a king who sends his servants into the forest to collect supplies for a big party. The king of the forest, Suramaya, does not like his plan. Experience a dynamic story with an environmental message, told with beautiful animal puppets. Appropriate for all ages.About Dr. Jennifer Goodlander  Jennifer Goodlander is an Associate Professor in the Dept. of Theatre, Drama, and Contemporary Dance and Director of the Southeast Asian and ASEAN Studies Center. Jennifer has published numerous articles and two books: Women in the Shadows: Gender, Puppets, and the Power of Tradition in Bali (Ohio University Press, 2016) and Puppets and Cities: Articulating Identities in Southeast Asia (Bloomsbury Methuen Drama, 2018). Jennifer remains active as a director and has performed Balinese wayang kulit, or shadow puppetry, at international festivals and around the United States.Connections to Mulyana: Vital Ecosystems (https://artmuseum.indiana.edu/exhibitions/upcoming/_feature-exhibitions/2026-02-07-mulyana-vital-ecosystems.html)  Mulyana's community-engaged artmaking practice, performances, and immersive installations reinvent Indonesia's enduring tradition of shadow puppetry (wayang kulit). Wayang combines engaging storytelling, music, spirituality, and a range of different characters. Alluding to this theatrical apparatus, Mulyana invents his own distinct octopus-monster characters (Mogus) to populate his fantastical textile ecosystems. His dramatic use of light and shadow further evokes the atmospheric quality of shadow puppet performances. Consistent with this tradition, Mulyana: Vital Ecosystems fosters community gathering and conveys a powerful message about social wellbeing.Know Before You Go:  This event is part of the First Thursdays festivals showcase (https://artsandhumanities.indiana.edu/council-programs/first-thursdays/index.html).

What does the slave narrative of James Williams (1838) mask, for example? What of Edmonia Lewis's sculpture Forever Free (1867) or John Gast's painting American Progress (1872)? Turning on the central question of \"who is responsible for remembering,\" each work resists illegibility by withholding the unspeakable and the unspoken. &#160;  Lecture will be held until 5 pm followed by questions. Reception to follow.&#160;Sponsored by the Robert E. &amp; Avis Tarrant Burke Lecture Fund.",

    "description": "Join the Jacobs School of Music for an evening filled with true love and magic on March 6th and 7th in their production of Jules Massenet's Cendrillon.\n\nIn contrast with Rossini’s version, the glass slipper is back in this French grand opera rendition of one of the most beloved fairy tales, based on Charles Perrault’s Cinderella. Here, Massenet lets us see a daughter’s immense grief—at the loss of her mother, their home, and her place in the family after her father’s remarriage. Yet her remarkable ability to not only survive but to forgive allows her to ultimately triumph. Who can resist the desire to believe that dreams really can come true and to cheer for our heroine as she overcomes the abuse of her stepfamily to find her soulmate? (And who couldn’t use a Fairy Godmother?)",

    "description": "SCHEDULE OF EVENTS:9:00-11:30 │Historical Panel: \"Music and Cold-War Diplomacy\"  Kevin Bartig, \"Behind the Iron Curtain Before the Iron Curtain: Western Musicians in the Soviet Union During the Interwar Period\"In this presentation, I reconstruct the largely forgotten activities of foreign musicians and critics in Soviet Russia during the interwar period. Through concert tours and residencies, these visitors moved information and ideas across borders, shaped Soviet musical self-identity, and effected a form of cultural exchange that prefigures—and complicates conventional narratives of—later Cold War musical exchange with the Soviet Union.  Bess Liu, \"'Big Brother is Listening!' Music, Friendship, and the Sino-Soviet Relations during the Korean War (1950-1953)\"This project studies the negotiated musicianship as represented by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association (SSFA) in Dalian, China, during the Korean War (1950-1953). Musical diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union, at this critical historical moment, entails contrasting stories between genuine inter-personal friendship and intricate interstate politics within the Communist world.  Grace Pechianu, \"Diplomacy in the Ether: Radio Free Europe and Romanian Exiles as Jazz Ambassadors\"The defected jazz pianist Eugen Ciceu credited jazz programs from Voice of America, Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Europe for shaping his musicianship in socialist Romania. This talk follows Ciceu's trajectory as a consumer-turned-contributor of American counterpropaganda on his Radio Free Europe interview and performance from 1964 while assessing radio's role in enabling exiles to serve as cultural diplomats.  Lynn Hooker, \"State Folk Ensembles: Shock Troops of the Cultural Cold War or Cash Cow?\"Across the East Bloc and elsewhere, staged folkdance groups were some of the most prominent representatives of the culture of socialist states. As well as being cultural diplomats, they earned important income from Western audiences. Press coverage and oral histories from the Hungarian League of Young Communists' Rajkó Ensemble reveal the complexities of this role.  Danielle Lussier-Fosler, \"The Market Effects of Propaganda: Government Money and the 'New Music' Boom\"When the US government used music as propaganda, the effects of those programs were noticeable at home as well as abroad. Despite claims that the government did not subsidize the arts, government funding for music propaganda established strong incentives for the creation, publication, and recording of contemporary concert music.11:45-12:45 │ \"Conversations with Experts: Preserving Cultural Heritage with UNESCO Programs\"  Julius Heinicke and Iryna Voloshyna2:00-3:00 │ \"Conversations with Experts: Building Peace through Business Initiatives\"  Timothy Fort and John Katsos4:30-5:30 │ \"Conversations with Experts: Connecting Culture and Policy with U.S. State Department\"  Mark Katz and Paul Kruchoski  &#160;PARTICIPANT BIOSKevin Bartig is Professor of Musicology at Michigan State University.

    "description": "Join the Jacobs School of Music for an evening filled with true love and magic on March 6th and 7th in their production of Jules Massenet's Cendrillon.\n\nIn contrast with Rossini’s version, the glass slipper is back in this French grand opera rendition of one of the most beloved fairy tales, based on Charles Perrault’s Cinderella. Here, Massenet lets us see a daughter’s immense grief—at the loss of her mother, their home, and her place in the family after her father’s remarriage. Yet her remarkable ability to not only survive but to forgive allows her to ultimately triumph. Who can resist the desire to believe that dreams really can come true and to cheer for our heroine as she overcomes the abuse of her stepfamily to find her soulmate? (And who couldn’t use a Fairy Godmother?)",

Alcohol, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, and illicit drugs are prohibited at IU Cinema.\n\nAs nervy as it is hilarious, this screwball masterpiece from Ernst Lubitsch stars Jack Benny and, in her final screen appearance, Carole Lombard as husband-and-wife thespians in Nazi-occupied Warsaw who become caught up in a dangerous spy plot. To Be or Not to Be is a Hollywood film of the boldest black humor, which went into production right before the U.S. entered World War II. Lubitsch manages to brilliantly balance political satire, romance, slapstick, and wartime suspense in a comic high-wire act that has never been equaled.

In East of Eden, the 24-year-old idol-to-be plays Cal, a wayward Salinas Valley youth who, along with his competitive brother Aron (Richard Davalos), vies for the affection of his hardened father (Raymond Massey), making for a tragic Cain and Abel story. Playing off the haunting sensitivity of Julie Harris, Dean's performance earned one of the film's four Academy Award nominations, which included stellar performances throughout, including that of Jo Van Fleet who won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.

This multilayered, noirish descent into one man’s personal hell is also a surreal, metacinematic journey that, two years after the phenomenon Se7en, further demonstrated that director David Fincher was one of Hollywood’s true contemporary visionaries.

Featuring guest artists Snehesh Nag, sitar, and Sutanu Sur, tablaRepertoire  Reena Esmail: This Love Between Us (2016)About the Artists  Recognized with The American Prizes in both Choral Composition (2014) and Choral Performance (2019, with NOTUS), Dominick DiOrio is an imaginative, enthusiastic, and energetic conductor and composer who has won widespread acclaim for his contributions to American music. He is professor of music and chair of the department in choral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he joined the faculty in 2012, and where he serves as director of NOTUS, IU's storied contemporary vocal ensemble, which has been invited to perform at regional, national, and international choral conferences, and with which he has released three commercial albums to critical acclaim. DiOrio also serves as artistic director and conductor of the Mendelssohn Chorus of Philadelphia, which he regularly prepares to sing with The Philadelphia Orchestra. DiOrio's love for contemporary music is reflected in his conducted repertoire, including works by such path-breaking composers as James MacMillan, Steve Reich, and Krzysztof Penderecki. Guest conducting appearances frequently feature his original compositions, including with the Choral Arts Society of Washington (SOLARIS), Houston Chamber Choir (I Am), Choral Arts Initiative (All Is), and the Young Naperville Singers (Young Today). As a composer, DiOrio has been hailed for a keenly intelligent, evocative style, which shows \"a tour de force of inventive thinking and unique colour\" (Gramophone). His over 70 published works have appeared at major venues around the world, including the Sydney Opera House, Lincoln Center, and Carnegie Hall. He composes for musicians of all ages and experiences and maintains an active writing schedule—completing over 70 commissions in the last decade. Recent commissioning partners include the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus and the San Francisco Symphony, Children's Chorus of Washington, The Choral Arts Society of Washington, and \"The President's Own\" United States Marine Band. DiOrio earned a Doctor of Musical Arts degree in conducting from the Yale School of Music, as well as M.M.A. and M.M. degrees in conducting from Yale and a B.M. in composition summa cum laude from Ithaca College.Reena Esmail's music weaves together the traditions of Hindustani and Western classical music, drawing musicians from many perspectives into shared creative spaces. Esmail divides her attention evenly between orchestral, chamber, and choral work. She has written commissions for ensembles including the Los Angeles Master Chorale, Seattle Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, and San Francisco Symphony, and her music has been featured on multiple Grammy-nominated albums, including The Singing Guitar by Conspirare, BRUITS by Imani Winds, and Healing Modes by Brooklyn Rider. Many of her choral works are published by Oxford University Press, and her piece TaReKiTa has sold over 100,000 copies worldwide. Her life and music was profiled on Season 3 of the PBS Great Performances series Now Hear This, as well as Frame of Mind, a podcast from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Esmail was the Los Angeles Master Chorale's 2020-25 Swan Family Artist-in-Residence and was Seattle Symphony's 2020-21 Composer-in-Residence. She has been in residence with Tanglewood Music Center (2023 co-curator), Spoleto Festival (chamber music composer-in-residence, 2024), and Marlboro Music Festival (2025 composer-in-residence). Esmail earned degrees in composition from The Juilliard School (B.M. '05) and the Yale School of Music (M.M. '11, M.M.A. '14, D.M.A. '18). Her primary teachers include Susan Botti, Aaron Jay Kernis, Christopher Theofanidis, Christopher Rouse, and Samuel Adler. She received a Fulbright-Nehru grant to study Hindustani music in India. Her Hindustani music teachers include Srimati Lakshmi Shankar and Gaurav Mazumdar, and she currently studies and collaborates with Saili Oak. Her doctoral thesis, \"Finding Common Ground: Uniting Practices in Hindustani and Western Art Musicians,\" explores the methods and challenges of the collaborative process between Hindustani musicians and Western composers. Esmail resides in her hometown of Los Angeles, California.Harmony and Power: A Summit on Cultural DiplomacyPresented by the Hamilton Lugar School and Jacobs School of Music  With panel discussions, presentations, workshops, and concerts, Harmony and Power will explore how cultural diplomacy shapes power and global connections.

A. Mozart: Double Piano Concerto, K.365R. Schumann: Symphony No. 1, Op. 38 (\"Spring\")About the Conductor  Celebrated for his \"imagination, devotion and supreme musicianship\" (Los Angeles Times), Jeffrey Kahane is now in the fifth decade of an expansive and eclectic musical career. As a pianist, conductor, and scholar, his career highlights run the gamut from concertos with the New York Philharmonic and San Francisco Symphony to recitals with Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell and European tours at the podium of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, along with countless lectures and artistic collaborations. During his 20 seasons as music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, he led the orchestra on tours of the United States and Europe. He was instrumental in the creation of several new series. In addition to the dozens of works commissioned or premiered by the orchestras where he has served as music director, Kahane has premiered piano concertos written for him by composers Kevin Puts and Andrew Norman. He has also given many performances of Heirloom, a new concerto written for him by Gabriel Kahane, as a way of tracing the connections between music and three generations of family history. He served as music director of the newly re-formed San Antonio Philharmonic for two seasons and of the Sarasota Music Festival for nine seasons. When not on the road, he teaches a small class of gifted pianists and coaches chamber music at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music and occasionally guest conducts the USC Thornton Symphony.

    "description": "The Silkroad Ensemble's latest flagship program with Artistic Director Rhiannon Giddens is Sanctuary: The Power of Resonance and Ritual. In this program, Giddens and the ensemble explore how to experience music to better understand the world, find comfort, process loss in a changing environment, and rebuild community based on humanity. Historically, when people have found themselves in a time of conflict or stress, they have always turned to music.  &#160;  The idea of trance, something that can bring a deep peace that is hard to find in modern society, is profoundly tied to the communal music-making traditions found in many different cultures, from Morocco to India to Ireland, and is a way to build a stronger human connection amidst all the noise. In Sanctuary: The Power of Resonance and Ritual, the musicians will delve deeply into one another's music and traditions, such as Sicilian tarantella with Mauro Durante and Francesco Turrisi, Moroccan gnawa with Mehdi Nassouli, Indian classical music with Sandeep Das, American old-time with Giddens on banjo, and more, and invite audiences to join them as partners and participants in the performance, instead of solely as passive bystanders.",

    "description": "It's never a bad time to make new friends! Come make art and meet others with common interests during our monthly friend-finding art group, Palette Pals!  Sessions will include art prompts meant to help build connection with others, but if you just want to flex your creative muscles and make what you like, feel free to bring your own art supplies and create something while in the company of others!  This group meets on the 3rd Thursday of every month, excluding holidays and museum closures. It is open to everyone: students, staff, and the public included! The group will meet in the Roehm Family Art-making Studio, located inside the Simpson Center for Education on the 2nd floor of the Eskenazi Museum of Art.",

    "description": "A great deal of misinformation has been spread – particularly by our current President and Secretary of Health and Human Services – about the reasons for the rapid rise in diagnosed cases of autism spectrum disorder over the past half-century. Professors Emeritus Tim Londergan and Steve Vigdor will review the expansion of diagnostic criteria for the neurodevelopmental condition(s) known as autism, and how these diagnostic changes have contributed to the rise. They will also show that the totality of epidemiological studies establish no link between autism and vaccines and at most a weak association (not necessarily causal) with prenatal Tylenol usage. Extensive twin studies have established a dominant role for genetics and a minor role for environmental conditions in contributing to autism. Ongoing brain imaging studies of people on the autism spectrum are revealing atypical connectivity issues that are associated with some autistic behaviors.",

He is professor of orchestral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as well as artistic partner with the Northwest Sinfonietta, one of the northwest United States' most vibrantly creative ensembles. Artistic director of the St. Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic for two decades, his work with the orchestra was noted for its breadth and innovation. His programming has earned three ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming and two Vytautas Marijošius Memorial Awards. A champion of contemporary music, Meyer imagines the orchestra experience as a forum for story, emotion, and civic dialogue. His projects have paired symphonic works with multimedia visionaries and diverse cultural collaborators. His recordings span repertoire from baroque to the present; his most recent, Illuminations: Music of Narong Prangcharoen, was released by Albany Records in 2023. Recent highlights include a multimedia Rite of Spring and Petrushka with the Thailand Philharmonic; Carlos Simon's Graffiti with renowned graffiti artists; a theatrical symphonic concert developed in collaboration with Daniel Bernard Roumain and Marc Bamuthi Joseph; Laura Kaminsky's Piano Concerto with Ursula Oppens (Cedille Records); a semistaged production of Nkeiru Okoye's Invitation to a Die-In; and multiple collaborations with the American Composers Orchestra's EarShot program. Recent and upcoming engagements include the City Chamber Orchestra of Hong Kong, Los Angeles Ballet, Xalapa Symphony, Orquesta Juvenil Universitaria Eduardo Mata, American Composers Orchestra, Texas Festival Orchestra at Round Top, and returns to the Grossman Ensemble, Sichuan Symphony, and Thailand Philharmonic. Passionate about working with young musicians and music education, Meyer is an active adjudicator, guest clinician, and master class teacher. Prior to his appointment at the Jacobs School, he led acclaimed orchestral programs at Arizona State University and Ithaca College. He has given master classes throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Meyer holds degrees in piano and composition and earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in Piano Performance with Gilbert Kalish at Stony Brook University.

To protect her and their six-year-old Deaf daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), Curtis starts focusing his anxiety and money into the obsessive building of a storm shelter. While Hannah's healthcare and special needs education has resulted in financial struggle, Curtis' seemingly inexplicable behavior concerns Samantha and provokes intolerance among co-workers, friends and neighbors. However, the resulting strain on his marriage and tension within the community doesn't compare to Curtis' private fear of what his disturbing dreams may truly signify. [121 min; drama, thriller; English]\n\nA Q&A with actor Michael Shannon and Joshua Coonrod (Assistant Teaching Professor of English and Communication, Missouri University of Science and Technology) will follow the screening.",

    "description": "This talk will consider the ways that famed Black American conceptual artist David Hammons cites, leverages, and operationalizes white, western canons to probe the generative limits of art historical discourse and canonization. The artist's intentional engagement with the practices and legacies of artists whose oeuvres have formed an avant-garde western canon like Duchamp, Klein, Matta-Clark, is not about mere adoration, but in fact a strategic assessment, if not deformation, of art historical discourses. Operating like a trojan horse, Hammons has seamlessly created opportunities for alignment and association, making it so that named collectors of Duchamp and museums that collect Matta-Clark have incomplete collections if they do not own a work by Hammons. This project will work alongside two key Hammons works, The Holy Bible: Old Testament (2002) and Days End (2021) to consider how the artist breaks disciplinary canons in order to make radically renewed associations.  &#160;  Lecture will be held until 5 pm followed by questions. Reception to follow.Sponsored by the Robert E. &amp; Avis Tarrant Burke Lecture Fund.",

    "description": "In Michael Shannon’s directorial debut—adapted from Brett Neveu’s 2002 renowned stage play—a mother struggles to cope in the aftermath of a shocking crime at the hands of her son. Janice (Judy Greer) is struggling, moving through life as if in a haze and unable to let go of her anger and frustration following her son's violent and shocking crimes. While her husband (Alexander Skarsgård) has found refuge at a new church, Janice finds it hard to seek solace in her faith despite her pastor’s pleas to heal her wounds by meeting with the mothers of her son’s victims. As Janice ponders her role in the community, she questions whether there is any established path to healing from an experience such as hers. Eric LaRue asks audiences to witness the frayed emotional ripples violent acts can engender. [119 min; drama; English]\n\nJoin award-winning writer Brett Neveu and award-winning actor/director Michael Shannon for an intimate and wide-ranging conversation on the art of collaboration and all points between. Please note this program will encompass a brief onstage conversation, followed by the film and then a post-film Q&A.",

    "description": "Michael Shannon and Ashley Judd give searing performances in this skin-crawling exercise in fear and paranoia from director William Friedkin. Oklahoma waitress Aggie (Judd) lives a largely solitary life in a rundown motel. She's haunted by a tragic past and hounded by her ex-con ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.). When she sparks a romance with an eccentric drifter, Peter Evans (Shannon), she starts to feel hopeful again—until Peter reveals he is a victim of government experimentation. The couple begins to obsess over the nightmarish idea that they are infected by insects. Shannon reprises the role he originated in playwright Tracy Letts' original London production of the same name. [102 min; drama, thriller, horror; English]",

    "description": "Un/Filmed is an international documentary film development project and a regular partner with the Byrnes Institute at IU focused on preserving the tradition of independent documentary filmmaking among Russian-speakers, and to provide competitive workshops for participants with the opportunity to create films reflecting on pressing social issues. This program is showcasing the top six films of the 2024-2025 cohort with subtitles presented in English.\n\nLike Mother, Like Daughter (dir. Sofia Sedlova, 2025, Russia and France): Yana—who’s unexpectedly pregnant—and her daughter Liza await their papers in a Paris suburb. Uncertainty sparks personal crises for Yana and forces Liza to grow up too fast. Their roles reverse in this small family, but together they’ll face the challenges ahead. [7 min; Russian and French with English subtitles]\n\nWe're Fine (dir. Daria Yurishcheva, 2025, Russia and France): Two old acquaintances share an apartment in Marseille by force of circumstances. The talkative Ukrainian Andrii is forced to take care of the gloomy Russian Filipp. The migrant's instability will not make Andrii lose his optimism. [16 min; Russian and French with English subtitles]\n\nShe Became a Pillar of Salt (dir. Xenia Vasilkova, 2025, Russia): A Russian filmmaker and her Ukrainian friend rebuild their lives in Armenia after fleeing their homelands. As war draws all apart, we uncover quiet echoes between them. [15 min; Russian with English subtitles]\n\nUneasy Living (dir. Nikita Nadezhdin, 2025, Russia): A Russian, staunchly against war, flees to Georgia after protest detentions, battling depression and scorn from traditional society while scavenging in dumpsters and aiding stray cats. Through quiet acts of kindness, he searches for life's meaning. This intimate documentary explores hope, humanity, and defiance against outdated norms. [15 min; Russian with English subtitles]\n\nKozlov Mitya, 81+ (dir. Yulia Ruzmanova, 2025, Russia): What matters most in relationships in your 80s: a hug, a sack of potatoes, a kind word, or simply having someone to spend New Year’s Eve with? This is a road trip with Mitya Kozlov and his dog as he visits his girlfriends, searching for an answer to this question. [17 min; Russian with English subtitles]\n\nMemory is Me? (dir. Vlada Lodesk, 2025, Russia): To get acquainted with her deceased dad, whom she never met, a filmmaker follows the traces of him in her mother’s memories and the artifacts that are left behind. Along the way, she writes letters to her father—letters that cannot be sent. [15 min; Russian with English subtitles]",

She works both in the United States where she lives and the Middle East where she is from, to focus on notions of identity and individuality all within the context of the underlying universality of these experiences.About the Curator:  Elliot Josephine Leila Reichert is an American curator, critic, and editor. She is the inaugural Curator of Contemporary Art at the Eskenazi Museum of Art at Indiana University and was a 2023-24 Propel Fellow with the Association of Art Museum Curators Foundation.

    "description": "In this workshop, we begin by looking closely at artwork—asking what we see, think, feel, and wonder. Together, we'll explore the artist's possible message and its social meaning, then turn those reflections into our own creative responses.  Whether you're a writer or simply curious to try something new, you'll find inspiration here and a welcoming community to share the journey.  About the Exhibition  Step into the world of acclaimed photographer Rania Matar (b. 1964, Lebanon), whose striking portraits document young women persisting in uncertain times. Matar's lens highlights women's creativity, strength, dignity, and resilience—offering a powerful counter-narrative to the challenges of her country and region.

Along with guitar, she plays her own compositions on Native flute. Fabian Fontenelle (Zuni/Omaha), Shelley’s husband and musical partner, adds breathtaking and beautiful traditional Northern Plains dancing, storytelling, and drumming. An original member of the American Indian Dance Theater, he has also recorded early 20th-century songs written by his Zuni grandmother. Shelley and Fabian live in the Zuni Pueblo in northwestern New Mexico, and through their music, stories, and dance, “they hope to bring education, peace, love, and unity” to all.",

With an irreverent book, an astonishing set, and a score that's out of this Netherworld, Beetlejuice is \"screamingly good fun\" (Variety).

All ages and experience levels are welcome!  Come and go at your own pace. We recommend planning for at least an hour to explore the gallery and make art.  Start in the Art Studio inside the Kimberly and John Simpson Center for Education on the museum's 2nd floor to pick up your Gallery Challenge. Then head to the galleries to find the artwork we'll use as inspiration for our project! When you're ready, head back to the studio for our hands-on art-making activity that everyone will love.  This program takes place every Second Sunday of the month, excluding holidays and museum closures. Each month features new artworks and materials, so there's always something fresh to explore and create!  All children must be chaperoned.Know Before You Go:Read about where to find us, where to park, accessibility, and museum guidelines.Strollers are welcome in the galleries. When carrying small children, please keep them in front of you.  To save time at the lockers, avoid bringing backpacks or large bags.  When You Arrive:If you parked in the IMU parking lot, Guest Services can validate your parking voucher for a discount.  Store any large bags in the lockers behind the Guest Services desk.  Head upstairs to the 2nd Floor and into the Simpson Center for Education to start.  When in the galleries, do not touch the artwork. Be mindful to keep body parts and anything you're carrying at least 18\" away from the art.  Photography is welcome! Just no flash or selfie sticks.",

    "description": "Five Friends Master Class Series – Honoring Zachary NovakThe Five Friends Master Class Series honoring the lives of five talented Jacobs School of Music students—Chris Carducci, Garth Eppley, Georgina Joshi, Zachary Novak, and Robert Samels—was established in 2012 with a gift of $1 million from the Georgina Joshi Foundation, Inc. This annual series of lectures, master classes, and residencies by a number of the world's leading musicians and teachers focuses on areas of interest most relevant to the lives of the five friends—voice performance, choral conducting, early music, music theory, composition, and opera. The Georgina Joshi Foundation was established in 2007 as the vision of Georgina Joshi's mother, Louise Addicott-Joshi, to provide educational and career development opportunities for young musicians and to encourage and support public performance of music. The gift to the school establishes a permanent way for the world to learn about each of the five friends, their musical talents and passions, and to encourage the development of similar talents and passions in current and future music students. The establishment of this endowment by the families is administered by the IU Foundation.Zachary Novak showed his enthusiasm for music at a young age, playing piano and organ, singing, and conducting. He put his talents to use as a musician for several churches throughout high school and college. Zachary was known for his sharp intellect, exceptional work ethic, and dazzling smile. He had a deep passion for music which he expressed through his conducting and vibrant tenor voice. His thirst for knowledge and a compelling desire for excellence were clearly evident by the way Zachary lived his life. He graduated summa cum laude from Anderson University (AU) in 2004, with honors in music. In 2003, Zachary received the AU music department's Voice Performance Award and the Theodore Presser Award. He also won the senior men's category at the State National Association of Teacher's Singing Award, along with many other accolades. After graduating from AU, Zachary performed professionally as the featured soloist for the Anderson Symphony Orchestra, the Bach Chorale Singers in Lafayette, Indiana, the Carmel Bach Festival in California, as well as other various venues. He went on to earn a Master of Music in Choral Conducting with a minor in Voice from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. Late Thursday night April 20, 2006, Zachary, along with four other IU students, died in a plane crash on their way back to Bloomington from a Bach chorale rehearsal in Lafayette, Indiana. Those friends were Garth Epply (M.M. in Voice Performance at IU), born February 7, 1981, who also attended AU with Zachary, Chris Carducci (M.M. in Voice Performance at IU) born April 18, 1978, Georgina Joshi (M.M. in Voice Performance at IU), born October 21, 1981, and Robert Samels (D.M. in Choral Conducting at IU), born June 2, 1981. All five musicians were known for their passion for life and music. All are deeply missed, but their memory and music live on.",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes.

Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

Come learn how Romanian exiles undermined political and cultural isolationism while advocating for individual agency and creativity within a democratic, free market society.  Grace Pechianu is a doctoral candidate in musicology at Indiana University, Bloomington. Her research considers networks of Romanian exiles and defected musicians, their role as contributors to Radio Free Europe, and role in facilitating communication with Romanians behind the Iron Curtain.",

    "description": "About the DirectorsWayne Wallace is professor of practice in jazz studies and jazz trombone at the IU Jacobs School of Music. A seven-time Grammy nominee, he is one of the most respected exponents of African American Latin music in the world today. Wallace is known for his use of traditional forms and styles in combination with contemporary music and has earned wide critical acclaim, including placement in both the trombone and producer categories of the DownBeat Critics Poll. An accomplished arranger, educator, and composer with compositions for film and television, he has received grants from the Creative Work Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Lila Wallace Foundation, and the San Francisco Arts Commission. Wallace has performed, recorded, and studied with many acknowledged masters of the Afro-Latin and jazz idioms, such as Aretha Franklin, Bobby Hutcherson, Earth Wind and Fire, Pete Escovedo, Santana, and many more. This experience has provided a solid foundation for Wallace's current explorations of the intersections of a wealth of cultural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco, Wallace was exposed to blues, country and western, R&amp;B, jazz, and Afro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area shaped his career. His studies of Afro-Latin music and jazz include trips to Cuba, New York City, and Puerto Rico. Widely respected as a teacher and historian, Wallace has taught at San José State University, Stanford University, and the Jazzschool in Berkeley. He has conducted lectures, workshops, and clinics in the Americas and Europe since 1983. Head of the critically acclaimed Patois Records, Wallace has created a unique record label with a passionate mission of developing and chronicling the multilingual styles of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene. Under his direction the label has released 13 recordings to critical acclaim, including recordings by Wallace, Marc and Paul van Wageningen, and vocalists Kat Parra, Alexa Weber-Morales, and Kristina. He is an endorser of Conn-Selmer trombones.Andy Miller is lecturer in music in percussion at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, with an emphasis in Latin jazz and Afro-Latin percussion music. An engaging performer and passionate educator, he navigates the diverse world of percussion with technical and musical precision across a broad range of artistic practices. Fostering a deep interest in the percussion music of the African diaspora, Miller has studied with master percussionists in the United States and internationally. A Fulbright grant recipient, Miller studied Afro-Colombian currulao, cumbia, and bullerengue in Colombia with La Wey Segura, Francis Lara, and Emilsen Pacheco, later returning on a Presser Graduate Music Award to study joropo music with Fernando Torres Ramirez. Miller conducted field research in Brazil with Jorge Alabê for his doctoral project, \"The Language of Drumming in Afro-Brazilian Candomblé Ketu.\" His study of bomba percussion, song, and dance took him to Puerto Rico to study with Beto Torrens, Marién Torres, Rafa Maya, and Hector \"Coco\" Baréz. He studied Guinean mande drumming with Bolokada Conde and Afro-Cuban folkloric and popular percussion with Michael Spiro. Miller also champions percussion art music by Latin American composers, including a performance of Ricardo Lorenz's Venezuelan maracas concerto Pataruco with the Jacobs School's University Orchestra. Commissions include Maria José by Luis Fernando Sanchez Gooding, Silent Surface by Rafael Llanos, and Monologue IV: Bilingüismo by José Martinez. His commitment to new music has led to residencies with the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival and the Atlantic Music Festival Contemporary Ensemble. His collaborations with choreographers as a composer/performer have premiered in New York City, throughout the Midwest, and internationally. Miller served as music director of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Dance Department (2017-24), accompanying classes in styles including modern, ballet, West African, and Afro-Latin dance. He previously taught percussion at the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music, Olivet Nazarene University, and Bembé Drum and Dance. Miller earned degrees from IU (D.M.), the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (M.M.), and Wright State University (B.M.).",

    "description": "Repertoire  Quinn Mason: Serenade (2025)Jessie Montgomery: Five Freedom Songs (2018)John Adams: Shaker Loops (1978/83)About the Artists  Distinguished for insightful performances, visionary programming, and wide-ranging collaborations, conductor Jeffery Meyer has captivated audiences around the globe. He is professor of orchestral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as well as artistic partner with the Northwest Sinfonietta, one of the northwest United States' most vibrantly creative ensembles. Artistic director of the St. Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic for two decades, his work with the orchestra was noted for its breadth and innovation. His programming has earned three ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming and two Vytautas Marijošius Memorial Awards. A champion of contemporary music, Meyer imagines the orchestra experience as a forum for story, emotion, and civic dialogue. His projects have paired symphonic works with multimedia visionaries and diverse cultural collaborators. His recordings span repertoire from baroque to the present; his most recent, Illuminations: Music of Narong Prangcharoen, was released by Albany Records in 2023. Recent highlights include a multimedia Rite of Spring and Petrushka with the Thailand Philharmonic; Carlos Simon's Graffiti with renowned graffiti artists; a theatrical symphonic concert developed in collaboration with Daniel Bernard Roumain and Marc Bamuthi Joseph; Laura Kaminsky's Piano Concerto with Ursula Oppens (Cedille Records); a semistaged production of Nkeiru Okoye's Invitation to a Die-In; and multiple collaborations with the American Composers Orchestra's EarShot program. Recent and upcoming engagements include the City Chamber Orchestra of Hong Kong, Los Angeles Ballet, Xalapa Symphony, Orquesta Juvenil Universitaria Eduardo Mata, American Composers Orchestra, Texas Festival Orchestra at Round Top, and returns to the Grossman Ensemble, Sichuan Symphony, and Thailand Philharmonic. Passionate about working with young musicians and music education, Meyer is an active adjudicator, guest clinician, and master class teacher. Prior to his appointment at the Jacobs School, he led acclaimed orchestral programs at Arizona State University and Ithaca College. He has given master classes throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Meyer holds degrees in piano and composition and earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in Piano Performance with Gilbert Kalish at Stony Brook University.Tichina Vaughn is associate professor of music in voice at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. A Grammy Award-winning American mezzo-soprano, celebrated for her \"superb, rich singing\" and serious \"theatrical presence,\" Vaughn began her international operatic career as a member of the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Program. Recent successes have included her debut at the Welsh National Opera as Zia Principessa and Zita (Il Trittico), her Royal Opera House Covent Garden debut as the Witch (Hansel and Gretel), Azucena (Il Trovatore) for Piedmont Opera, as well as returning to the Metropolitan Opera as the Hostess of the Inn (Boris Gudonow), and roles in Dialogues de Carmélites, Elektra, and Porgy and Bess. Upcoming engagements include her return to the Semperoper as the Old Lady in Candide, mezzo soloist in Verdi's Requiem with the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, and Maria in Porgy and Bess with the Metropolitan Opera. Further international engagements have included appearances with Alan Gilbert at the Lucerne Festival in Porgy and Bess and her debut at the Opéra National de Lyon as Old Lady (Candide). In North America, Vaughn recently appeared as Amneris (Aida) at Fort Worth Opera and Cincinnati Opera and made her Opera Theatre of Saint Louis debut as Monisha in Scott Joplin's Treemonisha. From 2010 to 2018 she was an ensemble member at the Semperoper Dresden, where she was heard as Herodias (Salome), Azucena (Il Trovatore), Venus (Tannhäuser), Ulrica (Un Ballo in Maschera), and Ortrud (Lohengrin), among others. From 1996 to 2006 she was a principal artist at the Stuttgart State Opera, where she was awarded the title of Kammersängerin for her successes in such roles as Eboli (Don Carlo), Widow Begbick (Mahagonny), Venus (Tannhäuser), Giulietta (Tales of Hoffmann), Arnalta (L'incoronazione di Poppea), Fricka (Die Walküre), Waltraute (Götterdämmerung), and Erda (Siegfried and Das Rheingold). Her discography includes the Grammy-winning Metropolitan Opera recording of Porgy and Bess, Stuttgart State Theater's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and her solo CD, Christmas at My House.",

The dramatic 250-foot long mural, which originally wrapped around the entire exhibition hall at the World's Fair, depicts the social, economic, and cultural history of Indiana from mound building to the 1930s. After several years of storage following the fair, the panels were given to Indiana University in 1938, where they were installed in three locations on the Bloomington campus.&#160;About Your Guide:  Jim Davis is a Senior Lecturer in the Kelley School of Business, in the department of Management and Entrepreneurship.

Then head to the galleries to find the artwork we'll use as inspiration for our project! When you're ready, head back to the studio for our hands-on art-making activity that everyone will love.  This program takes place every Second Sunday of the month, excluding holidays and museum closures. Each month features new artworks and materials, so there's always something fresh to explore and create!  All children must be chaperoned.Know Before You Go:Read about where to find us, where to park, accessibility, and museum guidelines.Strollers are welcome in the galleries. When carrying small children, please keep them in front of you.  To save time at the lockers, avoid bringing backpacks or large bags.

Head upstairs to the 2nd Floor and into the Simpson Center for Education to start.  When in the galleries, do not touch the artwork. Be mindful to keep body parts and anything you're carrying at least 18\" away from the art.  Photography is welcome! Just no flash or selfie sticks.",

    "description": "Constellation Stage & Screen presents “Finn: A New Musical- At the PB&J Cafe,” on stage May 1-17 at the Waldron Auditorium.\n\nFrom the creator of Doc McStuffins and Vampirina, Finn is a heartwarming musical adventure about a young shark on the brink of growing up. As he prepares to join the fearsome Shark Guard, Finn can’t shake the feeling that he’s different from the other sharks. Deep inside, he discovers a colorful fish inside him—a part of himself that longs to sparkle, sing, and dance. As Finn embarks on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and adventure, he finds the courage to be himself! Fun for all ages!\n\nPB&J Cafe: A Dinner Theater for Kids! At the PB&J Cafe, young theatergoers will enjoy a meal during the performance and leave with autographs from their favorite characters.\n\n\nSee Constellation’s website for more information, including a detailed performance schedule.

    "description": "In honor of its 250th Anniversary, John Schilb, Culbertson Chair and Professor Emeritus of English, will analyze Abraham Lincoln’s rhetoric regarding the Declaration of Independence. Many of Lincoln's opponents (e.g., Stephen Douglas and Jefferson Davis) either ridiculed the Declaration's claim that \"all men are created equal\" or believed that it applied just to whites. Lincoln maintained that \"all\" really did mean everyone. Only gradually, however, was he willing to consider Black people his social peers. Statements that he made during his debates with Douglas reflect this complex attitude. And even the Gettysburg Address does not assume that the Declaration's message has a future. Indeed, that speech called the Declaration's claim about equality a \"proposition\" to be tested. That is, Lincoln saw American democracy as something that might not endure. Its fate still seems in question, so his take on the Declaration remains timely.",

    "description": "Constellation Stage & Screen presents “Finn: A New Musical- At the PB&J Cafe,” on stage May 1-17 at the Waldron Auditorium.\n\nFrom the creator of Doc McStuffins and Vampirina, Finn is a heartwarming musical adventure about a young shark on the brink of growing up. As he prepares to join the fearsome Shark Guard, Finn can’t shake the feeling that he’s different from the other sharks. Deep inside, he discovers a colorful fish inside him—a part of himself that longs to sparkle, sing, and dance. As Finn embarks on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and adventure, he finds the courage to be himself! Fun for all ages!\n\nPB&J Cafe: A Dinner Theater for Kids! At the PB&J Cafe, young theatergoers will enjoy a meal during the performance and leave with autographs from their favorite characters.\n\n\nSee Constellation’s website for more information, including a detailed performance schedule.

    "description": "Every Wednesday at 8PM is Comedy Attic Open Mic Night. Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!",
