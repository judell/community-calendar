    "description": "Drawing on over 45 years of training, teaching, and competing, Mary Hoedeman has created a clear, approachable program designed to help dancers feel confident, comfortable, and successful on the social dance floor.\n\nNight Club is a sophisticated and elegant way to slow dance — emphasizing balance, connection, musicality, and ease rather than memorized patterns or performance.\n\nIn this workshop, Mary breaks Night Club down to its essentials, identifying only the relevant steps and principles needed to accomplish the movement. From there, dancers are guided through a simple structure repeated 21 times — until the dance smiles back.\n\nThis method allows the body to learn naturally through repetition, resulting in:\n\n  * Smooth, relaxed movement\n  * Increased confidence and balance\n  * Clear lead-and-follow connection\n  * A deeper sense of musical timing\n\nThis workshop is appropriate for:\n\n  * New dancers\n  * Experienced social dancers\n  * Anyone wanting a graceful, confident slow dance they can use immediately\n\nNo partner is required. Roles rotate frequently, and the environment is welcoming, supportive, and grounded in real social dancing.\n\nThis is not about performance or perfection — it’s about learning to feel good while dancing.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "From Executive Producers Richard Gere and Oren Moverman.\nWISDOM OF HAPPINESS shows us a timeless truth: happiness is still possible, even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty.\n\nThis powerful message of hope is delivered as a personal audience with one of the greatest living thinkers, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Tenzin Gyatso, known to billions around the world as the Dalai Lama.\n\nSpeaking as a member of our single global community, he shares practical wisdom for finding peace, compassion, and hope in the midst of chaos. With disarming clarity and deep humanity, he invites us to imagine—and help create—a world where compassion is activated as our strongest force for change, and happiness is within reach for everyone.\n\nIn WISDOM OF HAPPINESS, the Dalai Lama speaks directly to viewers, sharing his Tibetan wisdom, underscoring the oneness of humanity, and offering a message of hope and serenity in troubled times. He reflects on how each of us can overcome negative emotions and strengthen positive ones like love and compassion, opening the path to happier, more meaningful lives while contributing to a healthier and more harmonious future. He also emphasizes that the feminine principle of kindness and connection is urgently needed, even suggesting the next Dalai Lama may be female.\n\nThe film is a grand and immersive cinematic experience. The Dalai Lama guides us by asking how “modern” people can find peace of mind despite the stresses of daily life, the climate crisis, and the anxieties of ongoing wars. That inner calm, he reminds us, enables us to create peace and justice outwardly and to take action together.\n\nOne of the greatest living thinkers, the 14th Dalai Lama is now 90 years old and looks back on a life that has, perhaps unsurprisingly, been the subject of various Hollywood film productions. Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama’s full spiritual name, is one of the most well-known figures of our time. His tenure as the head of Tibetan Buddhists has lasted longer than the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, given that he was enthroned at the age of five.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Guided by a trained art therapist, the open studio welcomes visitors to engage with materials at their own pace while drawing inspiration from the surrounding exhibitions. No art experience is needed; just bring your curiosity and a desire to create, and we'll handle the rest!  Participants are welcome to utilize supplies located in the studio, as well as bring their own supplies/projects to work on.  This group meets on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month, excluding holidays and museum closures. It is open to everyone: students, staff, and the public included!

    "description": "BCT & Bloomington Roots present a special Valentine concert: Over the Rhine ~ INFAMOUS LOVE SONGS ~\n\n“Some years ago, when Johnny Cash’s career was undergoing a resurgence during his creative collaborations with producer, Rick Rubin, someone made an attempt to organize Johnny’s songs into three categories: God, Love and Death. It occurred to me then that maybe those are the only three subjects available to the writer. I have tried to write about all three.\n\nAnd yet, one night over a late night beverage, by way of confession, I admitted to a colleague (a fellow songwriter) that I was embarrassed by the possibility that every song I had ever written was essentially a love song.\n\nWithout missing a beat he responded, Well, maybe, but you don’t just write about falling in love: you write about what happens further down the road.\n\nI was relieved and grateful to receive that perspective, because ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed further down the road. Karin and I have been writing, and making records together as Over the Rhine for 35 years. We’ve been married for 29 of those. Long live musical couples. Johnny and June might be our patron saints, but they are not the only ones. A significant swath of our favorite music over the years has been made by that rare and endangered breed of exotic zoo animal: the musical couple. (The list includes Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Buddy and Julie Miller, Richard and Linda Thompson, The Innocence Mission and others.) But back to further down the road… Poet Christina Rosetti famously wrote the lines: Does the road wind uphill all the way? Yes, to the very end.\n\nFew things in life get easier as the years pass. But from this vantage point, after 35 years of climbing, we can see the broader view. We can see the two songwriters who were stoned on love and words and possibility. We can see the couple who almost called it a day, and yet found their way into — and with — each other. We learned that we tend two separate gardens: the garden of our career in music, and the garden of our life together well apart from the noise of the music industry.\n\nWe know well the thrill of opening shows for Bob Dylan or Lucinda Williams, getting to play at Newport Folk Festival, or in Japan, or New Zealand. And checking those things off our dream list was indeed a thrill. Seeing the world on the backs of the songs. Watching a community coalesce around our music that crossed borders and boundaries.\n\nAnd now it is also the deeper abiding joy of quietly walking two Irish Wolfhounds in the cool of the evening. At home. Being together. The fact that we can still make each other laugh. Sharing a story that’s still being written. We live together on a small farm, grow songs, host concerts in the restored barn, and curate and host Nowhere Else Festival — our very own music and arts festival, the festival that we were always looking for but never quite found until we built it ourselves. Both/and.\n\nWe have written a lifetime of love songs in all shapes and sizes. We were curious as to what an evening devoted entirely to the possibilities of love songs might feel like. And so, come Valentine’s Day, we’re going to go find a few favorite stages, and find out. We hope you’ll join us.”\n\nLinford Detweiler (w/Karin Bergquist close by)\nSeptember 2025, Martinsville, Ohio\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

When a harmonium and a mysterious woman enters his life (Emily Watson), his romantic journey begins, but not without an extortion side quest for the ages—enter Philip Seymour Hoffman in yet another small, but wildly impactful, role. Jon Brion (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Magnolia) helps fuel the narrative with a baroque, futurist score that helps Punch-Drunk Love channel \"the spirit of classic Hollywood musicals and the whimsy of Jacques Tati into an idiosyncratic ode to the delirium of new romance\" (Criterion Collection).

Get out there with spontaneous acts of generosity, compassion, and goodwill for others with the goal of spreading joy and positivity. And then bring your loved ones and family to see this fantastically warm Pixar film, “Up” for $5 each.\n\nCarl Fredricksen, a retired balloon salesman and widower, is part rascal, part dreamer and ready for his last chance at high-flying excitement. Tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets off to South America and the lost world of his childhood dreams in order to fulfill a promise that he made to his late wife. But unbeknownst to curmudgeon Carl, an overeager 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer who has never ventured beyond his backyard is in the wrong place at the wrong time… Carl’s front porch.\n\nThe world’s most unlikely duo reach new heights and meet fantastic friends like Dug, a dog with a special collar that allows him to speak, and Kevin, a rare 13-foot-tall flightless bird. Stuck together in the wilds of the jungle, Carl realizes that sometimes life’s biggest adventures aren’t the ones you set out to have.\n\nReviewers say “Up” is an emotional and imaginative film exploring love, loss, and adventure, and praise its poignant storytelling and opening sequence.\n\nRATED: PG\nFORMAT: DCP\nLENGTH: 1hr 40min\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

To pay her back, Mary has to work at her local New York Public Library branch, as far away a profession from her party-girl lifestyle as she can imagine.

    "description": "Nine-time Grammy nominee Tierney Sutton has received eight nominations for Best Jazz Vocal Album and a ninth for arranging. Known for her impeccable voice and superbly imaginative arrangements, Sutton is heralded for her ability to transform even the most familiar song into a revelation. She is a story-teller. Her 15 recordings as leader have addressed such themes as materialism and the pursuit of happiness and have paid tribute to the music of Bill Evans, Frank Sinatra, and Sting. Her 2013 Joni Mitchell tribute, After Blue, featured NEA Jazz Master Hubert Laws and jazz vocal legend Al Jarreau. Her latest album, Paris Sessions 2, features Serge Merlaud, Kevin Axt, and Hubert Laws. The pandemic found Tierney deepening her collaboration with piano powerhouse Tamir Hendelman. This exciting duo has an album in the works. Since 1993, Sutton has fronted The Tierney Sutton Band, which has featured instrumental virtuosos Christian Jacob, Trey Henry, Kevin Axt, and Ray Brinker. After 29 years together with the same personnel, Tierney has recently opened the band to exciting new members, yet retaining the same creative, united energy that has fueled the last three decades. Director Clint Eastwood called Sutton \"my favorite singer\" and hired her, along with pianist Christian Jacob and the Tierney Sutton Band, to score his 2016 film, Sully. When she is not performing, Tierney is in demand as both a studio producer and vocal coach. She served as vocal producer for famed lyric soprano Natalie Dessay on several albums for Sony Classics, including Pictures of America and Between Yesterday and Tomorrow. Sutton has taught at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music, Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, and Los Angeles College of Music, and currently serves on the faculty of the Centre Des Musiques Didier Lockwood in France. She has given workshops and master classes throughout the world and has taught and mentored some of the finest new generation of singers, including Sara Gazarek and Gretchen Parlato.  Award-winning jazz pianist Tamir Hendelman has performed with the Jeff Hamilton Trio, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, Harry Allen, Teddy Edwards, Warren Vache, Houston Person, Jeff Clayton, Nick Brignola, Phil Upchurch, Rickey Woodard, John Clayton, and Barbara Morrison. He also leads his own trio, and his debut CD Playground features him in this trio setting. Beginning his keyboard studies at age 6 in Tel Aviv, Hendelman moved to the United States at age 12 in 1984, winning Yamaha's national keyboard competition at age 14. Concerts in Japan and the Kennedy Center followed. Hendelman then studied at the Tanglewood Institute and earned a Bachelor of Music Composition degree from Eastman School of Music. He then became the youngest musical director for Lovewell Institute, a national arts education non-profit organization. Since returning to Los Angeles in 1996, Hendelman has been in steady demand as pianist and arranger, touring the United States, Europe, and Asia, and receiving awards from ASCAP and National Foundation For Advancement in the Arts. In 1999 Hendelman was a guest soloist with the Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra. Hendelman joined the Jeff Hamilton Trio in 2000, contributing arrangements, recording and touring Japan, Europe and the United States. In 2001, he became a member of the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra (CHJO). In 2002, he also toured Europe with Tierney Sutton and the Bill Holman Big Band. Hendelman musically directed Julia Migenes's Alter Ego and played/arranged on Roberta Gambarini's Easy to Love. With the CHJO, Hendelman has recorded for John Pizzarelli, Gladys Knight, and Diana Krall. He is the pianist/arranger on Jackie Ryan's You and the Night and the Music and Janis Mann's A Perfect Time. He is also featured on Natalie Cole's Still Unforgettable and Barbara Streisand's upcoming recording. Hendelman's musical travels have taken him from Alaska to New York, and Thailand to Israel. In his own trio, he explores standards, Brazilian music, blues, and his Israeli roots. Hendelman is a Resonance Records artist.\n\nSource: IU Jacobs School of Music",

    "description": "4-5 p.m. Artist Talk (Martin Commons, 2nd floor)5-5:30 p.m. Demo and Q&amp;A (Martin Commons, 2nd floor)  Learn how local fiber artist Althea Crome uses unconventional knitting techniques to create tiny works of art. In dialogue with Mulyana: Vital Ecosystems, a large-scale crochet installation, Crome's talk will explore how fiber art can be both monumental and minuscule, expansive and precise. Over 25 years, Crome's work has evolved from knitting baby booties for her four children to developing her own techniques, tools, and designs for her conceptual micro-knits, including miniature garments for the 2009 stopmotion film Coraline. Read more about her work here (https://www.altheacrome.com).\n\nSource: Eskenazi Museum of Art",

    "description": "Ahmet, a 15-year-old boy from a remote Yuruk village in North Macedonia, finds refuge in music while navigating his father’s expectations, a conservative community, and his first experience with love—a girl whose future is already promised to someone else. Georgi M. Unkovski's debut feature is a delightfully inspiring tale as old as time, told in a romantic and rebellious new way. A devoted shepherd longing for more than green pastures and the bleating of his faithful herd, Ahmet enlists his younger brother Naim to help him capture the attention (and hopefully, affections) of village beauty Aya, who is begrudgingly betrothed to another. Did we mention there's a banging soundtrack and neon pink sheep to move the plot along? Winner of the Sundance World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for Creative Vision.

    "description": "Songwriter Vienna Teng re-emerges this fall with her mashup song pair We’ve Got You – her first new music in over a decade – but her fans have been here the whole time.\n\nThey’ve packed concert venues even in years between releases, crowdfunded an ambitious music video in hours, and joined by the hundreds when she launched her “music x climate action” Patreon in 2022.\n\nThat kind of devotion has poured forth since 2002’s Waking Hour, which landed her on NPR’s Weekend Edition, The Late Show with David Letterman, and the top of Amazon’s music charts. Across four more studio albums that followed – the chamber folk of Warm Strangers, the jazz-inflected Dreaming Through the Noise, the indie epic Inland Territory, the bright electro-pop in Aims – Vienna has paid homage to her genre-bending heroes like Paul Simon and Tori Amos, while carving a path all her own. Together with her captivating live performances and thoughtful online presence, her work has built a loyal following across generations and continents.\n\nVienna’s new mini-EP We’ve Got You reflects the complexity of her life over the past decade: climate change work, community building, parenthood. Two songs, each titled “We’ve Got You,” act like fraternal twins: one an indie-pop tribute to inspiring leaders, the other a chamber-folk paean to unsung caregivers. Played simultaneously, they reveal a new intricate whole: a mashup by design, and a love letter to social movements.\n\nAppropriately, Vienna now also hosts climate action workshops on tour and online, which participants have described as “rocket fuel” and “the perfect antidote to despair.”\n\nIt’s an exciting new chapter in the ever-evolving love story between an artist and her audience.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "Enjoy this performance from almost anywhere in the world viaLIVE@jacobs!About the DirectorNatalie Boeyink, bassist and educator, serves as associate professor of music jazz studies at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. After earning her doctorate in music education at the Jacobs School in 2015, Boeyink spent eight years as a jazz lecturer and senior lecturer in the University of North Carolina system. She earned an M.M. in Jazz Performance at the University of Louisville and a B.M. in Jazz Studies at Jacobs. Her interest in the educational experiences and careers of jazzwomen has launched a series of research projects, conference presentations and publications, including her dissertation, \"An Analysis and Description of Female Jazz Instrumentalists.\" An advocate for jazzwomen, Boeyink served as chair of the Jazz Education Network's Women in Jazz Committee and worked to reestablish the Sisters in Jazz Collegiate Combo Competition. Batuquê Trio is Boeyink's seasoned collaboration with drummer Andy Smith and pianist Jamaal Baptiste. Focusing on contemporary Brazilian, Afro-Cuban, and Caribbean jazz, the trio frequently appears at jazz festivals as performers and clinicians. Their first CD, Transparency, was released in 2015. A second album is forthcoming in 2024. Some of Boeyink's notable performances include appearances with Tammy McCann, Jamie Baum, Ingrid Jensen, Terri Lyne Carrington, Christine Jensen, Leni Stern, Jovino Santos Neto, Joe Piscopo, David \"Fathead\" Newman, Jon Hendricks, Jeff Coffin, David Liebman, and Lorraine Feather.

Guided by a trained art therapist, the open studio welcomes visitors to engage with materials at their own pace while drawing inspiration from the surrounding exhibitions. No art experience is needed; just bring your curiosity and a desire to create, and we'll handle the rest!  Participants are welcome to utilize supplies located in the studio, as well as bring their own supplies/projects to work on.  This group meets on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month, excluding holidays and museum closures. It is open to everyone: students, staff, and the public included! The group will meet in the Roehm Family Art-making Studio, located inside the Simpson Center for Education on the 2nd floor of the Eskenazi Museum of Art.\n\nSource: Eskenazi Museum of Art",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "Q&A with Filmaker Michael Husain and former Pacers Darnell “Dr. Dunk” HIllman and Dave Robisch after the film!\n\n\nAn incredible story of the ABA – a flamboyant rival league to the NBA – and its players. They created much of what the billion dollar NBA is today–the 3-point shot, slam dunk contest, fashion and culture innovators–but then are forgotten in a business deal gone bad.\n\nThe Waiting Game is a powerful documentary that reveals an incredible battle between the NBA and a tiny not-for-profit working to gain full recognition for the men of the ABA. It’s a fight for benefits the players of the ABA felt were promised, but never delivered. While following an investigation of the legal trail of the ABA-NBA merger, key impact journalism and the advocacy for justice, the film reveals the lines that can stand between raw corporate interest and basic human dignity.\n\n“I’m an ABA guy. I got my start there. This is a very important film with a genuine hero at the center.” Bob Costas\n\n“This is the REAL story of the guys I played with and the league that was so important to all of us. It made me cry and it made me proud. I want EVERYONE to see this.” “Dr Dunk” Darnell Hillman, 3-time ABA Champion, Winner of first NBA Slam Dunk Contest\n\n“Here’s me explicitly asking you to please watch Michael Husain’s documentary as soon as possible and recommend it to your nearest NBA fanatic so that they can raise their voice for the legends associated with the ABA.” Pramit Chatterjee, Rotten Tomato Reviewer\n\nRATING: N/A\nLENGTH: 1hr 30min\nFORMAT: DCP\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Contestants vie for the most coveted prize in all of public radio: a custom-recorded greeting by any of our cast members for their voicemail.  &#160;  Every week, Wait, Wait…. Don't Tell Me! records in front of a live audience, then carefully edits out all the raunchy, inappropriate, shocking, and hilarious stuff so we can broadcast something that doesn't get NPR in trouble… well, more trouble. The only way you can find out what our panelists and guests really think about the news is to come see for yourself. And please—don't tell NPR. Also, we're all much more attractive than we sound.\n\nSource: IU Auditorium",

The film did not draw much attention in the States upon initial release, but it has since grown a reputation as a distinctly poetic piece of horror cinema. When it was released in the United States, Eyes Without a Face was re-cut, dubbed into English, and retitled as The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus.

    "description": "“THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE CELTIC REALM” – The Boston Globe\n\n“A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN” and “THE BEST TRADITIONAL IRISH BAND” – Dolly Parton on her collaboration with Altan on two of her albums Heartsongs (1994) and Little Sparrow (2001)\n\nThe spirit and sound of Altan comes from the deep and rich musical tradition of their native Co. Donegal. On one of his many visits to the Donegal Gaeltacht of Gaoth Dobhair, Belfast born flute player Frankie Kennedy met fiddler and singer Mairead Ní Mhaonaigh, sparking off a deep musical connection, marriage in 1981, and a journey that took them all over the world. Their vision was to bring the unique repertoire of Donegal music to the world and that mission is still as strong as ever.\n\nIn the mid 80s, Mairead and Frankie recruited bouzouki player Ciaran Curran from Fermanagh, whose intricate counterpoint is at the center of the Altan sound, and guitarist Mark Kelly from Dublin, whose mastery of a wide palette of guitar styles and harmonic vocabulary add a breadth and depth of color. As a band, Altan played their first concert on June 1st 1985, in St. John’s Church in Listowel, Co. Kerry at the famous Listowel Writers Week.\n\nTheir first album, simply titled Altan was released in 1987 and quickly followed by Horse with A Heart, which saw the inclusion of Paul O’Saughnessy on fiddle. Paul had joined the band on its first US tours, lending his stunning virtuosity and in-depth knowledge of the Donegal style. He performed on the subsequent three albums. In 1992, the album Harvest Storm brought with it Dáithí Sproule on guitar, himself one of the pioneers of guitar in Irish traditional and folk music, having played with the wonderful Skara Brae with the O’Domhnaill family and Buncrana native Ciaran Tourish who excelled in fiery counterpoint fiddle.\n\nOne of the band’s finest hours came with the release of Island Angel in 1993, which was recognized by Billboard World Music Charts as the second biggest selling world music album globally in 1994 and in the same year, Altan performed for Bill Clinton at the White House. The band would play for US Presidents over the course of their career as well as accompanying Irish Presidents on their state visits. Shortly after the release of this album, the legendary accordionist Dermot Byrne joined the band.\n\nSadly, on September 19th,1994, the band and wider world of music was dealt a devastating blow with the death of founding member Frankie Kennedy. His vision, artistry and sense of fun is still at the heart of Altan and his legacy is carried and celebrated in every note. A record deal with Virgin Records followed in 1996, which catapulted the band on an extensive touring schedule over the subsequent decade. This period saw them working with many of the great American performers such as Dolly Parton, recording on her album Heartsongs (1994) and its follow up, Little Sparrow 2001; she returned the favor on the band’s record The Blue Idol in 2002 by dieting with Mairéad on the song The Pretty Young Girl. The band have traveled with Ireland’s President Mary MacAleese and President Michael D. Higgins on state visits abroad to Japan, North Korea and Italy. President Higgins invited them to join him in his residence, Aras an Uachtaraá in in 2018 to celebrate their 30 years as a band. The Donegal County Council held a civic reception in their offices to mark the occasion in May 2018. In 2006 the Irish Government also honored Altan by putting them on an official postal stamp to celebrate their contribution to the Irish culture one of the highest honors to be bestowed on an Irish citizen.\n\nMartin Tourish a past TG4 Young Musician of the Year, took the accordion seat in late 2013 and the band recorded their album The Widening Gyre in Nashville with many of the great Bluegrass and American performers, such as Mary Chapin Carpenter, Jerry Douglas and Alison Brown. This album explored the connections between Irish and Bluegrass music, a particularly special moment of which was performing at The Grand Ole Opry with Ricky Skaggs in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, the band released their first book, Altan: The Tunes, based on a collection of 222 melodies that they collected recorded over their 30 year history. Martin Tourish transcribed the dance music and meticulously interviewed all the band members for additional stories and background information. Containing a detailed commentary on each of the tunes, it is the only collection of Donegal music currently in print.\n\nMairead Ní Mhaonaigh was awarded Donegal Person of the Year in 2008 and the coveted TG4 Gradaim Ceoil (Music Award) 2017, for her musicianship and singing. The highest accolade which a traditional musician can receive in Ireland.\n\nIn celebration of the band’s latest album, The Gap of Dreams, the band has brought their music all over Europe and Ireland, the US and Canada, Japan, Australia and even North Africa. The latest album celebrates the roots of their music in Donegal folklore. It was recorded in the Attica Studios in the mountains of Donegal which contributed to a wonderful atmosphere which permeated throughout the recording. The title refers to that ‘gap’ or ‘door’ between this and the ‘other world.’ The older fiddlers , whom they got their music from, always associated with the “other world” as the source for their music and inspiration. They would describe poetically about encountering the fairy folk or listening to tunes on the wind or on the shore listening to the sound of the waves.\n\nIn creativity the ‘Gap of Dreams” is never shut. http://www.altan.ie/\n\nwww.facebook.com/altanofficial https://www.facebook.com/altanofficial\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "Enjoy this performance from almost anywhere in the world viaLIVE@jacobs!About the DirectorsWayne Wallace is professor of practice in jazz studies and jazz trombone at the IU Jacobs School of Music. A seven-time Grammy nominee, he is one of the most respected exponents of African American Latin music in the world today. Wallace is known for his use of traditional forms and styles in combination with contemporary music and has earned wide critical acclaim, including placement in both the trombone and producer categories of the DownBeat Critics Poll. An accomplished arranger, educator, and composer with compositions for film and television, he has received grants from the Creative Work Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Lila Wallace Foundation, and the San Francisco Arts Commission. Wallace has performed, recorded, and studied with many acknowledged masters of the Afro-Latin and jazz idioms, such as Aretha Franklin, Bobby Hutcherson, Earth Wind and Fire, Pete Escovedo, Santana, and many more. This experience has provided a solid foundation for Wallace's current explorations of the intersections of a wealth of cultural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco, Wallace was exposed to blues, country and western, R&amp;B, jazz, and Afro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area shaped his career. His studies of Afro-Latin music and jazz include trips to Cuba, New York City, and Puerto Rico. Widely respected as a teacher and historian, Wallace has taught at San Jos State University, Stanford University, and the Jazzschool in Berkeley. He has conducted lectures, workshops, and clinics in the Americas and Europe since 1983. Head of the critically acclaimed Patois Records, Wallace has created a unique record label with a passionate mission of developing and chronicling the multilingual styles of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene. Under his direction the label has released 13 recordings to critical acclaim, including recordings by Wallace, Marc and Paul van Wageningen, and vocalists Kat Parra, Alexa Weber-Morales, and Kristina. He is an endorser of Conn-Selmer trombones.Andy Miller is lecturer in music in percussion at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, with an emphasis in Latin jazz and Afro-Latin percussion music. An engaging performer and passionate educator, he navigates the diverse world of percussion with technical and musical precision across a broad range of artistic practices. Fostering a deep interest in the percussion music of the African diaspora, Miller has studied with master percussionists in the United States and internationally. A Fulbright grant recipient, Miller studied Afro-Colombian currulao, cumbia, and bullerengue in Colombia with La Wey Segura, Francis Lara, and Emilsen Pacheco, later returning on a Presser Graduate Music Award to study joropo music with Fernando Torres Ramirez. Miller conducted field research in Brazil with Jorge Alabê for his doctoral project, \"The Language of Drumming in Afro-Brazilian Candomblé Ketu.\" His study of bomba percussion, song, and dance took him to Puerto Rico to study with Beto Torrens, Marién Torres, Rafa Maya, and Hector \"Coco\" Baréz. He studied Guinean mande drumming with Bolokada Conde and Afro-Cuban folkloric and popular percussion with Michael Spiro. Miller also champions percussion art music by Latin American composers, including a performance of Ricardo Lorenz's Venezuelan maracas concerto Pataruco with the Jacobs School's University Orchestra. Commissions include Maria José by Luis Fernando Sanchez Gooding, Silent Surface by Rafael Llanos, and Monologue IV: Bilingüismo by José Martinez. His commitment to new music has led to residencies with the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival and the Atlantic Music Festival Contemporary Ensemble. His collaborations with choreographers as a composer/performer have premiered in New York City, throughout the Midwest, and internationally. Miller served as music director of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Dance Department (2017-24), accompanying classes in styles including modern, ballet, West African, and Afro-Latin dance. He previously taught percussion at the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music, Olivet Nazarene University, and Bembé Drum and Dance. Miller earned degrees from IU (D.M.), the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (M.M.), and Wright State University (B.M.).

    "description": "Performances of \"Suramaya\" at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  This 30-minute shadow puppet performance by Dr. Jennifer Goodlander tells the tale of a king who sends his servants into the forest to collect supplies for a big party. The king of the forest, Suramaya, does not like his plan. Experience a dynamic story with an environmental message, told with beautiful animal puppets. Appropriate for all ages.About Dr. Jennifer Goodlander  Jennifer Goodlander is an Associate Professor in the Dept. of Theatre, Drama, and Contemporary Dance and Director of the Southeast Asian and ASEAN Studies Center. Jennifer has published numerous articles and two books: Women in the Shadows: Gender, Puppets, and the Power of Tradition in Bali (Ohio University Press, 2016) and Puppets and Cities: Articulating Identities in Southeast Asia (Bloomsbury Methuen Drama, 2018). Jennifer remains active as a director and has performed Balinese wayang kulit, or shadow puppetry, at international festivals and around the United States.Connections to Mulyana: Vital Ecosystems (https://artmuseum.indiana.edu/exhibitions/upcoming/_feature-exhibitions/2026-02-07-mulyana-vital-ecosystems.html)  Mulyana's community-engaged artmaking practice, performances, and immersive installations reinvent Indonesia's enduring tradition of shadow puppetry (wayang kulit). Wayang combines engaging storytelling, music, spirituality, and a range of different characters. Alluding to this theatrical apparatus, Mulyana invents his own distinct octopus-monster characters (Mogus) to populate his fantastical textile ecosystems. His dramatic use of light and shadow further evokes the atmospheric quality of shadow puppet performances. Consistent with this tradition, Mulyana: Vital Ecosystems fosters community gathering and conveys a powerful message about social wellbeing.Know Before You Go:  This event is part of the First Thursdays festivals showcase (https://artsandhumanities.indiana.edu/council-programs/first-thursdays/index.html).

    "description": "With panel discussions, presentations, workshops, and concerts, Harmony and Power will explore how cultural diplomacy shapes power and global connections. Participants include renowned scholars, practitioners, performers, and students from a variety of disciplines.  &#160;SCHEDULE OF EVENTS:9:00-11:30 │Historical Panel: \"Music and Cold-War Diplomacy\"  Kevin Bartig, \"Behind the Iron Curtain Before the Iron Curtain: Western Musicians in the Soviet Union During the Interwar Period\"In this presentation, I reconstruct the largely forgotten activities of foreign musicians and critics in Soviet Russia during the interwar period. Through concert tours and residencies, these visitors moved information and ideas across borders, shaped Soviet musical self-identity, and effected a form of cultural exchange that prefigures—and complicates conventional narratives of—later Cold War musical exchange with the Soviet Union.  Bess Liu, \"'Big Brother is Listening!' Music, Friendship, and the Sino-Soviet Relations during the Korean War (1950-1953)\"This project studies the negotiated musicianship as represented by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association (SSFA) in Dalian, China, during the Korean War (1950-1953). Musical diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union, at this critical historical moment, entails contrasting stories between genuine inter-personal friendship and intricate interstate politics within the Communist world.  Grace Pechianu, \"Diplomacy in the Ether: Radio Free Europe and Romanian Exiles as Jazz Ambassadors\"The defected jazz pianist Eugen Ciceu credited jazz programs from Voice of America, Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Europe for shaping his musicianship in socialist Romania. This talk follows Ciceu's trajectory as a consumer-turned-contributor of American counterpropaganda on his Radio Free Europe interview and performance from 1964 while assessing radio's role in enabling exiles to serve as cultural diplomats.  Lynn Hooker, \"State Folk Ensembles: Shock Troops of the Cultural Cold War or Cash Cow?\"Across the East Bloc and elsewhere, staged folkdance groups were some of the most prominent representatives of the culture of socialist states. As well as being cultural diplomats, they earned important income from Western audiences. Press coverage and oral histories from the Hungarian League of Young Communists' Rajkó Ensemble reveal the complexities of this role.  Danielle Lussier-Fosler, \"The Market Effects of Propaganda: Government Money and the 'New Music' Boom\"When the US government used music as propaganda, the effects of those programs were noticeable at home as well as abroad. Despite claims that the government did not subsidize the arts, government funding for music propaganda established strong incentives for the creation, publication, and recording of contemporary concert music.11:45-12:45 │ \"Conversations with Experts: Preserving Cultural Heritage with UNESCO Programs\"  Julius Heinicke and Iryna Voloshyna2:00-3:00 │ \"Conversations with Experts: Building Peace through Business Initiatives\"  Timothy Fort and John Katsos4:30-5:30 │ \"Conversations with Experts: Connecting Culture and Policy with U.S. State Department\"  Mark Katz and Paul Kruchoski  &#160;PARTICIPANT BIOSKevin Bartig is Professor of Musicology at Michigan State University.

    "description": "The Silkroad Ensemble's latest flagship program with Artistic Director Rhiannon Giddens is Sanctuary: The Power of Resonance and Ritual. In this program, Giddens and the ensemble explore how to experience music to better understand the world, find comfort, process loss in a changing environment, and rebuild community based on humanity. Historically, when people have found themselves in a time of conflict or stress, they have always turned to music.  &#160;  The idea of trance, something that can bring a deep peace that is hard to find in modern society, is profoundly tied to the communal music-making traditions found in many different cultures, from Morocco to India to Ireland, and is a way to build a stronger human connection amidst all the noise. In Sanctuary: The Power of Resonance and Ritual, the musicians will delve deeply into one another's music and traditions, such as Sicilian tarantella with Mauro Durante and Francesco Turrisi, Moroccan gnawa with Mehdi Nassouli, Indian classical music with Sandeep Das, American old-time with Giddens on banjo, and more, and invite audiences to join them as partners and participants in the performance, instead of solely as passive bystanders.\n\nSource: IU Auditorium",

If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

He is professor of orchestral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as well as artistic partner with the Northwest Sinfonietta, one of the northwest United States' most vibrantly creative ensembles. Artistic director of the St. Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic for two decades, his work with the orchestra was noted for its breadth and innovation. His programming has earned three ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming and two Vytautas Marijošius Memorial Awards. A champion of contemporary music, Meyer imagines the orchestra experience as a forum for story, emotion, and civic dialogue. His projects have paired symphonic works with multimedia visionaries and diverse cultural collaborators. His recordings span repertoire from baroque to the present; his most recent, Illuminations: Music of Narong Prangcharoen, was released by Albany Records in 2023. Recent highlights include a multimedia Rite of Spring and Petrushka with the Thailand Philharmonic; Carlos Simon's Graffiti with renowned graffiti artists; a theatrical symphonic concert developed in collaboration with Daniel Bernard Roumain and Marc Bamuthi Joseph; Laura Kaminsky's Piano Concerto with Ursula Oppens (Cedille Records); a semistaged production of Nkeiru Okoye's Invitation to a Die-In; and multiple collaborations with the American Composers Orchestra's EarShot program. Recent and upcoming engagements include the City Chamber Orchestra of Hong Kong, Los Angeles Ballet, Xalapa Symphony, Orquesta Juvenil Universitaria Eduardo Mata, American Composers Orchestra, Texas Festival Orchestra at Round Top, and returns to the Grossman Ensemble, Sichuan Symphony, and Thailand Philharmonic. Passionate about working with young musicians and music education, Meyer is an active adjudicator, guest clinician, and master class teacher. Prior to his appointment at the Jacobs School, he led acclaimed orchestral programs at Arizona State University and Ithaca College. He has given master classes throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Meyer holds degrees in piano and composition and earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in Piano Performance with Gilbert Kalish at Stony Brook University.\n\nSource: IU Jacobs School of Music",

JJ Otero (Navajo/Hopi) brings a unique perspective to contemporary Native art.

Since 2018, his work has been featured at prominent Native art markets, including the Heard Museum Art Market, SEEDS Art Market, and the Santa Fe Indian Market.  Guided by the belief that\"This moment is perfect and there's nothing lacking,\"JJ's approach to texture, stamping, and form demonstrates both technical rigor and an evolving artistic voice.All of these activities are free and open to the public.

    "description": "In this workshop, we begin by looking closely at artwork—asking what we see, think, feel, and wonder. Together, we'll explore the artist's possible message and its social meaning, then turn those reflections into our own creative responses.  Whether you're a writer or simply curious to try something new, you'll find inspiration here and a welcoming community to share the journey.  About the Exhibition  Step into the world of acclaimed photographer Rania Matar (b. 1964, Lebanon), whose striking portraits document young women persisting in uncertain times. Matar's lens highlights women's creativity, strength, dignity, and resilience—offering a powerful counter-narrative to the challenges of her country and region.

If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

He most recently wrote, produced, and starred in the indie comedy Let’s Start a Cult. His latest stand-up special, Fat Rascal, is streaming on Netflix, following his debut special Live at the Lodge Room, which hit one million views in its first four days and has since surpassed seven million.\n\nOne of the most in-demand touring comedians today, Halkias is currently on The Dreamboat Tour. His podcast Stavvy’s World debuted at #3 on the iTunes Comedy Charts, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers in its first year. He will soon appear in Yorgos Lanthimos’ Bugonia, premiering at the Venice Film Festival, and in A24’s Tony, a film about Anthony Bourdain. He also stars in the Netflix comedy series Tires, bringing his quick wit and offbeat charm to television audiences.\n\nA founding member and former co-host of the hit podcast Cum Town (2016–2022), Halkias has also been featured in Steven Soderbergh’s sci-fi series Command Z. Outside of comedy, he made his runway debut at KidSuper’s Paris Fashion Week show in 2023, earning Vogue’s nod as “the plus-est of plus-size models.” His ultimate dream? Get just famous enough to buy his mother a nice home—then retire from show business to open a surf-and-turf restaurant in East Baltimore.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "Five Friends Master Class Series – Honoring Zachary NovakThe Five Friends Master Class Series honoring the lives of five talented Jacobs School of Music students—Chris Carducci, Garth Eppley, Georgina Joshi, Zachary Novak, and Robert Samels—was established in 2012 with a gift of $1 million from the Georgina Joshi Foundation, Inc. This annual series of lectures, master classes, and residencies by a number of the world's leading musicians and teachers focuses on areas of interest most relevant to the lives of the five friends—voice performance, choral conducting, early music, music theory, composition, and opera. The Georgina Joshi Foundation was established in 2007 as the vision of Georgina Joshi's mother, Louise Addicott-Joshi, to provide educational and career development opportunities for young musicians and to encourage and support public performance of music. The gift to the school establishes a permanent way for the world to learn about each of the five friends, their musical talents and passions, and to encourage the development of similar talents and passions in current and future music students. The establishment of this endowment by the families is administered by the IU Foundation.Zachary Novak showed his enthusiasm for music at a young age, playing piano and organ, singing, and conducting. He put his talents to use as a musician for several churches throughout high school and college. Zachary was known for his sharp intellect, exceptional work ethic, and dazzling smile. He had a deep passion for music which he expressed through his conducting and vibrant tenor voice. His thirst for knowledge and a compelling desire for excellence were clearly evident by the way Zachary lived his life. He graduated summa cum laude from Anderson University (AU) in 2004, with honors in music. In 2003, Zachary received the AU music department's Voice Performance Award and the Theodore Presser Award. He also won the senior men's category at the State National Association of Teacher's Singing Award, along with many other accolades. After graduating from AU, Zachary performed professionally as the featured soloist for the Anderson Symphony Orchestra, the Bach Chorale Singers in Lafayette, Indiana, the Carmel Bach Festival in California, as well as other various venues. He went on to earn a Master of Music in Choral Conducting with a minor in Voice from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. Late Thursday night April 20, 2006, Zachary, along with four other IU students, died in a plane crash on their way back to Bloomington from a Bach chorale rehearsal in Lafayette, Indiana. Those friends were Garth Epply (M.M. in Voice Performance at IU), born February 7, 1981, who also attended AU with Zachary, Chris Carducci (M.M. in Voice Performance at IU) born April 18, 1978, Georgina Joshi (M.M. in Voice Performance at IU), born October 21, 1981, and Robert Samels (D.M. in Choral Conducting at IU), born June 2, 1981. All five musicians were known for their passion for life and music. All are deeply missed, but their memory and music live on.\n\nSource: IU Jacobs School of Music",

Come learn how Romanian exiles undermined political and cultural isolationism while advocating for individual agency and creativity within a democratic, free market society.  Grace Pechianu is a doctoral candidate in musicology at Indiana University, Bloomington. Her research considers networks of Romanian exiles and defected musicians, their role as contributors to Radio Free Europe, and role in facilitating communication with Romanians behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nSource: IU Jacobs School of Music",

    "description": "About the DirectorsWayne Wallace is professor of practice in jazz studies and jazz trombone at the IU Jacobs School of Music. A seven-time Grammy nominee, he is one of the most respected exponents of African American Latin music in the world today. Wallace is known for his use of traditional forms and styles in combination with contemporary music and has earned wide critical acclaim, including placement in both the trombone and producer categories of the DownBeat Critics Poll. An accomplished arranger, educator, and composer with compositions for film and television, he has received grants from the Creative Work Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Lila Wallace Foundation, and the San Francisco Arts Commission. Wallace has performed, recorded, and studied with many acknowledged masters of the Afro-Latin and jazz idioms, such as Aretha Franklin, Bobby Hutcherson, Earth Wind and Fire, Pete Escovedo, Santana, and many more. This experience has provided a solid foundation for Wallace's current explorations of the intersections of a wealth of cultural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco, Wallace was exposed to blues, country and western, R&amp;B, jazz, and Afro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area shaped his career. His studies of Afro-Latin music and jazz include trips to Cuba, New York City, and Puerto Rico. Widely respected as a teacher and historian, Wallace has taught at San José State University, Stanford University, and the Jazzschool in Berkeley. He has conducted lectures, workshops, and clinics in the Americas and Europe since 1983. Head of the critically acclaimed Patois Records, Wallace has created a unique record label with a passionate mission of developing and chronicling the multilingual styles of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene. Under his direction the label has released 13 recordings to critical acclaim, including recordings by Wallace, Marc and Paul van Wageningen, and vocalists Kat Parra, Alexa Weber-Morales, and Kristina. He is an endorser of Conn-Selmer trombones.Andy Miller is lecturer in music in percussion at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, with an emphasis in Latin jazz and Afro-Latin percussion music. An engaging performer and passionate educator, he navigates the diverse world of percussion with technical and musical precision across a broad range of artistic practices. Fostering a deep interest in the percussion music of the African diaspora, Miller has studied with master percussionists in the United States and internationally. A Fulbright grant recipient, Miller studied Afro-Colombian currulao, cumbia, and bullerengue in Colombia with La Wey Segura, Francis Lara, and Emilsen Pacheco, later returning on a Presser Graduate Music Award to study joropo music with Fernando Torres Ramirez. Miller conducted field research in Brazil with Jorge Alabê for his doctoral project, \"The Language of Drumming in Afro-Brazilian Candomblé Ketu.\" His study of bomba percussion, song, and dance took him to Puerto Rico to study with Beto Torrens, Marién Torres, Rafa Maya, and Hector \"Coco\" Baréz. He studied Guinean mande drumming with Bolokada Conde and Afro-Cuban folkloric and popular percussion with Michael Spiro. Miller also champions percussion art music by Latin American composers, including a performance of Ricardo Lorenz's Venezuelan maracas concerto Pataruco with the Jacobs School's University Orchestra. Commissions include Maria José by Luis Fernando Sanchez Gooding, Silent Surface by Rafael Llanos, and Monologue IV: Bilingüismo by José Martinez. His commitment to new music has led to residencies with the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival and the Atlantic Music Festival Contemporary Ensemble. His collaborations with choreographers as a composer/performer have premiered in New York City, throughout the Midwest, and internationally. Miller served as music director of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Dance Department (2017-24), accompanying classes in styles including modern, ballet, West African, and Afro-Latin dance. He previously taught percussion at the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music, Olivet Nazarene University, and Bembé Drum and Dance. Miller earned degrees from IU (D.M.), the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (M.M.), and Wright State University (B.M.).\n\nSource: IU Jacobs School of Music",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

He is professor of orchestral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as well as artistic partner with the Northwest Sinfonietta, one of the northwest United States' most vibrantly creative ensembles. Artistic director of the St. Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic for two decades, his work with the orchestra was noted for its breadth and innovation. His programming has earned three ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming and two Vytautas Marijošius Memorial Awards. A champion of contemporary music, Meyer imagines the orchestra experience as a forum for story, emotion, and civic dialogue. His projects have paired symphonic works with multimedia visionaries and diverse cultural collaborators. His recordings span repertoire from baroque to the present; his most recent, Illuminations: Music of Narong Prangcharoen, was released by Albany Records in 2023. Recent highlights include a multimedia Rite of Spring and Petrushka with the Thailand Philharmonic; Carlos Simon's Graffiti with renowned graffiti artists; a theatrical symphonic concert developed in collaboration with Daniel Bernard Roumain and Marc Bamuthi Joseph; Laura Kaminsky's Piano Concerto with Ursula Oppens (Cedille Records); a semistaged production of Nkeiru Okoye's Invitation to a Die-In; and multiple collaborations with the American Composers Orchestra's EarShot program. Recent and upcoming engagements include the City Chamber Orchestra of Hong Kong, Los Angeles Ballet, Xalapa Symphony, Orquesta Juvenil Universitaria Eduardo Mata, American Composers Orchestra, Texas Festival Orchestra at Round Top, and returns to the Grossman Ensemble, Sichuan Symphony, and Thailand Philharmonic. Passionate about working with young musicians and music education, Meyer is an active adjudicator, guest clinician, and master class teacher. Prior to his appointment at the Jacobs School, he led acclaimed orchestral programs at Arizona State University and Ithaca College. He has given master classes throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Meyer holds degrees in piano and composition and earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in Piano Performance with Gilbert Kalish at Stony Brook University.Tichina Vaughn is associate professor of music in voice at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. A Grammy Award-winning American mezzo-soprano, celebrated for her \"superb, rich singing\" and serious \"theatrical presence,\" Vaughn began her international operatic career as a member of the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Program. Recent successes have included her debut at the Welsh National Opera as Zia Principessa and Zita (Il Trittico), her Royal Opera House Covent Garden debut as the Witch (Hansel and Gretel), Azucena (Il Trovatore) for Piedmont Opera, as well as returning to the Metropolitan Opera as the Hostess of the Inn (Boris Gudonow), and roles in Dialogues de Carmélites, Elektra, and Porgy and Bess.

A pulpy adventure inspired by the films of John Hughes and Rob Reiner, six teenagers set out on a cross-country journey through the Midwest to find their missing friend. As the miles pass, old tensions from the turbulent transition between high school and college resurface. Somewhere in between growing up and settling down, a backdrop of summer crickets, endless blue skies, and open roads, they confront their memories and missteps that shaped their drifting friendships.\n\n\nThis film is family friendly. (Includes depictions of alcohol consumption.)\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

The dramatic 250-foot long mural, which originally wrapped around the entire exhibition hall at the World's Fair, depicts the social, economic, and cultural history of Indiana from mound building to the 1930s. After several years of storage following the fair, the panels were given to Indiana University in 1938, where they were installed in three locations on the Bloomington campus.&#160;About Your Guide:  Jim Davis is a Senior Lecturer in the Kelley School of Business, in the department of Management and Entrepreneurship.

This program takes place every Second Sunday of the month, excluding holidays and museum closures. Each month features new artworks and materials, so there's always something fresh to explore and create!

Bloomington has one of the best local comedy scenes in the country, and it all starts with our open mic night!\n\nEach comedian is asked to do no more than five minutes of completely original material. While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable. So if you plan on signing up, be sure to invite as many friends as you can. Good luck!\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

While we do not care about foul language in your set, we do not allow racist, homophobic, transphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist, homophobic, transphobic or a rape joke, it probably is.\n\nComedians that wish to participate are asked to e-mail comedyattic@gmail.com mailto:comedyattic@gmail.com . Newcomers and any participants who are not paid professionals will be required to bring audience members to see them. This is non-negotiable.

    "description": "I’m just a Mississippi boy with a loud mouth and a big heart. I grew up believing in hard work, good friends, and telling it like it is, and I never really grew out of that. Most people know me from my comedy, where I’ve built a career on being unapologetically myself. Whether I’m on stage for the Not-So-Rich-And-Famous Tour, raising hell on social media, or telling stories that hit a little too close to home, I try to keep it real and keep people laughing.\n\nBut I’m more than just a comic. I run Triple B Outdoors, where I get to share my love for hunting, fishing, and the outdoors with folks who live for the same things I do. I’m engaged to the love of my life, and when I’m not on the road, you’ll find me in the woods, on the water, or working to grow my businesses.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m not trying to be famous, I’m just trying to be honest, entertain people, and maybe inspire a few along the way. If you stick around, you’ll get jokes, a little wisdom, and probably a few stories you wouldn’t want your grandma to hear.\n\nThis is an 18+ event.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",

    "description": "Hailed as “one of the best acoustic guitarists in the world” by NPR’s World Cafe, Tommy Emmanuel got his start at the age of six, when he first began touring his native Australia with his family’s band. As a teenager, he earned a reputation as a highly sought after sideman and session player, and by his early twenties, Emmanuel was playing on chart-topping hits and performing with acts like Air Supply and Men at Work. Inspired in part by his hero, Chet Atkins (who would later become a friend, mentor, and collaborator), Emmanuel stepped out on his own as a solo artist in 1979, releasing the first in a string of acclaimed instrumental albums that would make him an unlikely celebrity in his home country and beyond. In the decades that followed, he would go on to headline everywhere from the Sydney Opera House to Carnegie Hall; tour with luminaries like Eric Clapton and John Denver; win a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement; perform for a televised audience of more than two billion at the Sydney Olympics; and collaborate with a who’s who of fellow guitar greats, including Les Paul, Mark Knopfler, Joe Walsh, Richard Thompson, Jason Isbell, and Billy Strings.\n\n\nRecorded in just four days, Emmanuel’s latest album, Living In The Light, stands as the most daring—and most rewarding—collection in the globetrotting fingerpicker’s remarkable catalog, fusing his pop, jazz, classical, and roots influences into a virtuosic masterwork as exhilarating as it is intimate.\n\n\n\n\nTrey Hensley:\n\n\nGRAMMY® winner and reigning two-time IBMA Guitar Player of the Year Trey Hensley has been called a “musical phenom” by NPR, “a guitar-slinging superhero” by Bluegrass Today, “Nashville’s hottest young player” by Acoustic Guitar magazine, and “the Swiss Army knife of roots music” by WMOT Radio’s Craig Havighurst. Hensley’s artistry has received high praise from the likes of Merle Haggard and Marty Stuart. An Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival invitee who has collaborated with Johnny Cash, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, Taj Mahal and Tommy Emmanuel, Hensley is known for his other-worldly guitar playing, jaw-dropping musicianship and soulful storytelling. Having recently announced his signature guitar with Taylor Guitars, The Trey Hensley Gold Label 510e. Hensley is set to release a new album, Can’t Outrun The Blues, on March 6, 2026. The title cut has spent multiple weeks at #1 on the bluegrass charts.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts",
