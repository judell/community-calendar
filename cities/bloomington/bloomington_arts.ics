SUMMARY: 76 Days Adrift (2025)
DESCRIPTION:From Executive Producer Ang Lee comes 76 Days Adrift—a profou
 ndly immersive documentary that plunges you into the heart of one man’s e
 xtraordinary survival story.\n\nSteven Callahan\, the author of the New Y
 ork Times bestseller Adrift: 76 Days Lost at Sea\, recounts the night of 
 February 4\, 1982\, when a catastrophic collision with a whale left his b
 oat sinking in the dead of night. With the Atlantic Ocean surging into hi
 s vessel\, Steven had only moments to grab what he could before launching
  himself into the dark\, unforgiving sea in a life raft\, clutching a bas
 ic emergency kit.\n\nFor an astonishing 76 days\, that fragile inflatable
  raft became Steven’s entire world as he drifted helplessly across the va
 st expanse of the Atlantic. Forced to confront his deepest fears\, limita
 tions\, and the raw power of nature\, he discovered an inner strength he 
 never knew he possessed.\n\nDirected by Joe Wein and set to a haunting sc
 ore by Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump\, 76 Days Adrift is more than just a 
 survival story—it’s a powerful meditation on human endurance\, resilience
 \, and the profound connection between man and nature.

SUMMARY: Tokyo Olympiad w/Q&A | Cinematic Sports Documentary: History\, P
 olitics\, Aesthetics
DESCRIPTION:Kon Ichikawa’s Tokyo Olympiad paints a stunning picture of em
 otion and spectacle in capturing the 1964 Olympic Games\, held in Tokyo. 
 A feat of cutting-edge technology and cinematography\, the film engages w
 ith the drama already inherent to sport\, offering a vision of triumph an
 d grief—in short\, what makes the Games human—instead of results. Ichikaw
 a’s insistence on the human\, the poetic\, and the aesthetic makes this a
  landmark film in documentary filmmaking. [169 min\; documentary\; Japane
 se with English subtitles]\n\nA Q&A with Dr. Hannah Airriess (IU Departme
 nt of East Asian Languages and Cultures) and Dr. Brandon Wallace (IU Medi
 a School) will follow the screening.

SUMMARY: Groundhog Day (1993)
DESCRIPTION:Cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) finds himsel
 f reliving the same day over and over again in this romantic fantasy\, wh
 en he goes on location to the small town of Punxsutawney to film a report
  about their annual Groundhog Day.\n\nSnowed in during a road-trip expedi
 tion to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow\, Murray falls in
 to a time loop that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doe
 sn’t need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by 
 screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way\, but it’
 s Murray’s world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode\, and
  we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the ava
 ilable juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue\, he makes us 
 understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the rad
 iant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully 
 clueless Cabin Boy (Chris Elliott) is Murray’s nudnik cameraman.\n\nRATED
 : PG\nFORMAT: DCP\nLENGTH: 1hr 45mins

SUMMARY: Night Club Dance Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Drawing on over 45 years of training\, teaching\, and competi
 ng\, Mary Hoedeman has created a clear\, approachable program designed to
  help dancers feel confident\, comfortable\, and successful on the social
  dance floor.\n\nNight Club is a sophisticated and elegant way to slow da
 nce — emphasizing balance\, connection\, musicality\, and ease rather tha
 n memorized patterns or performance.\n\nIn this workshop\, Mary breaks Ni
 ght Club down to its essentials\, identifying only the relevant steps and
  principles needed to accomplish the movement. From there\, dancers are g
 uided through a simple structure repeated 21 times — until the dance smil
 es back.\n\nThis method allows the body to learn naturally through repeti
 tion\, resulting in:\n\n  * Smooth\, relaxed movement\n  * Increased conf
 idence and balance\n  * Clear lead-and-follow connection\n  * A deeper se
 nse of musical timing\n\nThis workshop is appropriate for:\n\n  * New dan
 cers\n  * Experienced social dancers\n  * Anyone wanting a graceful\, con
 fident slow dance they can use immediately\n\nNo partner is required. Rol
 es rotate frequently\, and the environment is welcoming\, supportive\, an
 d grounded in real social dancing.\n\nThis is not about performance or pe
 rfection — it’s about learning to feel good while dancing.

 ion\, and hope in the midst of chaos. With disarming clarity and deep hum
 anity\, he invites us to imagine—and help create—a world where compassion
  is activated as our strongest force for change\, and happiness is within
  reach for everyone.\n\nIn WISDOM OF HAPPINESS\, the Dalai Lama speaks di
 rectly to viewers\, sharing his Tibetan wisdom\, underscoring the oneness
  of humanity\, and offering a message of hope and serenity in troubled ti
 mes. He reflects on how each of us can overcome negative emotions and str
 engthen positive ones like love and compassion\, opening the path to happ
 ier\, more meaningful lives while contributing to a healthier and more ha
 rmonious future. He also emphasizes that the feminine principle of kindne
 ss and connection is urgently needed\, even suggesting the next Dalai Lam
 a may be female.\n\nThe film is a grand and immersive cinematic experienc
 e. The Dalai Lama guides us by asking how “modern” people can find peace 
 of mind despite the stresses of daily life\, the climate crisis\, and the
  anxieties of ongoing wars. That inner calm\, he reminds us\, enables us 
 to create peace and justice outwardly and to take action together.\n\nOne
  of the greatest living thinkers\, the 14th Dalai Lama is now 90 years ol
 d and looks back on a life that has\, perhaps unsurprisingly\, been the s
 ubject of various Hollywood film productions. Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobs
 ang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso\, the Dalai Lama’s full spiritual name\, is one o
 f the most well-known figures of our time. His tenure as the head of Tibe
 tan Buddhists has lasted longer than the reign of Queen Elizabeth II\, gi
 ven that he was enthroned at the age of five.

SUMMARY: Over the Rhine: Infamous Love Songs
DESCRIPTION:BCT & Bloomington Roots present a special Valentine concert: 
 Over the Rhine ~ INFAMOUS LOVE SONGS ~\n\n“Some years ago\, when Johnny C
 ash’s career was undergoing a resurgence during his creative collaboratio
 ns with producer\, Rick Rubin\, someone made an attempt to organize Johnn
 y’s songs into three categories: God\, Love and Death. It occurred to me 
 then that maybe those are the only three subjects available to the writer
 . I have tried to write about all three.\n\nAnd yet\, one night over a la
 te night beverage\, by way of confession\, I admitted to a colleague (a f
 ellow songwriter) that I was embarrassed by the possibility that every so
 ng I had ever written was essentially a love song.\n\nWithout missing a b
 eat he responded\, Well\, maybe\, but you don’t just write about falling 
 in love: you write about what happens further down the road.\n\nI was rel
 ieved and grateful to receive that perspective\, because ladies and gentl
 emen\, we are indeed further down the road. Karin and I have been writing
 \, and making records together as Over the Rhine for 35 years. We’ve been
  married for 29 of those. Long live musical couples. Johnny and June migh
 t be our patron saints\, but they are not the only ones. A significant sw
 ath of our favorite music over the years has been made by that rare and e
 ndangered breed of exotic zoo animal: the musical couple. (The list inclu
 des Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\, Buddy and Julie Miller\, Richard a
 nd Linda Thompson\, The Innocence Mission and others.) But back to furthe
 r down the road… Poet Christina Rosetti famously wrote the lines: Does th
 e road wind uphill all the way? Yes\, to the very end.\n\nFew things in l
 ife get easier as the years pass. But from this vantage point\, after 35 
 years of climbing\, we can see the broader view. We can see the two songw
 riters who were stoned on love and words and possibility. We can see the 
 couple who almost called it a day\, and yet found their way into — and wi
 th — each other. We learned that we tend two separate gardens: the garden
  of our career in music\, and the garden of our life together well apart 
 from the noise of the music industry.\n\nWe know well the thrill of openi
 ng shows for Bob Dylan or Lucinda Williams\, getting to play at Newport F
 olk Festival\, or in Japan\, or New Zealand. And checking those things of
 f our dream list was indeed a thrill. Seeing the world on the backs of th
 e songs. Watching a community coalesce around our music that crossed bord
 ers and boundaries.\n\nAnd now it is also the deeper abiding joy of quiet
 ly walking two Irish Wolfhounds in the cool of the evening. At home. Bein
 g together. The fact that we can still make each other laugh. Sharing a s
 tory that’s still being written. We live together on a small farm\, grow 
 songs\, host concerts in the restored barn\, and curate and host Nowhere 
 Else Festival — our very own music and arts festival\, the festival that 
 we were always looking for but never quite found until we built it oursel
 ves. Both/and.\n\nWe have written a lifetime of love songs in all shapes 
 and sizes. We were curious as to what an evening devoted entirely to the 
 possibilities of love songs might feel like. And so\, come Valentine’s Da
 y\, we’re going to go find a few favorite stages\, and find out. We hope 
 you’ll join us.”\n\nLinford Detweiler (w/Karin Bergquist close by)\nSepte

 l\, role. Jon Brion (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\, Magnolia) he
 lps fuel the narrative with a baroque\, futurist score that helps Punch-D
 runk Love channel "the spirit of classic Hollywood musicals and the whims
 y of Jacques Tati into an idiosyncratic ode to the delirium of new romanc
 e" (Criterion Collection). [95 min\; drama\, comedy\, romance\; English]

SUMMARY: Vienna Teng
DESCRIPTION:Songwriter Vienna Teng re-emerges this fall with her mashup s
 ong pair We’ve Got You – her first new music in over a decade – but her f
 ans have been here the whole time.\n\nThey’ve packed concert venues even 
 in years between releases\, crowdfunded an ambitious music video in hours
 \, and joined by the hundreds when she launched her “music x climate acti
 on” Patreon in 2022.\n\nThat kind of devotion has poured forth since 2002
 ’s Waking Hour\, which landed her on NPR’s Weekend Edition\, The Late Sho
 w with David Letterman\, and the top of Amazon’s music charts. Across fou
 r more studio albums that followed – the chamber folk of Warm Strangers\,
  the jazz-inflected Dreaming Through the Noise\, the indie epic Inland Te
 rritory\, the bright electro-pop in Aims – Vienna has paid homage to her 
 genre-bending heroes like Paul Simon and Tori Amos\, while carving a path
  all her own. Together with her captivating live performances and thought
 ful online presence\, her work has built a loyal following across generat
 ions and continents.\n\nVienna’s new mini-EP We’ve Got You reflects the c
 omplexity of her life over the past decade: climate change work\, communi
 ty building\, parenthood. Two songs\, each titled “We’ve Got You\,” act l
 ike fraternal twins: one an indie-pop tribute to inspiring leaders\, the 
 other a chamber-folk paean to unsung caregivers. Played simultaneously\, 
 they reveal a new intricate whole: a mashup by design\, and a love letter
  to social movements.\n\nAppropriately\, Vienna now also hosts climate ac
 tion workshops on tour and online\, which participants have described as 
 “rocket fuel” and “the perfect antidote to despair.”\n\nIt’s an exciting 
 new chapter in the ever-evolving love story between an artist and her aud
 ience.

 is the REAL story of the guys I played with and the league that was so im
 portant to all of us. It made me cry and it made me proud. I want EVERYON
 E to see this.” “Dr Dunk” Darnell Hillman\, 3-time ABA Champion\, Winner 
 of first NBA Slam Dunk Contest\n\n“Here’s me explicitly asking you to ple

SUMMARY: Eyes Without a Face/ The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus | Undergr
 ound Film Series
DESCRIPTION:An influential touchpoint in the horror canon\, Georges Franj
 u's provocative yet initially unheralded Eyes Without a Face follows the 
 unraveling of a plastic surgeon determined to operate on his daughter aft
 er an accident disfigures her face\, and he uses the skin of others to do
  so. The film did not draw much attention in the States upon initial rele
 ase\, but it has since grown a reputation as a distinctly poetic piece of
  horror cinema. When it was released in the United States\, Eyes Without 
 a Face was re-cut\, dubbed into English\, and retitled as The Horror Cham
 ber of Dr. Faustus. This screening will be a 35mm presentation of this ve
 rsion. [81 min\; horror\; English]

SUMMARY: Altan
DESCRIPTION:“THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE CELTIC REALM” – The Boston Globe\n\n
 “A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN” and “THE BEST TRADITIONAL IRISH BAND” – Dolly Pa
 rton on her collaboration with Altan on two of her albums Heartsongs (199
 4) and Little Sparrow (2001)\n\nThe spirit and sound of Altan comes from 
 the deep and rich musical tradition of their native Co. Donegal. On one o
 f his many visits to the Donegal Gaeltacht of Gaoth Dobhair\, Belfast bor
 n flute player Frankie Kennedy met fiddler and singer Mairead Ní Mhaonai
 gh\, sparking off a deep musical connection\, marriage in 1981\, and a jo
 urney that took them all over the world. Their vision was to bring the un
 ique repertoire of Donegal music to the world and that mission is still a
 s strong as ever.\n\nIn the mid 80s\, Mairead and Frankie recruited bouzo
 uki player Ciaran Curran from Fermanagh\, whose intricate counterpoint is
  at the center of the Altan sound\, and guitarist Mark Kelly from Dublin\
 , whose mastery of a wide palette of guitar styles and harmonic vocabular
 y add a breadth and depth of color. As a band\, Altan played their first 
 concert on June 1st 1985\, in St. John’s Church in Listowel\, Co. Kerry a
 t the famous Listowel Writers Week.\n\nTheir first album\, simply titled 
 Altan was released in 1987 and quickly followed by Horse with A Heart\, w
 hich saw the inclusion of Paul O’Saughnessy on fiddle. Paul had joined th
 e band on its first US tours\, lending his stunning virtuosity and in-dep
 th knowledge of the Donegal style. He performed on the subsequent three a
 lbums. In 1992\, the album Harvest Storm brought with it Dáithí Sproule
  on guitar\, himself one of the pioneers of guitar in Irish traditional a
 nd folk music\, having played with the wonderful Skara Brae with the O’Do
 mhnaill family and Buncrana native Ciaran Tourish who excelled in fiery c
 ounterpoint fiddle.\n\nOne of the band’s finest hours came with the relea
 se of Island Angel in 1993\, which was recognized by Billboard World Musi
 c Charts as the second biggest selling world music album globally in 1994
  and in the same year\, Altan performed for Bill Clinton at the White Hou
 se. The band would play for US Presidents over the course of their career
  as well as accompanying Irish Presidents on their state visits. Shortly 
 after the release of this album\, the legendary accordionist Dermot Byrne
  joined the band.\n\nSadly\, on September 19th\,1994\, the band and wider
  world of music was dealt a devastating blow with the death of founding m
 ember Frankie Kennedy. His vision\, artistry and sense of fun is still at
  the heart of Altan and his legacy is carried and celebrated in every not
 e. A record deal with Virgin Records followed in 1996\, which catapulted 
 the band on an extensive touring schedule over the subsequent decade. Thi
 s period saw them working with many of the great American performers such
  as Dolly Parton\, recording on her album Heartsongs (1994) and its follo
 w up\, Little Sparrow 2001\; she returned the favor on the band’s record 
 The Blue Idol in 2002 by dieting with Mairéad on the song The Pretty Youn
 g Girl. The band have traveled with Ireland’s President Mary MacAleese an
 d President Michael D. Higgins on state visits abroad to Japan\, North Ko
 rea and Italy. President Higgins invited them to join him in his residenc
 e\, Aras an Uachtaraá in in 2018 to celebrate their 30 years as a band. 
 The Donegal County Council held a civic reception in their offices to mar
 k the occasion in May 2018. In 2006 the Irish Government also honored Alt
 an by putting them on an official postal stamp to celebrate their contrib
 ution to the Irish culture one of the highest honors to be bestowed on an
  Irish citizen.\n\nMartin Tourish a past TG4 Young Musician of the Year\,
  took the accordion seat in late 2013 and the band recorded their album T
 he Widening Gyre in Nashville with many of the great Bluegrass and Americ
 an performers\, such as Mary Chapin Carpenter\, Jerry Douglas and Alison 
 Brown. This album explored the connections between Irish and Bluegrass mu
 sic\, a particularly special moment of which was performing at The Grand 
 Ole Opry with Ricky Skaggs in 2016.\n\nIn 2017\, the band released their 
 first book\, Altan: The Tunes\, based on a collection of 222 melodies tha
 t they collected recorded over their 30 year history. Martin Tourish tran
 scribed the dance music and meticulously interviewed all the band members
  for additional stories and background information. Containing a detailed
  commentary on each of the tunes\, it is the only collection of Donegal m
 usic currently in print.\n\nMairead Ní Mhaonaigh was awarded Donegal Per
 son of the Year in 2008 and the coveted TG4 Gradaim Ceoil (Music Award) 2
 017\, for her musicianship and singing. The highest accolade which a trad
 itional musician can receive in Ireland.\n\nIn celebration of the band’s 
 latest album\, The Gap of Dreams\, the band has brought their music all o
 ver Europe and Ireland\, the US and Canada\, Japan\, Australia and even N
 orth Africa. The latest album celebrates the roots of their music in Done
 gal folklore. It was recorded in the Attica Studios in the mountains of D
 onegal which contributed to a wonderful atmosphere which permeated throug
 hout the recording. The title refers to that ‘gap’ or ‘door’ between this
  and the ‘other world.’ The older fiddlers \, whom they got their music f
 rom\, always associated with the “other world” as the source for their mu
 sic and inspiration. They would describe poetically about encountering th
 e fairy folk or listening to tunes on the wind or on the shore listening 
 to the sound of the waves.\n\nIn creativity the ‘Gap of Dreams” is never 
 shut. http://www.altan.ie/\n\nwww.facebook.com/altanofficial https://www.

SUMMARY: Zach Rushing “Redneck Logic” Comedy Tour
DESCRIPTION:I’m just a Mississippi boy with a loud mouth and a big heart.
  I grew up believing in hard work\, good friends\, and telling it like it
  is\, and I never really grew out of that. Most people know me from my co
 medy\, where I’ve built a career on being unapologetically myself. Whethe
 r I’m on stage for the Not-So-Rich-And-Famous Tour\, raising hell on soci
 al media\, or telling stories that hit a little too close to home\, I try
  to keep it real and keep people laughing.\n\nBut I’m more than just a co
 mic. I run Triple B Outdoors\, where I get to share my love for hunting\,
  fishing\, and the outdoors with folks who live for the same things I do.
  I’m engaged to the love of my life\, and when I’m not on the road\, you’
 ll find me in the woods\, on the water\, or working to grow my businesses
 .\n\nAt the end of the day\, I’m not trying to be famous\, I’m just tryin
 g to be honest\, entertain people\, and maybe inspire a few along the way
 . If you stick around\, you’ll get jokes\, a little wisdom\, and probably
  a few stories you wouldn’t want your grandma to hear.\n\nThis is an 18+ 
 event.

 st daring—and most rewarding—collection in the globetrotting fingerpicker
 ’s remarkable catalog\, fusing his pop\, jazz\, classical\, and roots inf
 luences into a virtuosic masterwork as exhilarating as it is intimate.\n\
 n\n\n\nTrey Hensley:\n\n\nGRAMMY® winner and reigning two-time IBMA Guita

  received high praise from the likes of Merle Haggard and Marty Stuart. A
 n Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival invitee who has collaborated 
 with Johnny Cash\, Vince Gill\, Dolly Parton\, Taj Mahal and Tommy Emmanu
 el\, Hensley is known for his other-worldly guitar playing\, jaw-dropping
