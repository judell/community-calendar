 n bassist\, composer\, producer\, and educator whose work engages tango a
 s a living musical tradition‚Äîshaped by history\, performance practice\,
  dance\, and social context\, and continually reactivated through contemp
 orary practice. His career unfolds at the intersection of tango\, jazz\, 
 and classical music\, combining creative work\, scholarship\, and transmi
 ssion in a sustained dialogue between Argentina and the United States. Af
 ter moving to the United States in 1980\, Aslan earned a B.A. in Music fr
 om the University of California\, Santa Cruz\, and later pursued graduate
  studies at CalArts and an M.F.A. in Bass Performance at UCLA. His master
 's recital\, "BASS‚ÄìTANGO\," and accompanying thesis\, "Tango: Stylistic

 k in the early 1990s\, Aslan deepened his engagement with tango through e
 nsembles such as New York Buenos Aires Connection and New York Tango Trio
 \, and through a formative partnership with bandoneonist Ra√∫l Jaurena. T
 his period culminated in his participation as bassist in Yo-Yo Ma's Soul

 rned both Grammy and Latin Grammy nominations. During this period\, Aslan
  presented his work at Jazz at Lincoln Center and served as music directo
 r for Paquito D'Rivera's Tango Jazz Ensemble. Subsequent projects\, inclu
 ding Piazzolla in Brooklyn\, reflect an interpretive engagement with repe
 rtory that treats Piazzolla as open musical material. Aslan has maintaine
 d an extensive career as a record producer\, producing for Soundbrush Rec
 ords and founding Avantango Records. He has received two Latin Grammy Awa
 rds as a producer. He has donated his personal tango archive to the Latin
  American Music Center at Indiana University. Now based for extended peri
 ods in Buenos Aires\, he remains actively engaged in the contemporary tan
 go and jazz scenes.Aram Arakelyan is senior lecturer in music in collabor

SUMMARY:Nisaika Quartet: Violaine Melan√ßon\, violin\; David Salness\, vi

DESCRIPTION:Repertoire  Webern: Langsamer Satz (1905)Beethoven: String Qu
 artet in E-Flat Major\, Op. 74 (1809) ("Harp")Puccini: Crisantemi (1890)B
 rahms: String Sextet No. 2 in G Major\, Op. 36 (1865)About the Artists  D
 escribed by Strad Magazine as being "vigorous\, extrovert and emphatic pl
 ayers with a vitality all their own\," the young Nisaika Quartet\, all ba
 rely 20 years old\, had just won the Deuxi√®me Prix at the 8e Concours In
 ternational de Quatuors √† Cordes in Evian\, France\, (later the Bordeaux
  International String Quartet Competition) from a jury presided by Polish
  composer Witold Lutos≈Çawski and comprising among others cellist Claus A
 dam (Juilliard String Quartet)\, Hatto Beyerle (Alban Berg Quartet)\, Pao
 lo Borciani (Quartetto Italiano)\, Milan Skampa (Smetana Quartet)\, and t
 he entire Borodine Quartet. This was in 1983. This foursome of chamber-mu
 sic-hungry friends and classmates at the Curtis Institute of Music had de
 cided to spend most of the previous year locking themselves into rehearsa
 l studios for marathon work sessions of Mozart\, Beethoven\, and Bart√≥k.
  With the support of their coaches\, Karen Tuttle and Felix Galimir\, the
 y lived one of the great adventures of their musical lives. Being young a
 nd in full development\, the quartet disbanded to pursue graduate studies
  and job opportunities\, yet somehow remained connected for all these dec
 ades\, collaborating and performing during summer festivals\, subbing for
  one another during sabbatical and maternity leaves\, founding other ense
 mbles. But their association marked them deeply and started defining thei
 r identity. Several of the choices they made then were an example of thei
 r idealism. At a time where only the Emerson String Quartet traded violin
  seats\, the Nisaika followed suit. They chose a name that was all-inclus
 ive\, the word Nisaika meaning "we\, us\, our" in Chinook pidgin\, a trad
 ing language of the Pacific Northwest\, including elements of French\, En
 glish\, Salishan\, and other indigenous languages. Violinist David Salnes
 s threw a bottle in the ocean a year ago with the idea of a reunion tour 
 in 2025-26\, which was pretty rapidly and enthusiastically embraced by th
 e whole group.  An artist deeply dedicated to the range of violin and cha
 mber music repertoire\, violinist Violaine Melan√ßon is sought after both
  as a performer and a pedagogue. She teaches at the Schulich School of Mu
 sic at McGill University\, where she is associate professor of violin\, a
 nd regularly gives master classes and guest teaches at major peer institu
 tions\, including the New England Conservatory in Boston\, Glenn Gould Sc
 hool in Toronto\, Royal Conservatoire of Scotland\, and Guildhall School 
 for Music and Drama in London. She served until 2019 on the faculty of th
 e Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. Melan√ßon was\, until 2016 and durin
 g the ensemble's life span\, the founding violinist of the Peabody Trio\,
  ensemble-in-residence at the Peabody Conservatory\, and the Yellow Barn 
 Center for Chamber Music\, and with them actively performed international
 ly. These days\, she teaches during the summer months at Domaine Forget I
 nternational Music and Dance Academy\, the Green Mountain Chamber Music F
 estival\, and the Summer Violin Institute at Northwestern University Bien
 en School of Music in Chicago. Melan√ßon performs as well on baroque viol
 in and enjoys collaborating in concert with many Canadian and American ea
 rly music performers. Her performances can be heard on the Naxos\, Artek\
 , CRI\, and New World Records labels. Visit www.Melan√ßonmelancon for mor
 e information.  Violinist David Salness has attained international recogn
 ition as a performing artist and teacher. He has appeared in more than 30

  members of the Guarneri\, Cleveland\, and Juilliard quartets\, and is cu
 rrently the first violinist with the Left Bank Quartet\, appearing freque
 ntly in the greater Washington\, D.C.\, area performing in leading venues

 cher of violin at the Brevard Music Center\, and chamber music program di
 rector at the Chautauqua Festival. The longtime director of chamber music
  activities at the University of Maryland\, he is currently professor of

 f his generation\, and his students now populate the viola sections of ma
 ny orchestras\, including the Boston\, St. Louis\, and Indianapolis symph
 ony orchestras\; and many others in the United States\, Europe\, Asia\, a
 nd South America. Gazouleas was a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra

 demand as an orchestral clinician around the country. Gazouleas is a 1984
  graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music where he studied viola with Mi
 chael Tree and Karen Tuttle. He joined the Curtis faculty in 2017 and was
  named the Gie and Lisa Liem Artistic Director in 2021 and provost in 202
 2.Peter Stumpf is professor of music (cello) at the Indiana University Ja
 cobs School of Music. Prior to this appointment\, he was principal cellis
 t of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Stumpf's tenure in Los Angeles followe
 d 12 years as associate principal cellist of the Philadelphia Orchestra. 
 His professional orchestral career began at age 16 when he joined the cel
 lo section of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. He earned a bachelor's deg
 ree from the Curtis Institute of Music (CIM) and an Artist Diploma from t
 he New England Conservatory. A dedicated chamber music musician\, he is a
  member of the Johannes String Quartet and has appeared on chamber music

 ieties of Boston and Philadelphia and at the Casals Festival in Puerto Ri
 co\, as well as such festivals as Marlboro\, Spoleto\, and Aspen. He has

 hony\, Philadelphia Orchestra\, Los Angeles Philharmonic\, and Boston Phi
 lharmonic\, among many others. As a recitalist\, he has performed at the 
 Universities of Hartford\, Syracuse\, and Delaware\, at Jordan Hall in Bo
 ston\, and at the Philips and Corcoran Galleries in Washington\, D.C. Mos
 t recently\, he performed J. S. Bach's Six Suites for Solo Cello on serie
 s in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. His awards include first prize in the 
 Washington International\, Graham-Stahl\, and Aspen Concerto Competitions
 \, and second prize in the Evian International String Quartet Competition
 . As a teacher\, he has served on the faculties of the University of Sout
 hern California\, Hartt School of Music\, and New England Conservatory\, 
 and he was guest artist faculty at CIM\, Yellow Barn Music Festival\, and
  Musicorda Summer String Program.Stephen Wyrczynski is professor of music
  in viola at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music\, where he has
  been on faculty since 2010. He has been an artist-faculty member at the 
 Aspen Music Festival and School since 2006. Wyrczynski was a member of th
 e Philadelphia Orchestra for 18 years\, joining in 1992. He earned his ba
 chelor degree from The Juilliard School in 1988 and a diploma from the Cu

  Texas\; and with the Apollo Chamber Players\, Denver\, Colorado. Wyrczyn
 ski also performs regularly with his artist faculty colleagues at the Jac
 obs School of Music and participates in faculty-student collaborations. O
 ne such partnership\, which he co-founded with colleague Jorja Fleezanis\
 , violin\, is an ongoing exploration of music from the Second Viennese Sc
 hool\, in which faculty and students together perform music by Schoenberg
 \, Webern\, and Berg. Wyrczynski considers his teaching a direct result o
 f his own relationship to performing\, practicing\, and listening. He app
 roaches each student as an individual personality and potential artist. T
 eaching a student about the great privilege it is to serve the composers 
 of our repertoire is one of the best ways for the students to gain owners
 hip of their musical training. He encourages students to ask probing ques
 tions and be musically curious beyond their own instrument.

 uerto Rico\; and El Paso Pro Musica\, Texas\; and with the Apollo Chamber

  artist faculty colleagues at the Jacobs School of Music and participates
  in faculty-student collaborations. One such partnership\, which he co-fo
 unded with colleague Jorja Fleezanis\, violin\, is an ongoing exploration
  of music from the Second Viennese School\, in which faculty and students
  together perform music by Schoenberg\, Webern\, and Berg. Wyrczynski con
 siders his teaching a direct result of his own relationship to performing
 \, practicing\, and listening. He approaches each student as an individua
 l personality and potential artist. Teaching a student about the great pr
 ivilege it is to serve the composers of our repertoire is one of the best
  ways for the students to gain ownership of their musical training. He en
 courages students to ask probing questions and be musically curious beyon
 d their own instrument.</p>

 s of foreign musicians and critics in Soviet Russia during the interwar p

 This project studies the negotiated musicianship as represented by the Si
 no-Soviet Friendship Association (SSFA) in Dalian\, China\, during the Ko

 een genuine inter-personal friendship and intricate interstate politics w
 ithin the Communist world.  Grace Pechianu\, "Diplomacy in the Ether: Rad
 io Free Europe and Romanian Exiles as Jazz Ambassadors"The defected jazz 
 pianist Eugen Ciceu credited jazz programs from Voice of America\, Radio 
 Liberty\, and Radio Free Europe for shaping his musicianship in socialist
  Romania. This talk follows Ciceu's trajectory as a consumer-turned-contr
 ibutor of American counterpropaganda on his Radio Free Europe interview a
 nd performance from 1964 while assessing radio's role in enabling exiles 
 to serve as cultural diplomats.  Lynn M. Hooker\, "State Folk Ensembles: 
 Shock Troops of the Cultural Cold War or Cash Cow?"Across the East Bloc a

 or (arr. for two electric guitars)\, BWV 1043Daniel Duarte: Mozart vs. Be
 ethoven (2025)2026 Guitar Extravaganza  The 2026 Guitar Extravaganza feat
 ures the guitar as a flexible\, border-crossing instrument. The repertoir
 e moves from medieval chant to Baroque counterpoint\, from flamenco and L
 atin American song to Brazilian choro\, jazz fusion\, and newly composed 
 work. Rather than presenting these styles as isolated traditions\, the co
 ncert places them in dialogue\, showing how the guitar inhabits a multitu
 de of musical traditions over centuries of history. The featured guitars 
 have different timbres\, shapes\, and colors\, but are unified by traditi
 on.  Several works on the program involve transformation. Canonical reper
 toire is reimagined\, including an arrangement of Bach's Double Violin Co
 ncerto for electric guitars and string ensemble\, with banjo and steel-st
 ring guitars serving as basso continuo. These adaptations are not simple 
 transfers of notes. Changes in timbre\, sustain\, articulation\, and bala
 nce reshape how we hear familiar structures. Mozart vs. Beethoven feature
 s well know themes by both classical giants through the unique Electric G
 uitar Orchestra. The result invites listeners to reconsider well-known mu
 sic through a contemporary sound world.  Collaboration is another central
  thread. The pairing of pipa with other plucked instruments\, such as the
  charango\, mandolin and requinto highlights connections among distinct s
 tring traditions. Latin American songs emphasize the guitar's enduring ro
 le as partner to the voice\, while flamenco and jazz reflect traditions l
 ess commonly associated with the classical guitar. Collaboration is also 
 a central part of this extravaganza\, bringing together Jacobs students a
 nd faculty and guest artist Zoe J. Stewart\, guitarist and executive dire
 ctor of the Guitar Foundation of America.  The inclusion of a world premi
 ere points toward the instrument's future as much as its past. New repert
 oire sustains artistic growth and expands what the guitar ensemble can be
 . Taken as a whole\, this program presents the guitar not as confined to 
 a single genre or identity\, but as a versatile medium capable of bridgin
 g historical periods\, cultural contexts\, and performance practices. The
  work\, Raindrop Army by Gulli Bj√∂rnsson\, reimagines guitar ensemble mu
 sic\, bringing together AI-generated images\, electronics\, the organ\, a
 nd guitar ensemble.About the ArtistsDaniel Duarte is senior lecturer in m
 usic in guitar at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. He is an
  active guitarist\, arranger\, conductor\, and lecturer who has collected

 ng>2026 Guitar Extravaganza<br /></strong><br />  The 2026 Guitar Extrava
 ganza features the guitar as a flexible\, border-crossing instrument. The
  repertoire moves from medieval chant to Baroque counterpoint\, from flam
 enco and Latin American song to Brazilian choro\, jazz fusion\, and newly
  composed work. Rather than presenting these styles as isolated tradition
 s\, the concert places them in dialogue\, showing how the guitar inhabits
  a multitude of musical traditions over centuries of history. The feature
 d guitars have different timbres\, shapes\, and colors\, but are unified 
 by tradition.<br /><br />  Several works on the program involve transform
 ation. Canonical repertoire is reimagined\, including an arrangement of B
 ach's Double Violin Concerto for electric guitars and string ensemble\, w
 ith banjo and steel-string guitars serving as basso continuo. These adapt
 ations are not simple transfers of notes. Changes in timbre\, sustain\, a
 rticulation\, and balance reshape how we hear familiar structures. <em>Mo
 zart vs. Beethoven</em> features well know themes by both classical giant
 s through the unique Electric Guitar Orchestra. The result invites listen
 ers to reconsider well-known music through a contemporary sound world.<br
  /><br />  Collaboration is another central thread. The pairing of pipa w
 ith other plucked instruments\, such as the charango\, mandolin and requi
 nto highlights connections among distinct string traditions. Latin Americ
 an songs emphasize the guitar's enduring role as partner to the voice\, w
 hile flamenco and jazz reflect traditions less commonly associated with t
 he classical guitar. Collaboration is also a central part of this extrava
 ganza\, bringing together Jacobs students and faculty and guest artist Zo
 e J. Stewart\, guitarist and executive director of the Guitar Foundation 
 of America.<br /><br />  The inclusion of a world premiere points toward 
 the instrument's future as much as its past. New repertoire sustains arti
 stic growth and expands what the guitar ensemble can be. Taken as a whole
 \, this program presents the guitar not as confined to a single genre or 
 identity\, but as a versatile medium capable of bridging historical perio
 ds\, cultural contexts\, and performance practices. The work\, <em>Raindr
 op Army</em> by Gulli Bj√∂rnsson\, reimagines guitar ensemble music\, bri
 nging together AI-generated images\, electronics\, the organ\, and guitar
  ensemble.<br /><br /><strong>About the Artists</strong><br /><br /><stro
