SUMMARY:Nisaika Quartet: Violaine Melançon\, violin\; David Salness\, vi
 olin\; Edward Gazouleas\, viola\; Peter Stumpf\, cello
DESCRIPTION:Repertoire  Webern: Langsamer Satz (1905)Beethoven: String Qu
 artet in E-Flat Major\, Op. 74 (1809) ("Harp")Puccini: Crisantemi (1890)B
 rahms: String Sextet No. 2 in G Major\, Op. 36 (1865)About the Artists  D
 escribed by Strad Magazine as being "vigorous\, extrovert and emphatic pl
 ayers with a vitality all their own\," the young Nisaika Quartet\, all ba
 rely 20 years old\, had just won the Deuxième Prix at the 8e Concours In
 ternational de Quatuors à Cordes in Evian\, France\, (later the Bordeaux
  International String Quartet Competition) from a jury presided by Polish
  composer Witold Lutosławski and comprising among others cellist Claus A
 dam (Juilliard String Quartet)\, Hatto Beyerle (Alban Berg Quartet)\, Pao
 lo Borciani (Quartetto Italiano)\, Milan Skampa (Smetana Quartet)\, and t
 he entire Borodine Quartet. This was in 1983. This foursome of chamber-mu
 sic-hungry friends and classmates at the Curtis Institute of Music had de
 cided to spend most of the previous year locking themselves into rehearsa
 l studios for marathon work sessions of Mozart\, Beethoven\, and Bartók.
  With the support of their coaches\, Karen Tuttle and Felix Galimir\, the
 y lived one of the great adventures of their musical lives. Being young a
 nd in full development\, the quartet disbanded to pursue graduate studies
  and job opportunities\, yet somehow remained connected for all these dec
 ades\, collaborating and performing during summer festivals\, subbing for
  one another during sabbatical and maternity leaves\, founding other ense
 mbles. But their association marked them deeply and started defining thei
 r identity. Several of the choices they made then were an example of thei
 r idealism. At a time where only the Emerson String Quartet traded violin
  seats\, the Nisaika followed suit. They chose a name that was all-inclus
 ive\, the word Nisaika meaning "we\, us\, our" in Chinook pidgin\, a trad
 ing language of the Pacific Northwest\, including elements of French\, En
 glish\, Salishan\, and other indigenous languages. Violinist David Salnes
 s threw a bottle in the ocean a year ago with the idea of a reunion tour 
 in 2025-26\, which was pretty rapidly and enthusiastically embraced by th
 e whole group.  An artist deeply dedicated to the range of violin and cha
 mber music repertoire\, violinist Violaine Melançon is sought after both
  as a performer and a pedagogue. She teaches at the Schulich School of Mu
 sic at McGill University\, where she is associate professor of violin\, a
 nd regularly gives master classes and guest teaches at major peer institu
 tions\, including the New England Conservatory in Boston\, Glenn Gould Sc
 hool in Toronto\, Royal Conservatoire of Scotland\, and Guildhall School 
 for Music and Drama in London. She served until 2019 on the faculty of th
 e Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. Melançon was\, until 2016 and durin
 g the ensemble's life span\, the founding violinist of the Peabody Trio\,
  ensemble-in-residence at the Peabody Conservatory\, and the Yellow Barn 
 Center for Chamber Music\, and with them actively performed international
 ly. These days\, she teaches during the summer months at Domaine Forget I
 nternational Music and Dance Academy\, the Green Mountain Chamber Music F
 estival\, and the Summer Violin Institute at Northwestern University Bien
 en School of Music in Chicago. Melançon performs as well on baroque viol
 in and enjoys collaborating in concert with many Canadian and American ea
 rly music performers. Her performances can be heard on the Naxos\, Artek\
 , CRI\, and New World Records labels. Visit www.Melançonmelancon for mor
 e information.  Violinist David Salness has attained international recogn
 ition as a performing artist and teacher. He has appeared in more than 30
  countries and in virtually the entire United States in such renowned ven
 ues as Carnegie Hall\, Lincoln Center\, Orchestra Hall in Chicago\, Paris
 's Salle Gaveau\, and London's Wigmore Hall. His performances are broadca
 st on National Public Radio\, Radio France\, and the British and Canadian
  Broadcast Corporations. His recordings are found on the RCA\, BMG\, Tela
 rc\, and Centaur labels\, amongst others. Salness was for 12 years a memb
 er of the critically acclaimed Audubon Quartet. He has worked with iconic
  composers\, such as Luciano Berio\, George Crumb\, Krystof Penderecki\, 
 Peter Schickele\, and John Cage\, while premiering countless works throug
 hout his career. A sought-after collaborator\, Salness has performed with
  members of the Guarneri\, Cleveland\, and Juilliard quartets\, and is cu
 rrently the first violinist with the Left Bank Quartet\, appearing freque
 ntly in the greater Washington\, D.C.\, area performing in leading venues
 \, including the Kennedy Center\, National Gallery\, the Smithsonian\, an
 d Strathmore Hall. Salness has been concertmaster of Northern Virginia's 
 Fairfax Symphony Orchestra for 28 years. An alumnus of the Interlochen Ar
 ts Academy and the Curtis Institute\, Salness studied with David Cerone\,
  Jascha Brodsky\, Ivan Galamian\, Joseph Gingold\, and Karen Tuttle. He h

 cher of violin at the Brevard Music Center\, and chamber music program di
 rector at the Chautauqua Festival. The longtime director of chamber music
  activities at the University of Maryland\, he is currently professor of 
 violin.  Violist Ed Gazouleas has emerged as one of the finest teachers o
 f his generation\, and his students now populate the viola sections of ma
 ny orchestras\, including the Boston\, St. Louis\, and Indianapolis symph
 ony orchestras\; and many others in the United States\, Europe\, Asia\, a
 nd South America. Gazouleas was a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra
  for 24 years\, where he held the Lois and Harlan Anderson Viola Chair an
 d led the viola section on many occasions\, notably with conductors such 
 as Colin Davis\, Kurt Masur\, and André Previn. While in Boston\, he was

 layers\, and the principal string players of the Cleveland Orchestra. Gaz
 ouleas works to expand and promote new works for the viola and has collab
 orated with such composers as Michael Tippett\, John Harbison\, and Osval
 do Golijov. In 2019\, he performed the North American premiere of Letters
  from Warsaw by English composer Joseph Phibbs. Gazouleas has also served
  on the faculties of the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as a t
 enured professor\, Boston University College of Fine Arts\, Boston Conser
 vatory\, Wellesley College\, and New England Conservatory. He is also in 
 demand as an orchestral clinician around the country. Gazouleas is a 1984
  graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music where he studied viola with Mi
 chael Tree and Karen Tuttle. He joined the Curtis faculty in 2017 and was
  named the Gie and Lisa Liem Artistic Director in 2021 and provost in 202

 cobs School of Music. Prior to this appointment\, he was principal cellis

 His professional orchestral career began at age 16 when he joined the cel
 lo section of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. He earned a bachelor's deg
 ree from the Curtis Institute of Music (CIM) and an Artist Diploma from t
 he New England Conservatory. A dedicated chamber music musician\, he is a

 hern California\, Hartt School of Music\, and New England Conservatory\, 
 and he was guest artist faculty at CIM\, Yellow Barn Music Festival\, and

 ne such partnership\, which he co-founded with colleague Jorja Fleezanis\
 , violin\, is an ongoing exploration of music from the Second Viennese Sc
 hool\, in which faculty and students together perform music by Schoenberg
 \, Webern\, and Berg. Wyrczynski considers his teaching a direct result o
 f his own relationship to performing\, practicing\, and listening. He app
 roaches each student as an individual personality and potential artist. T
 eaching a student about the great privilege it is to serve the composers 
 of our repertoire is one of the best ways for the students to gain owners
 hip of their musical training. He encourages students to ask probing ques
 tions and be musically curious beyond their own instrument.Kam Kin Chen b

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<p><strong>Repertoire</strong><br />  Webern
 : <em>Langsamer Satz (1905)<br /></em>Beethoven: <em>String Quartet in E-
 Flat Major\, Op. 74 (1809) ("Harp")<br /></em>Puccini: <em>Crisantemi (18

 br /></em><br /><strong>About the Artists</strong><br /><br />  Described
  by <em>Strad Magazine</em> as being "vigorous\, extrovert and emphatic p
 layers with a vitality all their own\," the young <strong>Nisaika Quartet
 </strong>\, all barely 20 years old\, had just won the Deuxième Prix at 
 the 8<sup>e</sup> Concours International de Quatuors à Cordes in Evian\,
  France\, (later the Bordeaux International String Quartet Competition) f
 rom a jury presided by Polish composer Witold Lutosławski and comprising
  among others cellist Claus Adam (Juilliard String Quartet)\, Hatto Beyer
 le (Alban Berg Quartet)\, Paolo Borciani (Quartetto Italiano)\, Milan Ska
 mpa (Smetana Quartet)\, and the entire Borodine Quartet. This was in 1983
 . This foursome of chamber-music-hungry friends and classmates at the Cur
 tis Institute of Music had decided to spend most of the previous year loc
 king themselves into rehearsal studios for marathon work sessions of Moza
 rt\, Beethoven\, and Bartók. With the support of their coaches\, Karen T
 uttle and Felix Galimir\, they lived one of the great adventures of their
  musical lives. Being young and in full development\, the quartet disband
 ed to pursue graduate studies and job opportunities\, yet somehow remaine
 d connected for all these decades\, collaborating and performing during s
 ummer festivals\, subbing for one another during sabbatical and maternity
  leaves\, founding other ensembles. But their association marked them dee
 ply and started defining their identity. Several of the choices they made
  then were an example of their idealism. At a time where only the Emerson
  String Quartet traded violin seats\, the Nisaika followed suit. They cho
 se a name that was all-inclusive\, the word Nisaika meaning "we\, us\, ou
 r" in Chinook pidgin\, a trading language of the Pacific Northwest\, incl
 uding elements of French\, English\, Salishan\, and other indigenous lang
 uages. Violinist David Salness threw a bottle in the ocean a year ago wit
 h the idea of a reunion tour in 2025-26\, which was pretty rapidly and en
 thusiastically embraced by the whole group.<br /><br />  An artist deeply
  dedicated to the range of violin and chamber music repertoire\, violinis
 t <strong>Violaine Melançon</strong> is sought after both as a performer
  and a pedagogue. She teaches at the Schulich School of Music at McGill U
 niversity\, where she is associate professor of violin\, and regularly gi
 ves master classes and guest teaches at major peer institutions\, includi
 ng the New England Conservatory in Boston\, Glenn Gould School in Toronto
 \, Royal Conservatoire of Scotland\, and Guildhall School for Music and D
 rama in London. She served until 2019 on the faculty of the Peabody Conse
 rvatory in Baltimore. Melançon was\, until 2016 and during the ensemble'
 s life span\, the founding violinist of the Peabody Trio\, ensemble-in-re
 sidence at the Peabody Conservatory\, and the Yellow Barn Center for Cham
 ber Music\, and with them actively performed internationally. These days\
 , she teaches during the summer months at Domaine Forget International Mu
 sic and Dance Academy\, the Green Mountain Chamber Music Festival\, and t
 he Summer Violin Institute at Northwestern University Bienen School of Mu
 sic in Chicago. Melançon performs as well on baroque violin and enjoys c
 ollaborating in concert with many Canadian and American early music perfo
 rmers. Her performances can be heard on the Naxos\, Artek\, CRI\, and New
  World Records labels. Visit www.Melançonmelancon for more information.<

 the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music as a tenured professor\, Bo
 ston University College of Fine Arts\, Boston Conservatory\, Wellesley Co
 llege\, and New England Conservatory. He is also in demand as an orchestr
 al clinician around the country. Gazouleas is a 1984 graduate of the Curt
 is Institute of Music where he studied viola with Michael Tree and Karen 
 Tuttle. He joined the Curtis faculty in 2017 and was named the Gie and Li
 sa Liem Artistic Director in 2021 and provost in 2022.<br /><br /><strong

 rsity Jacobs School of Music. Prior to this appointment\, he was principa
 l cellist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Stumpf's tenure in Los Angeles
  followed 12 years as associate principal cellist of the Philadelphia Orc
 hestra. His professional orchestral career began at age 16 when he joined
  the cello section of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. He earned a bachel

  of Southern California\, Hartt School of Music\, and New England Conserv
 atory\, and he was guest artist faculty at CIM\, Yellow Barn Music Festiv
 al\, and Musicorda Summer String Program.<br /><br /><strong>Stephen Wyrc
 zynski</strong> is professor of music in viola at the Indiana University 
 Jacobs School of Music\, where he has been on faculty since 2010. He has 
 been an artist-faculty member at the Aspen Music Festival and School sinc
 e 2006. Wyrczynski was a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 18 year
 s\, joining in 1992. He earned his bachelor degree from The Juilliard Sch
 ool in 1988 and a diploma from the Curtis Institute of Music in 1991. His
  principal teachers were Kim Kashkashian\, Karen Tuttle\, and Joseph DePa
 squale. As a chamber musician\, Wyrczynski has performed with such artist
 s as Joshua Bell\, Sarah Chang\, Pamela Frank\, Edgar Meyer\, Vladimir Fe
 ltsman\, and Dawn Upshaw. He has played in many of North America's most c

 uerto Rico\; and El Paso Pro Musica\, Texas\; and with the Apollo Chamber
  Players\, Denver\, Colorado. Wyrczynski also performs regularly with his
  artist faculty colleagues at the Jacobs School of Music and participates
  in faculty-student collaborations. One such partnership\, which he co-fo
 unded with colleague Jorja Fleezanis\, violin\, is an ongoing exploration
  of music from the Second Viennese School\, in which faculty and students
  together perform music by Schoenberg\, Webern\, and Berg. Wyrczynski con
 siders his teaching a direct result of his own relationship to performing
 \, practicing\, and listening. He approaches each student as an individua
 l personality and potential artist. Teaching a student about the great pr
 ivilege it is to serve the composers of our repertoire is one of the best
  ways for the students to gain ownership of their musical training. He en
 courages students to ask probing questions and be musically curious beyon
 d their own instrument.<br /><br /><strong>Kam Kin Chen</strong> began st
 udying cello at a young age and earned a Bachelor of Music degree at The 
 Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts under the guidance of Ray Wang. He

 24 performance at Carnegie Weill Recital Hall and appeared as a soloist w
 ith the Hong Kong Children's Symphony Orchestra at the Hong Kong City Hal

 an School of Music Scholarship (2023-2025) and the HKSAR Government Schol
 arship for Outstanding Performances (2019-2023). He also earned a Fellow 
 of Trinity College London diploma in piano (2018). Chen continues to insp
 ire young musicians and push the boundaries of his own artistry through t
 eaching and performance.</p>

SUMMARY:Harmony and Power: A Summit on Cultural Diplomacy presented by th
 e Hamilton Lugar School and Jacobs School of Music
DESCRIPTION:With panel discussions\, presentations\, workshops\, and conc
 erts\, Harmony and Power will explore how cultural diplomacy shapes power
  and global connections. Participants include renowned scholars\, practit
 ioners\, performers\, and students from a variety of disciplines.  &#160\
 ;SCHEDULE OF EVENTS:9:00-11:30 │Historical Panel: "Music and Cold-War D
 iplomacy"  Kevin Bartig\, "Behind the Iron Curtain Before the Iron Curtai
 n: Western Musicians in the Soviet Union During the Interwar Period"In th
 is presentation\, I reconstruct the largely forgotten activities of forei
 gn musicians and critics in Soviet Russia during the interwar period. Thr
 ough concert tours and residencies\, these visitors moved information and
  ideas across borders\, shaped Soviet musical self-identity\, and effecte
 d a form of cultural exchange that prefigures—and complicates conventio
 nal narratives of—later Cold War musical exchange with the Soviet Union
 .  Bess Liu\, "'Big Brother is Listening!' Music\, Friendship\, and the S
 ino-Soviet Relations during the Korean War (1950-1953)"This project studi
 es the negotiated musicianship as represented by the Sino-Soviet Friendsh
 ip Association (SSFA) in Dalian\, China\, during the Korean War (1950-195
 3). Musical diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union\, at this critic
 al historical moment\, entails contrasting stories between genuine inter-
 personal friendship and intricate interstate politics within the Communis
 t world.  Grace Pechianu\, "Diplomacy in the Ether: Radio Free Europe and
  Romanian Exiles as Jazz Ambassadors"The defected jazz pianist Eugen Cice
 u credited jazz programs from Voice of America\, Radio Liberty\, and Radi
 o Free Europe for shaping his musicianship in socialist Romania. This tal
 k follows Ciceu's trajectory as a consumer-turned-contributor of American
  counterpropaganda on his Radio Free Europe interview and performance fro
 m 1964 while assessing radio's role in enabling exiles to serve as cultur
 al diplomats.  Lynn Hooker\, "State Folk Ensembles: Shock Troops of the C
 ultural Cold War or Cash Cow?"Across the East Bloc and elsewhere\, staged
  folkdance groups were some of the most prominent representatives of the 
 culture of socialist states. As well as being cultural diplomats\, they e
 arned important income from Western audiences. Press coverage and oral hi
 stories from the Hungarian League of Young Communists' Rajkó Ensemble re
 veal the complexities of this role.  Danielle Lussier-Fosler\, "The Marke
 t Effects of Propaganda: Government Money and the 'New Music' Boom"When t
 he US government used music as propaganda\, the effects of those programs
  were noticeable at home as well as abroad. Despite claims that the gover
 nment did not subsidize the arts\, government funding for music propagand
 a established strong incentives for the creation\, publication\, and reco
 rding of contemporary concert music.11:45-12:45 │ "Conversations with E

 ultural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco\, 
 Wallace was exposed to blues\, country and western\, R&amp\;B\, jazz\, an
 d Afro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment o
