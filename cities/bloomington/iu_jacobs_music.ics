 tudied Afro-Colombian currulao\, cumbia\, and bullerengue in Colombia wit
 h La Wey Segura\, Francis Lara\, and Emilsen Pacheco\, later returning on

SUMMARY:Harmony and Power: A Summit on Cultural Diplomacy presented by th

DESCRIPTION:With panel discussions\, presentations\, workshops\, and conc
 erts\, Harmony and Power will explore how cultural diplomacy shapes power
  and global connections. Participants include renowned scholars\, practit
 ioners\, performers\, and students from a variety of disciplines.  &#160\
 ;SCHEDULE OF EVENTS:9:00-11:30 â”‚Historical Panel: "Music and Cold-War D
 iplomacy"  Kevin Bartig\, "Behind the Iron Curtain Before the Iron Curtai
 n: Western Musicians in the Soviet Union During the Interwar Period"In th
 is presentation\, I reconstruct the largely forgotten activities of forei
 gn musicians and critics in Soviet Russia during the interwar period. Thr
 ough concert tours and residencies\, these visitors moved information and
  ideas across borders\, shaped Soviet musical self-identity\, and effecte
 d a form of cultural exchange that prefiguresâ€”and complicates conventio
 nal narratives ofâ€”later Cold War musical exchange with the Soviet Union
 .  Bess Liu\, "'Big Brother is Listening!' Music\, Friendship\, and the S
 ino-Soviet Relations during the Korean War (1950-1953)"This project studi
 es the negotiated musicianship as represented by the Sino-Soviet Friendsh
 ip Association (SSFA) in Dalian\, China\, during the Korean War (1950-195
 3). Musical diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union\, at this critic
 al historical moment\, entails contrasting stories between genuine inter-
 personal friendship and intricate interstate politics within the Communis
 t world.  Grace Pechianu\, "Diplomacy in the Ether: Radio Free Europe and
  Romanian Exiles as Jazz Ambassadors"The defected jazz pianist Eugen Cice
 u credited jazz programs from Voice of America\, Radio Liberty\, and Radi
 o Free Europe for shaping his musicianship in socialist Romania. This tal
 k follows Ciceu's trajectory as a consumer-turned-contributor of American
  counterpropaganda on his Radio Free Europe interview and performance fro
 m 1964 while assessing radio's role in enabling exiles to serve as cultur
 al diplomats.  Lynn Hooker\, "State Folk Ensembles: Shock Troops of the C
 ultural Cold War or Cash Cow?"Across the East Bloc and elsewhere\, staged
  folkdance groups were some of the most prominent representatives of the 
 culture of socialist states. As well as being cultural diplomats\, they e
 arned important income from Western audiences. Press coverage and oral hi
 stories from the Hungarian League of Young Communists' RajkÃ³ Ensemble re
 veal the complexities of this role.  Danielle Lussier-Fosler\, "The Marke
 t Effects of Propaganda: Government Money and the 'New Music' Boom"When t
 he US government used music as propaganda\, the effects of those programs
  were noticeable at home as well as abroad. Despite claims that the gover
 nment did not subsidize the arts\, government funding for music propagand
 a established strong incentives for the creation\, publication\, and reco
 rding of contemporary concert music.11:45-12:45 â”‚ "Conversations with E

 ><br /><strong>Wayne Wallace</strong> is professor of practice in jazz st
 udies and jazz trombone at the IU Jacobs School of Music. A seven-time Gr
 ammy nominee\, he is one of the most respected exponents of African Ameri
 can Latin music in the world today. Wallace is known for his use of tradi
 tional forms and styles in combination with contemporary music and has ea
 rned wide critical acclaim\, including placement in both the trombone and
  producer categories of the <em>DownBeat</em> Critics Poll. An accomplish
 ed arranger\, educator\, and composer with compositions for film and tele
 vision\, he has received grants from the Creative Work Fund\, the Nationa
 l Endowment for the Arts\, the Lila Wallace Foundation\, and the San Fran
 cisco Arts Commission. Wallace has performed\, recorded\, and studied wit
 h many acknowledged masters of the Afro-Latin and jazz idioms\, such as A
 retha Franklin\, Bobby Hutcherson\, Earth Wind and Fire\, Pete Escovedo\,
  Santana\, and many more. This experience has provided a solid foundation
  for Wallace's current explorations of the intersections of a wealth of c
 ultural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco\, 
 Wallace was exposed to blues\, country and western\, R&amp\;B\, jazz\, an
 d Afro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment o
 f the San Francisco Bay Area shaped his career. His studies of Afro-Latin
  music and jazz include trips to Cuba\, New York City\, and Puerto Rico. 
 Widely respected as a teacher and historian\, Wallace has taught at San J
 osÃ© State University\, Stanford University\, and the Jazzschool in Berke
 ley. He has conducted lectures\, workshops\, and clinics in the Americas 
 and Europe since 1983. Head of the critically acclaimed Patois Records\, 
 Wallace has created a unique record label with a passionate mission of de
 veloping and chronicling the multilingual styles of the San Francisco Bay
  Area music scene. Under his direction the label has released 13 recordin
 gs to critical acclaim\, including recordings by Wallace\, Marc and Paul 
 van Wageningen\, and vocalists Kat Parra\, Alexa Weber-Morales\, and Kris
 tina. He is an endorser of Conn-Selmer trombones.<br /><br /><strong>Andy

 avigates the diverse world of percussion with technical and musical preci
 sion across a broad range of artistic practices. Fostering a deep interes
 t in the percussion music of the African diaspora\, Miller has studied wi
 th master percussionists in the United States and internationally. A Fulb

  and bullerengue in Colombia with La Wey Segura\, Francis Lara\, and Emil
 sen Pacheco\, later returning on a Presser Graduate Music Award to study 
 joropo music with Fernando Torres Ramirez. Miller conducted field researc
 h in Brazil with Jorge AlabÃª for his doctoral project\, "The Language of
  Drumming in Afro-Brazilian CandomblÃ© Ketu." His study of bomba percussi
 on\, song\, and dance took him to Puerto Rico to study with Beto Torrens\
 , MariÃ©n Torres\, Rafa Maya\, and Hector "Coco" BarÃ©z. He studied Guine
 an mande drumming with Bolokada Conde and Afro-Cuban folkloric and popula
 r percussion with Michael Spiro. Miller also champions percussion art mus

 s University Orchestra. Commissions include <em>Maria JosÃ©</em> by Luis 
 Fernando Sanchez Gooding\, <em>Silent Surface</em> by Rafael Llanos\, and
  <em>Monologue IV: BilingÃ¼ismo</em> by JosÃ© Martinez. His commitment to
  new music has led to residencies with the Bang on a Can Summer Music Fes
 tival and the Atlantic Music Festival Contemporary Ensemble. His collabor
 ations with choreographers as a composer/performer have premiered in New 
 York City\, throughout the Midwest\, and internationally. Miller served a
 s music director of the University of Wisconsinâ€“Milwaukee Dance Departm
