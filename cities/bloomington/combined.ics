SUMMARY: UP (2009) $5 movie night
DESCRIPTION:February 17th is National Random Acts of Kindness Day! Get ou
 t there with spontaneous acts of generosity\, compassion\, and goodwill f
 or others with the goal of spreading joy and positivity. And then bring y
 our loved ones and family to see this fantastically warm Pixar film\, “Up
 ” for $5 each.\n\nCarl Fredricksen\, a retired balloon salesman and widow
 er\, is part rascal\, part dreamer and ready for his last chance at high-
 flying excitement. Tying thousands of balloons to his house\, Carl sets o
 ff to South America and the lost world of his childhood dreams in order t
 o fulfill a promise that he made to his late wife. But unbeknownst to cur
 mudgeon Carl\, an overeager 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer who has never 
 ventured beyond his backyard is in the wrong place at the wrong time… Car
 l’s front porch.\n\nThe world’s most unlikely duo reach new heights and m
 eet fantastic friends like Dug\, a dog with a special collar that allows 
 him to speak\, and Kevin\, a rare 13-foot-tall flightless bird. Stuck tog
 ether in the wilds of the jungle\, Carl realizes that sometimes life’s bi
 ggest adventures aren’t the ones you set out to have.\n\nReviewers say “U
 p” is an emotional and imaginative film exploring love\, loss\, and adven
 ture\, and praise its poignant storytelling and opening sequence.\n\nRATE

SUMMARY: DJ Ahmet | International Art House Series
DESCRIPTION:Ahmet\, a 15-year-old boy from a remote Yuruk village in Nort
 h Macedonia\, finds refuge in music while navigating his father’s expecta
 tions\, a conservative community\, and his first experience with love—a g
 irl whose future is already promised to someone else. Georgi M. Unkovski'
 s debut feature is a delightfully inspiring tale as old as time\, told in
  a romantic and rebellious new way. A devoted shepherd longing for more t
 han green pastures and the bleating of his faithful herd\, Ahmet enlists 
 his younger brother Naim to help him capture the attention (and hopefully
 \, affections) of village beauty Aya\, who is begrudgingly betrothed to a
 nother. Did we mention there's a banging soundtrack and neon pink sheep t
 o move the plot along? Winner of the Sundance World Cinema Dramatic Speci
 al Jury Award for Creative Vision. [99 min\; comedy\, drama\; Turkish\, M
 acedonian\, and English with English subtitles]\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

SUMMARY: Vienna Teng
DESCRIPTION:Songwriter Vienna Teng re-emerges this fall with her mashup s
 ong pair We’ve Got You – her first new music in over a decade – but her f
 ans have been here the whole time.\n\nThey’ve packed concert venues even 
 in years between releases\, crowdfunded an ambitious music video in hours
 \, and joined by the hundreds when she launched her “music x climate acti
 on” Patreon in 2022.\n\nThat kind of devotion has poured forth since 2002
 ’s Waking Hour\, which landed her on NPR’s Weekend Edition\, The Late Sho
 w with David Letterman\, and the top of Amazon’s music charts. Across fou
 r more studio albums that followed – the chamber folk of Warm Strangers\,
  the jazz-inflected Dreaming Through the Noise\, the indie epic Inland Te
 rritory\, the bright electro-pop in Aims – Vienna has paid homage to her 
 genre-bending heroes like Paul Simon and Tori Amos\, while carving a path
  all her own. Together with her captivating live performances and thought
 ful online presence\, her work has built a loyal following across generat
 ions and continents.\n\nVienna’s new mini-EP We’ve Got You reflects the c
 omplexity of her life over the past decade: climate change work\, communi
 ty building\, parenthood. Two songs\, each titled “We’ve Got You\,” act l
 ike fraternal twins: one an indie-pop tribute to inspiring leaders\, the 
 other a chamber-folk paean to unsung caregivers. Played simultaneously\, 
 they reveal a new intricate whole: a mashup by design\, and a love letter
  to social movements.\n\nAppropriately\, Vienna now also hosts climate ac
 tion workshops on tour and online\, which participants have described as 
 “rocket fuel” and “the perfect antidote to despair.”\n\nIt’s an exciting 
 new chapter in the ever-evolving love story between an artist and her aud
 ience.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

  hardest paths together. Told through varying timelines\, audiences will 
 follow Roland (Bill Goveia) and Marianne (Emily Bedwell) from first dates
  to heartbreak to reconnection and beyond.\n\nAfter the Storm Productions

SUMMARY: After the Storm presents "Constellations"
DESCRIPTION:What happens when a beekeeper and a cosmologist meet at a BBQ
 ? It sounds like the setup for a joke\, but instead it's the opening of a
  powerful story of love\, loss\, finding and losing love\, and facing the
  hardest paths together. Told through varying timelines\, audiences will 
 follow Roland (Bill Goveia) and Marianne (Emily Bedwell) from first dates
  to heartbreak to reconnection and beyond.\n\nAfter the Storm Productions
  is Bloomington's newest theater company. We are focused on using theater
  as a means for facing and exploring trauma.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

SUMMARY: John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection w/ Q&A | Cinematic Spor
 ts Documentary: History\, Politics\, Aesthetics
DESCRIPTION:Julien Faraut’s John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection expl
 ores the tennis legend’s psyche and emotion on the court of the 1984 Fren
 ch Open. Through 16mm film\, Faraut reimagines athletic performance as ci
 nematic and aesthetic performance\, blurring the boundaries between these
  two seemingly separate categories. McEnroe’s obsession and volatility ar
 e transformed into an aesthetic consideration of performance and emotion 
 in one of the contemporary period’s most inventive sport documentaries. [
 95 min\; documentary\; English and French with English subtitles]\n\nA Q&
 A will follow the screening.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

 bout foul language in your set\, we do not allow racist\, homophobic\, tr
 ansphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist

 , slam dunk contest\, fashion and culture innovators–but then are forgott
 en in a business deal gone bad.\n\nThe Waiting Game is a powerful documen
 tary that reveals an incredible battle between the NBA and a tiny not-for
 -profit working to gain full recognition for the men of the ABA. It’s a f
 ight for benefits the players of the ABA felt were promised\, but never d
 elivered. While following an investigation of the legal trail of the ABA-
 NBA merger\, key impact journalism and the advocacy for justice\, the fil
 m reveals the lines that can stand between raw corporate interest and bas
 ic human dignity.\n\n“I’m an ABA guy. I got my start there. This is a ver
 y important film with a genuine hero at the center.” Bob Costas\n\n“This 
 is the REAL story of the guys I played with and the league that was so im
 portant to all of us. It made me cry and it made me proud. I want EVERYON
 E to see this.” “Dr Dunk” Darnell Hillman\, 3-time ABA Champion\, Winner 
 of first NBA Slam Dunk Contest\n\n“Here’s me explicitly asking you to ple
 ase watch Michael Husain’s documentary as soon as possible and recommend 
 it to your nearest NBA fanatic so that they can raise their voice for the
  legends associated with the ABA.” Pramit Chatterjee\, Rotten Tomato Revi

SUMMARY: Haiku Tunnel | Staff Selects
DESCRIPTION:Haiku Tunnel defies comparison. A workplace comedy unlike Off
 ice Space\, based on a dramatic monologue yet nothing like the work of Sp
 alding Gray\, and featuring a neurotic lead but completely different from
  What About Bob. What Haiku Tunnel is is a deeply funny film about anxiet
 y\, work\, love\, and 17 very important letters that absolutely must go o

 ssistant Director of Cinema Technology Seth Mutchler says\, “Just trust m

SUMMARY: Eyes Without a Face/ The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus | Undergr
 ound Film Series
DESCRIPTION:An influential touchpoint in the horror canon\, Georges Franj
 u's provocative yet initially unheralded Eyes Without a Face follows the 
 unraveling of a plastic surgeon determined to operate on his daughter aft
 er an accident disfigures her face\, and he uses the skin of others to do
  so. The film did not draw much attention in the States upon initial rele
 ase\, but it has since grown a reputation as a distinctly poetic piece of
  horror cinema. When it was released in the United States\, Eyes Without 
 a Face was re-cut\, dubbed into English\, and retitled as The Horror Cham
 ber of Dr. Faustus. This screening will be a 35mm presentation of this ve
 rsion. [81 min\; horror\; English]\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

SUMMARY: Altan
DESCRIPTION:“THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE CELTIC REALM” – The Boston Globe\n\n
 “A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN” and “THE BEST TRADITIONAL IRISH BAND” – Dolly Pa
 rton on her collaboration with Altan on two of her albums Heartsongs (199
 4) and Little Sparrow (2001)\n\nThe spirit and sound of Altan comes from 
 the deep and rich musical tradition of their native Co. Donegal. On one o
 f his many visits to the Donegal Gaeltacht of Gaoth Dobhair\, Belfast bor
 n flute player Frankie Kennedy met fiddler and singer Mairead Ní Mhaonai
 gh\, sparking off a deep musical connection\, marriage in 1981\, and a jo
 urney that took them all over the world. Their vision was to bring the un
 ique repertoire of Donegal music to the world and that mission is still a
 s strong as ever.\n\nIn the mid 80s\, Mairead and Frankie recruited bouzo
 uki player Ciaran Curran from Fermanagh\, whose intricate counterpoint is
  at the center of the Altan sound\, and guitarist Mark Kelly from Dublin\
 , whose mastery of a wide palette of guitar styles and harmonic vocabular
 y add a breadth and depth of color. As a band\, Altan played their first 
 concert on June 1st 1985\, in St. John’s Church in Listowel\, Co. Kerry a
 t the famous Listowel Writers Week.\n\nTheir first album\, simply titled 
 Altan was released in 1987 and quickly followed by Horse with A Heart\, w
 hich saw the inclusion of Paul O’Saughnessy on fiddle. Paul had joined th
 e band on its first US tours\, lending his stunning virtuosity and in-dep
 th knowledge of the Donegal style. He performed on the subsequent three a
 lbums. In 1992\, the album Harvest Storm brought with it Dáithí Sproule
  on guitar\, himself one of the pioneers of guitar in Irish traditional a
 nd folk music\, having played with the wonderful Skara Brae with the O’Do
 mhnaill family and Buncrana native Ciaran Tourish who excelled in fiery c
 ounterpoint fiddle.\n\nOne of the band’s finest hours came with the relea
 se of Island Angel in 1993\, which was recognized by Billboard World Musi
 c Charts as the second biggest selling world music album globally in 1994
  and in the same year\, Altan performed for Bill Clinton at the White Hou
 se. The band would play for US Presidents over the course of their career
  as well as accompanying Irish Presidents on their state visits. Shortly 
 after the release of this album\, the legendary accordionist Dermot Byrne
  joined the band.\n\nSadly\, on September 19th\,1994\, the band and wider
  world of music was dealt a devastating blow with the death of founding m
 ember Frankie Kennedy. His vision\, artistry and sense of fun is still at
  the heart of Altan and his legacy is carried and celebrated in every not
 e. A record deal with Virgin Records followed in 1996\, which catapulted 
 the band on an extensive touring schedule over the subsequent decade. Thi
 s period saw them working with many of the great American performers such
  as Dolly Parton\, recording on her album Heartsongs (1994) and its follo
 w up\, Little Sparrow 2001\; she returned the favor on the band’s record 
 The Blue Idol in 2002 by dieting with Mairéad on the song The Pretty Youn
 g Girl. The band have traveled with Ireland’s President Mary MacAleese an
 d President Michael D. Higgins on state visits abroad to Japan\, North Ko
 rea and Italy. President Higgins invited them to join him in his residenc
 e\, Aras an Uachtaraá in in 2018 to celebrate their 30 years as a band. 
 The Donegal County Council held a civic reception in their offices to mar
 k the occasion in May 2018. In 2006 the Irish Government also honored Alt
 an by putting them on an official postal stamp to celebrate their contrib
 ution to the Irish culture one of the highest honors to be bestowed on an
  Irish citizen.\n\nMartin Tourish a past TG4 Young Musician of the Year\,
  took the accordion seat in late 2013 and the band recorded their album T
 he Widening Gyre in Nashville with many of the great Bluegrass and Americ
 an performers\, such as Mary Chapin Carpenter\, Jerry Douglas and Alison 
 Brown. This album explored the connections between Irish and Bluegrass mu
 sic\, a particularly special moment of which was performing at The Grand 
 Ole Opry with Ricky Skaggs in 2016.\n\nIn 2017\, the band released their 
 first book\, Altan: The Tunes\, based on a collection of 222 melodies tha
 t they collected recorded over their 30 year history. Martin Tourish tran
 scribed the dance music and meticulously interviewed all the band members
  for additional stories and background information. Containing a detailed
  commentary on each of the tunes\, it is the only collection of Donegal m
 usic currently in print.\n\nMairead Ní Mhaonaigh was awarded Donegal Per
 son of the Year in 2008 and the coveted TG4 Gradaim Ceoil (Music Award) 2
 017\, for her musicianship and singing. The highest accolade which a trad
 itional musician can receive in Ireland.\n\nIn celebration of the band’s 
 latest album\, The Gap of Dreams\, the band has brought their music all o
 ver Europe and Ireland\, the US and Canada\, Japan\, Australia and even N
 orth Africa. The latest album celebrates the roots of their music in Done
 gal folklore. It was recorded in the Attica Studios in the mountains of D
 onegal which contributed to a wonderful atmosphere which permeated throug
 hout the recording. The title refers to that ‘gap’ or ‘door’ between this
  and the ‘other world.’ The older fiddlers \, whom they got their music f
 rom\, always associated with the “other world” as the source for their mu
 sic and inspiration. They would describe poetically about encountering th
 e fairy folk or listening to tunes on the wind or on the shore listening 
 to the sound of the waves.\n\nIn creativity the ‘Gap of Dreams” is never 
 shut. http://www.altan.ie/\n\nwww.facebook.com/altanofficial https://www.

 ural styles and rhythmic concepts. Born and raised in San Francisco\, Wal
 lace was exposed to blues\, country and western\, R&amp\;B\, jazz\, and A
 fro-Caribbean music at an early age. The fertile musical environment of t

 istic practices. Fostering a deep interest in the percussion music of the
  African diaspora\, Miller has studied with master percussionists in the 
 United States and internationally. A Fulbright grant recipient\, Miller s
 tudied Afro-Colombian currulao\, cumbia\, and bullerengue in Colombia wit
 h La Wey Segura\, Francis Lara\, and Emilsen Pacheco\, later returning on
  a Presser Graduate Music Award to study joropo music with Fernando Torre
 s Ramirez. Miller conducted field research in Brazil with Jorge Alabê fo
 r his doctoral project\, "The Language of Drumming in Afro-Brazilian Cand
 omblé Ketu." His study of bomba percussion\, song\, and dance took him t
 o Puerto Rico to study with Beto Torrens\, Marién Torres\, Rafa Maya\, a

 ;SCHEDULE OF EVENTS:9:00-11:30 │Historical Panel: "Music and Cold-War D
 iplomacy"  Kevin Bartig\, "Behind the Iron Curtain Before the Iron Curtai
 n: Western Musicians in the Soviet Union During the Interwar Period"In th
 is presentation\, I reconstruct the largely forgotten activities of forei
 gn musicians and critics in Soviet Russia during the interwar period. Thr
 ough concert tours and residencies\, these visitors moved information and
  ideas across borders\, shaped Soviet musical self-identity\, and effecte
 d a form of cultural exchange that prefigures—and complicates conventio
 nal narratives of—later Cold War musical exchange with the Soviet Union
 .  Bess Liu\, "'Big Brother is Listening!' Music\, Friendship\, and the S
 ino-Soviet Relations during the Korean War (1950-1953)"This project studi
 es the negotiated musicianship as represented by the Sino-Soviet Friendsh
 ip Association (SSFA) in Dalian\, China\, during the Korean War (1950-195
 3). Musical diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union\, at this critic
 al historical moment\, entails contrasting stories between genuine inter-
 personal friendship and intricate interstate politics within the Communis
 t world.  Grace Pechianu\, "Diplomacy in the Ether: Radio Free Europe and
  Romanian Exiles as Jazz Ambassadors"The defected jazz pianist Eugen Cice
 u credited jazz programs from Voice of America\, Radio Liberty\, and Radi
 o Free Europe for shaping his musicianship in socialist Romania. This tal
 k follows Ciceu's trajectory as a consumer-turned-contributor of American
  counterpropaganda on his Radio Free Europe interview and performance fro
 m 1964 while assessing radio's role in enabling exiles to serve as cultur
 al diplomats.  Lynn Hooker\, "State Folk Ensembles: Shock Troops of the C
 ultural Cold War or Cash Cow?"Across the East Bloc and elsewhere\, staged
  folkdance groups were some of the most prominent representatives of the 
 culture of socialist states. As well as being cultural diplomats\, they e
 arned important income from Western audiences. Press coverage and oral hi
 stories from the Hungarian League of Young Communists' Rajkó Ensemble re
 veal the complexities of this role.  Danielle Lussier-Fosler\, "The Marke
 t Effects of Propaganda: Government Money and the 'New Music' Boom"When t
 he US government used music as propaganda\, the effects of those programs
  were noticeable at home as well as abroad. Despite claims that the gover
 nment did not subsidize the arts\, government funding for music propagand
 a established strong incentives for the creation\, publication\, and reco

SUMMARY: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid | 5X Series: Robert Redford
DESCRIPTION:Loosely based on the true story of a band of outlaws who elud
 ed the U.S. government after committing train robberies\, Butch Cassidy a
 nd the Sundance Kid stars two of the biggest names of the 1960s\, Paul Ne
 wman and Robert Redford\, as the titular outlaws who must flee to Bolivia
  when the law gets too close. Encapsulating the anti-authoritarian mental
 ity of its era\, this endlessly quotable and offbeat western has been bel
 oved by audiences for decades—and rightfully so. [110 min\; western\, com

SUMMARY: Deaf President Now! | New Americas Cinema
DESCRIPTION:Deaf President Now! recounts the eight days of historic prote
 sts held at Gallaudet University in 1988 after the school’s board of trus
 tees appointed a hearing president over several very qualified Deaf candi
 dates. After a week of rallies\, boycotts\, and protests\, the students o
 f Gallaudet University triumph over an uncaring board and administration 
 as the hearing president resigns and beloved dean Dr. I. King Jordan beco
 mes the university’s first Deaf president. The protests marked a pivotal 
 moment in civil rights history\, with an impact that extended well beyond
  the Gallaudet campus\, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabili
 ties Act (ADA). [100 min\; documentary\; American Sign Language and Engli
 sh with English subtitles]\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

SUMMARY: To Be or Not to Be | 5x Series: Robert Redford
DESCRIPTION:Please note that one $10 ticket gets you access to all four f
 ilms in the Hoosiers on Screen marathon. Ticketholders can come and go as
  they please during the films\, plus snacks\, drinks in resealable/enclos
 ed containers (there are no cupholders in the Cinema!)\, and finger foods
  that do not emit a strong odor will be allowed for this special event. A
 lcohol\, cigarettes\, electronic cigarettes\, and illicit drugs are prohi
 bited at IU Cinema.\n\nAs nervy as it is hilarious\, this screwball maste
 rpiece from Ernst Lubitsch stars Jack Benny and\, in her final screen app
 earance\, Carole Lombard as husband-and-wife thespians in Nazi-occupied W
 arsaw who become caught up in a dangerous spy plot. To Be or Not to Be is
  a Hollywood film of the boldest black humor\, which went into production
  right before the U.S. entered World War II. Lubitsch manages to brillian
 tly balance political satire\, romance\, slapstick\, and wartime suspense
  in a comic high-wire act that has never been equaled. [99 min\; comedy\;
  English\, German\, and French]\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

DESCRIPTION:Please note that one $10 ticket gets you access to all four f

 stment banker Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) receives a strange gif
 t from his ne’er-do-well younger brother (Sean Penn) on his birthday: a v
 oucher for a game that\, if he agrees to play it\, will change his life. 
 Thus begins a trip down the rabbit hole that is puzzling\, terrifying\, a
 nd exhilarating for Nicholas and viewers alike. This multilayered\, noiri
 sh descent into one man’s personal hell is also a surreal\, metacinematic
  journey that\, two years after the phenomenon Se7en\, further demonstrat
 ed that director David Fincher was one of Hollywood’s true contemporary v

SUMMARY: Bug | Transfixed: Michael Shannon on Screen\, Jorgensen Guest Fi
 lmmaker Series
DESCRIPTION:Michael Shannon and Ashley Judd give searing performances in 
 this skin-crawling exercise in fear and paranoia from director William Fr
 iedkin. Oklahoma waitress Aggie (Judd) lives a largely solitary life in a
  rundown motel. She's haunted by a tragic past and hounded by her ex-con 
 ex-husband (Harry Connick\, Jr.). When she sparks a romance with an eccen
 tric drifter\, Peter Evans (Shannon)\, she starts to feel hopeful again—u
 ntil Peter reveals he is a victim of government experimentation. The coup
 le begins to obsess over the nightmarish idea that they are infected by i
 nsects. Shannon reprises the role he originated in playwright Tracy Letts
 ' original London production of the same name. [102 min\; drama\, thrille
 r\, horror\; English]\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

SUMMARY: Zach Rushing “Redneck Logic” Comedy Tour
DESCRIPTION:I’m just a Mississippi boy with a loud mouth and a big heart.
  I grew up believing in hard work\, good friends\, and telling it like it
  is\, and I never really grew out of that. Most people know me from my co
 medy\, where I’ve built a career on being unapologetically myself. Whethe
 r I’m on stage for the Not-So-Rich-And-Famous Tour\, raising hell on soci
 al media\, or telling stories that hit a little too close to home\, I try
  to keep it real and keep people laughing.\n\nBut I’m more than just a co
 mic. I run Triple B Outdoors\, where I get to share my love for hunting\,
  fishing\, and the outdoors with folks who live for the same things I do.
  I’m engaged to the love of my life\, and when I’m not on the road\, you’
 ll find me in the woods\, on the water\, or working to grow my businesses
 .\n\nAt the end of the day\, I’m not trying to be famous\, I’m just tryin
 g to be honest\, entertain people\, and maybe inspire a few along the way
 . If you stick around\, you’ll get jokes\, a little wisdom\, and probably
  a few stories you wouldn’t want your grandma to hear.\n\nThis is an 18+ 
 event.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts

 bout foul language in your set\, we do not allow racist\, homophobic\, tr
 ansphobic or rape/female bashing jokes. If you have to ask if it's racist

SUMMARY: Tommy Emmanuel CGP - Living In The Light Tour
DESCRIPTION:Hailed as “one of the best acoustic guitarists in the world” 
 by NPR’s World Cafe\, Tommy Emmanuel got his start at the age of six\, wh
 en he first began touring his native Australia with his family’s band. As
  a teenager\, he earned a reputation as a highly sought after sideman and
  session player\, and by his early twenties\, Emmanuel was playing on cha
 rt-topping hits and performing with acts like Air Supply and Men at Work.
  Inspired in part by his hero\, Chet Atkins (who would later become a fri
 end\, mentor\, and collaborator)\, Emmanuel stepped out on his own as a s
 olo artist in 1979\, releasing the first in a string of acclaimed instrum
 ental albums that would make him an unlikely celebrity in his home countr
 y and beyond. In the decades that followed\, he would go on to headline e
 verywhere from the Sydney Opera House to Carnegie Hall\; tour with lumina
 ries like Eric Clapton and John Denver\; win a Grammy Award for Best Inst
 rumental Arrangement\; perform for a televised audience of more than two 
 billion at the Sydney Olympics\; and collaborate with a who’s who of fell
 ow guitar greats\, including Les Paul\, Mark Knopfler\, Joe Walsh\, Richa
 rd Thompson\, Jason Isbell\, and Billy Strings.\n\n\nRecorded in just fou
 r days\, Emmanuel’s latest album\, Living In The Light\, stands as the mo
 st daring—and most rewarding—collection in the globetrotting fingerpicker
 ’s remarkable catalog\, fusing his pop\, jazz\, classical\, and roots inf
 luences into a virtuosic masterwork as exhilarating as it is intimate.\n\
 n\n\n\nTrey Hensley:\n\n\nGRAMMY® winner and reigning two-time IBMA Guita
 r Player of the Year Trey Hensley has been called a “musical phenom” by N
 PR\, “a guitar-slinging superhero” by Bluegrass Today\, “Nashville’s hott
 est young player” by Acoustic Guitar magazine\, and “the Swiss Army knife
  of roots music” by WMOT Radio’s Craig Havighurst. Hensley’s artistry has
  received high praise from the likes of Merle Haggard and Marty Stuart. A
 n Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival invitee who has collaborated 
 with Johnny Cash\, Vince Gill\, Dolly Parton\, Taj Mahal and Tommy Emmanu
 el\, Hensley is known for his other-worldly guitar playing\, jaw-dropping
  musicianship and soulful storytelling. Having recently announced his sig
 nature guitar with Taylor Guitars\, The Trey Hensley Gold Label 510e. Hen
 sley is set to release a new album\, Can’t Outrun The Blues\, on March 6\
 , 2026. The title cut has spent multiple weeks at #1 on the bluegrass cha
 rts.\n\nSource: Bloomington Arts
