SUMMARY:Special Performance: Indonesian Shadow Puppetry (wayang kulit)
DESCRIPTION:Performances of "Suramaya" at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  This 30-minu
 te shadow puppet performance by Dr. Jennifer Goodlander tells the tale of
  a king who sends his servants into the forest to collect supplies for a 
 big party. The king of the forest\, Suramaya\, does not like his plan. Ex
 perience a dynamic story with an environmental message\, told with beauti
 ful animal puppets. Appropriate for all ages.About Dr. Jennifer Goodlande
 r  Jennifer Goodlander is an Associate Professor in the Dept. of Theatre\
 , Drama\, and Contemporary Dance and Director of the Southeast Asian and 
 ASEAN Studies Center. Jennifer has published numerous articles and two bo
 oks: Women in the Shadows: Gender\, Puppets\, and the Power of Tradition 
 in Bali (Ohio University Press\, 2016) and Puppets and Cities: Articulati
 ng Identities in Southeast Asia (Bloomsbury Methuen Drama\, 2018). Jennif
 er remains active as a director and has performed Balinese wayang kulit\,
  or shadow puppetry\, at international festivals and around the United St
 ates.Connections to Mulyana: Vital Ecosystems (https://artmuseum.indiana.
 edu/exhibitions/upcoming/_feature-exhibitions/2026-02-07-mulyana-vital-ec
 osystems.html)  Mulyana's community-engaged artmaking practice\, performa
 nces\, and immersive installations reinvent Indonesia's enduring traditio
 n of shadow puppetry (wayang kulit). Wayang combines engaging storytellin
 g\, music\, spirituality\, and a range of different characters. Alluding 
 to this theatrical apparatus\, Mulyana invents his own distinct octopus-m
 onster characters (Mogus) to populate his fantastical textile ecosystems.
  His dramatic use of light and shadow further evokes the atmospheric qual
 ity of shadow puppet performances. Consistent with this tradition\, Mulya
 na: Vital Ecosystems fosters community gathering and conveys a powerful m
 essage about social wellbeing.Know Before You Go:  This event is part of 
 the First Thursdays festivals showcase (https://artsandhumanities.indiana

SUMMARY:Burke Lecture Series: Dr. Kirsten Pai Buick
DESCRIPTION:In a cultural climate where we are being actively encouraged 
 to forget or mis-remember\, this lecture argues that forgetting can be co
 nstitutive of visuality itself‚Äîthat we must forget as the very conditio
 n of seeing. What does the slave narrative of James Williams (1838) mask\
 , for example? What of Edmonia Lewis's sculpture Forever Free (1867) or J
 ohn Gast's painting American Progress (1872)? Turning on the central ques
 tion of "who is responsible for remembering\," each work resists illegibi
 lity by withholding the unspeakable and the unspoken. &#160\;  Lecture wi
 ll be held until 5 pm followed by questions. Reception to follow.&#160\;S

SUMMARY:Burke Lecture Series: Dr. Sampada Aranke
DESCRIPTION:This talk will consider the ways that famed Black American co
 nceptual artist David Hammons cites\, leverages\, and operationalizes whi
 te\, western canons to probe the generative limits of art historical disc
 ourse and canonization. The artist's intentional engagement with the prac
 tices and legacies of artists whose oeuvres have formed an avant-garde we
 stern canon like Duchamp\, Klein\, Matta-Clark\, is not about mere adorat
 ion\, but in fact a strategic assessment\, if not deformation\, of art hi
 storical discourses. Operating like a trojan horse\, Hammons has seamless
 ly created opportunities for alignment and association\, making it so tha
 t named collectors of Duchamp and museums that collect Matta-Clark have i
 ncomplete collections if they do not own a work by Hammons. This project 
 will work alongside two key Hammons works\, The Holy Bible: Old Testament
  (2002) and Days End (2021) to consider how the artist breaks disciplinar
 y canons in order to make radically renewed associations.  &#160\;  Lectu
 re will be held until 5 pm followed by questions. Reception to follow.Spo
 nsored by the Robert E. &amp\; Avis Tarrant Burke Lecture Fund.
