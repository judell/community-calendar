DESCRIPTION:Creating your estate plan\, whether it’s a living trust or a
  will\, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are 
 difficult to think about\, such as death\, incapacity\, finances\, and fam

 ay weigh heavily on your mind. We invite you to attend one of our upcoming
  free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind 
 by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational webinar

  an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how wills and trus
 ts differ\, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avo
 id them. Our goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect
  yourself and your family\, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like
  to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further\, we of
