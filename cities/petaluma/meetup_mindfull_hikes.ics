SUMMARY:Olompali State Historic Park - Exploratory Hike
DESCRIPTION:Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a
  moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation cha
 nges.***\n\nThe park overlooks the Petaluma River and San Pablo Bay from t
 he east-facing slopes of 1\,558 foot Mount Burdell. The name "olompali" co
 mes from the Miwok language and may be translated as "southern village" or
  "southern people." The Coast Miwok inhabited at least one site within the
  area of the present-day park continuously from as early as 6\,000 BC\, un
 til the early 1850s.\n\n**Distance:** +/- 9 miles total\; out and back\n\n
 **The hike:**\nExploratory because I've not led this hike and it has been 
 many years since I hiked it. We'll start off on the Miwok Trail to Burdell
  Trail to the turn around point. At the peak of Mt Burdell we'll head back
  the way we came on Burdell Trail and then talke the Miwok loop trail to t
 he starting place.\n\n**Where to meet:** Parking lot of the park\n\n**Dire
 ctions:**\nThe park is accessible from both the Northbound and Southbound 
 lanes of Highway 101. Exit at Atherton Ave./San Marin Dr. and follow poste
 d directional signs to the park.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start prom
 ptly at the start time listed.* ***Give yourself a little extra time to ar
 rive*** and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as th
 is is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**Parking:**\nFree if you
  have a CA State Park pass.\nOR $10\, payable by cash\, check\, or via sma
 rtphone with QR code at the parking lot. If paying by cash\, look for the 
 yellow fee payment tube at the west end of the parking lot to deposit your
  payment.\n\n**Restroom**: Near the parking area\n\n**What to bring:** Lun
 ch\, water\, hat\, good hiking shoes\, a joyful spirit and laughter. Pleas
 e dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are alw
 ays advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nM
 indful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves
 \, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walki
 ng throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. The
 re will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other.
  These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfuln
 ess to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and ca
 meras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other\, o
 ur *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitl
 ist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days befor
 e the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute a
 nd it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of th
 e Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Ric
 k Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladden
 s the heart\, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into t
 he world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered**
  and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Ve
 nmo account is: @vickieix8\; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.
 \n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start o
 f the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change 
 and you're not coming\, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's mo
 re likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last mi
 nute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Member
 s with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.
