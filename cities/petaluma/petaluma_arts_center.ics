 ten Stain Nobuto Suga and Amy Rathbone Pierre Thiam Lena Wolff A multidisc
 iplinary group of artists were invited to generate new ideas in a creative
  ecosystem committed to cultivating curiosity. Opening during San Francisc
 o Art Week\, Crafting Curiosity celebrates not only what was made\, but al
 so how it was made: through individual exploration\, shared learning\, and
  a belief in the generative possibilities that arise when we work together
 . Thanks to a generous donation from Llisa Demetrios\, Chief Curator of th

 , and play are powerful tools for learning\, creating\, and positively sha
 ping the world around&nbsp\;us. The residency carries forward a&nbsp\;long
  tradition of&nbsp\;agriculture and making at the Eames Ranch\, shaped by 
 Lucia Eames and her daughter Llisa Demetrios\, both artists whose daily li

 pm On the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States \, Americ
 ana Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore
 \, reinterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of “Americana”. Thi
 s juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar symbols
 \, stories\, and styles evolve over time—bridging the past and present t
 hrough creativity and craft.&nbsp\; “Americana” has long served as a r
 eflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town iconography and h
 andmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. In Americana Reima
 gined artists reexamine this broad theme\, juxtaposing the old and the new
 \, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh perspectives on what 
 they mean today. Jurors&nbsp\; Donna Seager\, Donna Seager Fine Arts &amp\

 ion Dates: March 12 - April 18\, 2026 Opening Reception: Thursday\, March 
 12\, 5:30-7:30pm States of Anxiety\, States of Hope &nbsp\;presents a sele
 ction of works by artist Inez Storer that reflect on the emotional\, cultu
 ral\, and political complexities of contemporary life. Building on themes 
 explored in &nbsp\; Americana Reimagined \, &nbsp\;Storer’s paintings of
 fer a layered meditation on identity\, memory\, and collective experience 
 in times of uncertainty and transformation. Through her distinctive magica
 l realist collage method\, Storer constructs richly textured visual narrat
 ives that merge personal history with broader social realities. Her works 
 are composed of fragments—symbols\, images\, and artifacts drawn from he
 r life and interests. Storer's paintings guide the viewer on a journey thr
 ough both historical memory and internal landscapes. They balance darkness
  and light\, anxiety and hope.&nbsp\; She asks us to reflect on the condit
 ions of our moment. States of Anxiety\, States of Hope affirms art’s cap
 acity to illuminate struggle while nurturing resilience\, empathy\, and co
 nnection. Biography Storer lives in Inverness\, California\, and has a stu
 dio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic fat
 her and Jewish mother\, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her f
 ather worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design\, her work oft
 en creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Sh
 ortly before her death\, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to 
 escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertr
 ansport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work
  with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the
  Jewish Museum in New York\, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis\, Oak
 land Museum of Art \, the de Young Museum\, San José Museum of Art\, Mont
 erey Museum of Art\, Missoula Museum of Art\, National Museum of American 
 Jewish History\, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts\, Washington

 anion exhibition of Storer’s Works on Paper. Exhibition dates are March
