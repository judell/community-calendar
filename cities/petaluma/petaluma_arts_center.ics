  Agriculture and Making at the Eames Ranch Featuring work from the inaugur
 al Ranch Studios Artist Residency\, created at the Eames Ranch in Petaluma
 \, CA. Over two three-month sessions\, a small group of artists transforme
 d the Ranch’s barn and farmstead buildings into studios for experimentat
 ion\, discovery\, and play.&nbsp\; Artists include:&nbsp\; Windy Chien Rie
  and Jay Dion Chris Kallmyer Travis Meinolf Masako Miki Yvonne Mouser Kris
 ten Stain Nobuto Suga and Amy Rathbone Pierre Thiam Lena Wolff A multidisc
 iplinary group of artists were invited to generate new ideas in a creative
  ecosystem committed to cultivating curiosity. Opening during San Francisc
 o Art Week\, Crafting Curiosity celebrates not only what was made\, but al
 so how it was made: through individual exploration\, shared learning\, and
  a belief in the generative possibilities that arise when we work together
 . Thanks to a generous donation from Llisa Demetrios\, Chief Curator of th
 e Eames Institute\, admission during the entire show will be free! (SEE BE

  Charles Eames\, whose legacy demonstrates that inquiry\, problem-solving\
 , and play are powerful tools for learning\, creating\, and positively sha
 ping the world around&nbsp\;us. The residency carries forward a&nbsp\;long
  tradition of&nbsp\;agriculture and making at the Eames Ranch\, shaped by 
 Lucia Eames and her daughter Llisa Demetrios\, both artists whose daily li

 t of Petaluma Arts Center's exhibition "Crafting Curiosity: Advancing a Le
 gacy of Agriculture and Making at the Eames Ranch\," Bay Area artist and c
 raftswoman Lena Wolf leads a workshop exploring natural ink and paint maki
 ng. Uniquely different from working with stable store-bought art materials
 \, making handmade color is dynamic and surprising\, offering an environme
 ntally sound approach to artmaking while also forming a deeper connection 
 to place. During the class\, Lena will share about her experience generati
 ng colors with plants and fungi during her residency at the Eames Ranch an
 d relay the fundamentals of the process: from foraging and gathering\, to 
 extracting color into paint. Participants will create several color charts
  as well as learn how to adjust hues with a variety of additives\, documen
 ting the process along the way and taking recipes home for future experime
 ntation. As a longtime teacher of color theory\, Lena will weave broader c
 ontext into the workshop\, sharing a brief history of paint-making and the
  phenomenon behind our perception of colors in interaction\, looking at th
 e subject through multiple lenses of art\, craft\, science\, design and en
 vironmentalism. All materials will be supplied and are included in the wor
 kshop fee. THIS WORKSHOP IS SOLD OUT Please note that photography and vide

 ana Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore
 \, reinterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of “Americana”. Thi
 s juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar symbols
 \, stories\, and styles evolve over time—bridging the past and present t
 hrough creativity and craft.&nbsp\; “Americana” has long served as a r
 eflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town iconography and h
 andmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. In Americana Reima

 \, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh perspectives on what 
 they mean today. Jurors&nbsp\; Donna Seager\, Donna Seager Fine Arts &amp\

 12\, 5:30-7:30pm States of Anxiety\, States of Hope &nbsp\;presents a sele
 ction of works by artist Inez Storer that reflect on the emotional\, cultu
 ral\, and political complexities of contemporary life. Building on themes 
 explored in &nbsp\; Americana Reimagined \, &nbsp\;Storer’s paintings of
 fer a layered meditation on identity\, memory\, and collective experience 
 in times of uncertainty and transformation. Through her distinctive magica
 l realist collage method\, Storer constructs richly textured visual narrat
 ives that merge personal history with broader social realities. Her works 
 are composed of fragments—symbols\, images\, and artifacts drawn from he
 r life and interests. Storer's paintings guide the viewer on a journey thr
 ough both historical memory and internal landscapes. They balance darkness
  and light\, anxiety and hope.&nbsp\; She asks us to reflect on the condit
 ions of our moment. States of Anxiety\, States of Hope affirms art’s cap
 acity to illuminate struggle while nurturing resilience\, empathy\, and co
 nnection. Biography Storer lives in Inverness\, California\, and has a stu
 dio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic fat
 her and Jewish mother\, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her f
 ather worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design\, her work oft
 en creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Sh
 ortly before her death\, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to 
 escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertr
 ansport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work
  with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the
  Jewish Museum in New York\, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis\, Oak
 land Museum of Art \, the de Young Museum\, San José Museum of Art\, Mont
 erey Museum of Art\, Missoula Museum of Art\, and the National Museum of A
 merican Jewish History. At the same time\, our friends at IceHouse Gallery
  will hold a companion exhibition of Storer’s Works on Paper. Exhibition
