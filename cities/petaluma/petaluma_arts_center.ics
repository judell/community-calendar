 al Ranch Studios Artist Residency\, created at the Eames Ranch in Petaluma
 \, CA. Over two three-month sessions\, a small group of artists transforme
 d the Ranch’s barn and farmstead buildings into studios for experimentat
 ion\, discovery\, and play.&nbsp\; Artists include:&nbsp\; Windy Chien Rie
  and Jay Dion Chris Kallmyer Travis Meinolf Masako Miki Yvonne Mouser Kris
 ten Stain Nobuto Suga and Amy Rathbone Pierre Thiam Lena Wolff A multidisc
 iplinary group of artists were invited to generate new ideas in a creative
  ecosystem committed to cultivating curiosity. Opening during San Francisc
 o Art Week\, Crafting Curiosity celebrates not only what was made\, but al
 so how it was made: through individual exploration\, shared learning\, and
  a belief in the generative possibilities that arise when we work together
 . Thanks to a generous donation from Llisa Demetrios\, Chief Curator of th
 e Eames Institute\, admission during the entire show will be free! (SEE BE

  tradition of&nbsp\;agriculture and making at the Eames Ranch\, shaped by 
 Lucia Eames and her daughter Llisa Demetrios\, both artists whose daily li

 tory of Place\, with Eames Ranch Studios Artist Resident Lena Wolff As par
 t of Petaluma Arts Center's exhibition "Crafting Curiosity: Advancing a Le
 gacy of Agriculture and Making at the Eames Ranch\," Bay Area artist and c
 raftswoman Lena Wolf leads a workshop exploring natural ink and paint maki
 ng. Uniquely different from working with stable store-bought art materials
 \, making handmade color is dynamic and surprising\, offering an environme
 ntally sound approach to artmaking while also forming a deeper connection 
 to place. During the class\, Lena will share about her experience generati
 ng colors with plants and fungi during her residency at the Eames Ranch an
 d relay the fundamentals of the process: from foraging and gathering\, to 
 extracting color into paint. Participants will create several color charts
  as well as learn how to adjust hues with a variety of additives\, documen
 ting the process along the way and taking recipes home for future experime
 ntation. As a longtime teacher of color theory\, Lena will weave broader c
 ontext into the workshop\, sharing a brief history of paint-making and the
  phenomenon behind our perception of colors in interaction\, looking at th
 e subject through multiple lenses of art\, craft\, science\, design and en
 vironmentalism. All materials will be supplied and are included in the wor
 kshop fee. THIS WORKSHOP IS SOLD OUT Please note that photography and vide

 ana Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore
 \, reinterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of “Americana”. Thi
 s juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar symbols
 \, stories\, and styles evolve over time—bridging the past and present t
 hrough creativity and craft.&nbsp\; “Americana” has long served as a r
 eflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town iconography and h
 andmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. In Americana Reima

 \, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh perspectives on what 
 they mean today. Jurors&nbsp\; Donna Seager\, Donna Seager Fine Arts &amp\

DESCRIPTION:In Conversation with Inez Storer Sunday\, April 12\, 4:00-5:00
 pm $15 members\; $20 non-members An afternoon conversation about Inez’s 
 approach to artmaking\, her family history and the stories that inform her
  art. There will be time for questions. Storer lives in Inverness\, Califo
 rnia\, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 19
 33 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother\, she spent time on Hollywood mo
 vie sets where her father worked as an art director. Influenced by stage d
 esign\, her work often creates a sense of “theatrical space” and refle
 cts her ancestry. Shortly before her death\, her mother revealed that she 
 had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who esc
 aped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of being kept from the truth 
 has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many colle
 ctions including the Jewish Museum in New York\, Manetti Shrem Museum of A
 rt at UC Davis\, Oakland Museum of Art \, the de Young Museum\, San José 
 Museum of Art\, Monterey Museum of Art\, Missoula Museum of Art\, and the 
 National Museum of American Jewish History. Get tickets #block-1561e173823
