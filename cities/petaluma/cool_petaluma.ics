 ul Hawken looks at the flow of life through the lens of carbon. Embracing 
 a panoramic view of carbon’s omnipresence\, he explores how this ubiquit
 ous and essential element extends into every aperture of existence and sha
 pes the entire fabric of life. Hawken charts a course across our planetary
  history\, guiding us into the realms of plants\, animals\, insects\, fung
 i\, food\, and farms to offer a new narrative for embracing carbon’s lif
 e-giving power and its possibilities for the future of human endeavor. Haw
 ken illuminates the subtle connections between carbon and our collective h
 uman experience and asks us to see nature\, carbon\, and ourselves as exqu
 isitely intertwined—inseparably connected. &nbsp\; [ { "id": "04388466-7
