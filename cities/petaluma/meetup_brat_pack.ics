SUMMARY:Russian River Fungi Fest in Guerneville
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack\nLet's meet in downtown Guerneville on 
 Saturday\, Feb. 21st at 12pm to learn more about mushrooms (tasty gourmet 
 ones\, not the "magic" kind) while socializing at the same time.\n\nYou do
 n't actually need a ticket to attend\, but they do offer them on Eventbrit
 e for a $15 suggested donation to help defray costs of getting it up and r
 unning. Hopefully weather will be on our side for this one! I think most o
 f the events will be outside. They will have live music\, a mushroom marke
 t\, workshops and more. Restaurants will offer special mushroom-themed men
 us. Solar Punk Farms and the Russian River Chamber of Commerce are organiz
 ing the event.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://www.solarpunkfarms.com/fungi
 fest\n\nAny questions\, just message DJ through Meetup. The event actually
  runs from 10am-6pm on both Feb. 21st and 22nd\, but we'll just be there f
 or about 3 hours on Saturday the 21st\, unless anyone wants to stay longer
 . We'll pick a good meeting place as soon as they release more details.
