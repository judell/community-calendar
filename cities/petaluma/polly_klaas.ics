SUMMARY:West Side Stories Petaluma: Don't Give Up Your Day Job
DESCRIPTION:West Side Stories at PKCT! \nEveryone has a story and now it’s your chance to tell it. Every month there is a theme\, hopefully that sparks a memory for you. You put your name in a hat (an actual hat!) and 10 people’s names are drawn at random. When your name is pulled you get 5 minutes to tell your personal true story. At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you\, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun\, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>
