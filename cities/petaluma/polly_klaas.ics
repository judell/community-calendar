SUMMARY:The Jungle Book - By Missoula Children's Theater - 2/28 @ 2pm
DESCRIPTION:PKF & PKCT in association with Missoula Children’s Theater present:\nTHE JUNGLE BOOK\nAdapted by Michael McGill \nMusic and Lyrics by Michael McGill \nEver been abandoned in the jungle\, adopted by wolves\, taught by a bear\, befriended by a panther and chased by a tiger? In the Missoula Children’s Theatre musical adaptation of THE JUNGLE BOOK\, Mowgli the man-cub has all these adventures and more. Join him as he escapes from the Bander-log\, outwits a tiger\, enlists the help of a rock-python\, explores what it means to be human and learns a lesson from the brave mongoose Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Original music and rollicking humor give new life to the classic tale by Rudyard Kipling. \nThree shows are scheduled: 2/27 at 7pm and 2/28 at 2pm and 5:30pm. Get your tickets now to see local kids put on an amazing performance of this classic; all auditioned\, rehearsed\, produced\, and presented in just one week! \nCelebrating over 50 years of touring\, the Missoula Children’s Theatre International Tour has fostered developmental life skills in more than a million kids. Our tour reaches 65\,000 children in more than 1\,000 communities in all 50 states and 15+ countries each year. One of the many ways the Missoula Children’s Theatre remains vibrant is through generous donors all over the world.

If that’s you\, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun\, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>
