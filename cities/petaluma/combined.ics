 tory of Place\, with Eames Ranch Studios Artist Resident Lena Wolff As par
 t of Petaluma Arts Center's exhibition "Crafting Curiosity: Advancing a Le
 gacy of Agriculture and Making at the Eames Ranch\," Bay Area artist and c
 raftswoman Lena Wolf leads a workshop exploring natural ink and paint maki
 ng. Uniquely different from working with stable store-bought art materials
 \, making handmade color is dynamic and surprising\, offering an environme
 ntally sound approach to artmaking while also forming a deeper connection 
 to place. During the class\, Lena will share about her experience generati
 ng colors with plants and fungi during her residency at the Eames Ranch an
 d relay the fundamentals of the process: from foraging and gathering\, to 
 extracting color into paint. Participants will create several color charts
  as well as learn how to adjust hues with a variety of additives\, documen
 ting the process along the way and taking recipes home for future experime
 ntation. As a longtime teacher of color theory\, Lena will weave broader c
 ontext into the workshop\, sharing a brief history of paint-making and the
  phenomenon behind our perception of colors in interaction\, looking at th
 e subject through multiple lenses of art\, craft\, science\, design and en
 vironmentalism. All materials will be supplied and are included in the wor
 kshop fee. THIS WORKSHOP IS SOLD OUT Please note that photography and vide
 o recording may take place during this event. By participating\, you grant

 he east-facing slopes of 1\,558 foot Mount Burdell. The name "olompali" co
 mes from the Miwok language and may be translated as "southern village" or
  "southern people." The Coast Miwok inhabited at least one site within the
  area of the present-day park continuously from as early as 6\,000 BC\, un
 til the early 1850s.\n\n**Distance:** +/- 9 miles total\; out and back\n\n
 **The hike:**\nExploratory because I've not led this hike and it has been 
 many years since I hiked it. We'll start off on the Miwok Trail to Burdell
  Trail to the turn around point. At the peak of Mt Burdell we'll head back
  the way we came on Burdell Trail and then talke the Miwok loop trail to t
 he starting place.\n\n**Where to meet:** Parking lot of the park\n\n**Dire
 ctions:**\nThe park is accessible from both the Northbound and Southbound 
 lanes of Highway 101. Exit at Atherton Ave./San Marin Dr. and follow poste
 d directional signs to the park.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start prom
 ptly at the start time listed.* ***Give yourself a little extra time to ar
 rive*** and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as th
 is is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**Parking:**\nFree if you
  have a CA State Park pass.\nOR $10\, payable by cash\, check\, or via sma
 rtphone with QR code at the parking lot. If paying by cash\, look for the 
 yellow fee payment tube at the west end of the parking lot to deposit your
  payment.\n\n**Restroom**: Near the parking area\n\n**What to bring:** Lun
 ch\, water\, hat\, good hiking shoes\, a joyful spirit and laughter. Pleas
 e dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are alw
 ays advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nM
 indful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves
 \, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walki
 ng throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. The
 re will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other.
  These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfuln
 ess to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and ca
 meras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other\, o
 ur *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitl
 ist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days befor
 e the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute a
 nd it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of th
 e Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Ric
 k Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladden
 s the heart\, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into t
 he world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered**
  and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Ve
 nmo account is: @vickieix8\; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.
 \n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start o
 f the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change 
 and you're not coming\, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's mo
 re likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last mi
 nute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Member
 s with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.\n\nSource: Meetup Mindfull Hikes

 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might

SUMMARY:Tomales Point Trail - Pt Reyes
DESCRIPTION:Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a
  moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation cha
 nges.***\n\n**The hike:** Join me for a hike at Tomales Point\, the northe
 rn end of Point Reyes National Seashore. The Tomales Point Trail is popula
 r for viewing Tule elk\, birds and wildflowers in season. The out and back
  hike leads along the ridge crest of a narrow peninsula\, offering spectac
 ular views of Tomales Bay and Bolinas Ridge to the east\, Bodega Bay to th
 e north\, and the coastline of the Point Reyes peninsula stretching to the
  south - when it's not fogged in.\n\n**Trail:** Tomales Point Trail\n**Dis
 tance:** +/- 9.5 miles round trip\n\n**How to get there:**\nFrom Petaluma 
 take D Street/ turns into Pt Reyes Petaluma Rd. At Pt Reyes Station turn r
 ight Immediately after crossing the bridge on to Sir Francis Drake Blvd. A
 fter passing thru Inverness **\\*Pay Attention\\*** and turn right on Pier
 ce Point Road. Travel past Abbotts Lagoon and Kehoe Beach. Keep going unti
 l you reach Pierce Point Ranch.\n\n**Parking:** Free at Pierce Point Ranch
 \n\nClosest restroom is at McClure's Beach .4 miles before the trailhead.\
 n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* G
 ive yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situated so that you’
 re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time tog
 ether.\n\n**What to bring:** Lunch\, water\, hat\, good hiking shoes\, a j
 oyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that
  day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**========================
 ===========**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to c
 onnect more fully with ourselves\, each other and with the land. There wil
 l be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses
  to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to vi
 sit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are
  an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time t
 o put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be f
 ully present with each other\, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.
 ***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please
  message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have peop
 le drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n
 \n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are off
 ered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful
  practice that opens and gladdens the heart\, relaxes the contraction of 
 ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dā
 na practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo o
 r cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8\; last four di
 gits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at 
 least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be 
 a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming\, opening up a spot
  4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend 
 than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you 
 cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the gr
 oup.\n\nSource: Meetup Mindfull Hikes

SUMMARY:Russian River Fungi Fest in Guerneville
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack\nLet's meet in downtown Guerneville on 
 Saturday\, Feb. 21st at 12pm to learn more about mushrooms (tasty gourmet 
 ones\, not the "magic" kind) while socializing at the same time.\n\nYou do
 n't actually need a ticket to attend\, but they do offer them on Eventbrit
 e for a $15 suggested donation to help defray costs of getting it up and r
 unning. Hopefully weather will be on our side for this one! I think most o
 f the events will be outside. They will have live music\, a mushroom marke
 t\, workshops and more. Restaurants will offer special mushroom-themed men
 us. Solar Punk Farms and the Russian River Chamber of Commerce are organiz
 ing the event.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://www.solarpunkfarms.com/fungi
 fest\n\nAny questions\, just message DJ through Meetup. The event actually
  runs from 10am-6pm on both Feb. 21st and 22nd\, but we'll just be there f
 or about 3 hours on Saturday the 21st\, unless anyone wants to stay longer
 . We'll pick a good meeting place as soon as they release more details.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack

SUMMARY:English Country Dance Napa
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon
 g lines (like contra)\, circles\, or in geometric sets (squares\, triangle
 s). Like our contra dances\, there is live music and a caller. You can com
 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each m
 onth\, 2-4:30 pm\, to live music\, all levels of experience welcome\; and 
 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members 
 of NBCDS and its affiliates\, $8 for young adults ages 19-30\, and $3 for 
 youth ages 6 – 18.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow

 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R

 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w

SUMMARY: Free Estate Planning Webinar

 s and trusts differ\, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and
  how to avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you 
 need to protect yourself and your family\, and leave a legacy of peace. I
 f you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning need
 s further\, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free\, n
 o obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this 
 webinar\, we will discuss several common issues and concerns\, including:
 \n\n  * The advantages and disadvantages of wills\, living trusts\, and p
 robate\n  * Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-s
 pouses\, lawsuits\, and other claims\n  * Most living trusts fail\; if yo
 u already have a trust\, find out what you can do to ensure that it will 
 protect you and your loved ones\n  * How to preserve your nest egg for yo
 ur family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n  * How to stay ou
 t of court and avoid the cost\, time\, and stress that a conservatorship 
 can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a 
 FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions 
 about setting up your estate plan ($425 value).\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association

SUMMARY:Afternoon Hike at Annadel - Parktrail
DESCRIPTION:Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a
  moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation cha
 nges.***\n\nCelebrating the end of the day with a hike to Lake Ilsanjo.\n\
 n**Distance:** +/- 5 miles total\n**The hike:** A lollipop hike that inclu
 des Canyon\, Lake (around the lake) and Spring Trails. There are some hill
 s to climb on this hike.\n\n**Parking:** Street parking on Parktrail Drive
 \n\n**Where to Meet:** Intersection of Parktrail Drive and Comfrey Place o
 n the sidewalk.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start
  time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situate
 d so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part
  of our time together.\n\n**What to bring:** Snack\, water\, hat\, good hi
 king shoes\, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for 
 the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**========
 ===========================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended 
 to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves\, each other and with the
  land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to 
 allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time durin
 g the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking an
 d connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment.
  **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from te
 chnology to be fully present with each other\, our *senses and the land we
  are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want 
 to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most
  hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is 
 an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindf
 ul hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosit
 y is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart\, relaxes the 
 contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many peo
 ple.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of gene
 rosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8
 \; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Pl
 ease cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful tha
 t there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming\, op
 ening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be 
 able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a 
 no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are remo
 ved from the group.\n\nSource: Meetup Mindfull Hikes

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:XO Chips XO\, Halou and Identical Homes
DESCRIPTION:Petaluma’s own Xo Chips Xo makes tightly constructed electronic music that leans toward 80s minimal pop—crisp beats\, angular bass/synth lines\, balancing precision with a dry\, playful edge. \nHalou is the long-running project of Ryan and Rebecca Coseboom who quietly built a deeply devoted audience by writing music that feels like an internal conversation. Their sound blends dream-pop\, electronic atmospheres\, and intimate songwriting that has resonated far beyond expectations.  \nIdentical Homes is the experimental project of California-based musician and producer Daniel McKenzie\, known for his work in bands like The Rum Diary\, Built for the Sea\, and Shuteye Unison. With Identical Homes\, he creates a deeply atmospheric and exploratory sonic world\, blending elements of ambient\, post-rock\, electronic\, and art-pop. Live\, Daniel is joined by Jake Krohn (Shuteye Unison\, The Action Design)\, Lia Rose (Built for the Sea)\, and Greg Kelly (Sunset Junior\, Fight Like Fight). Together\, they trade instruments often\, weaving between ambient interludes\, tribal rhythms\, and dreamy pop choruses.\n\nSource: The Big Easy

  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each m
 onth\, 2-4:30 pm\, to live music\, all levels of experience welcome\; and 
 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members 
 of NBCDS and its affiliates\, $8 for young adults ages 19-30\, and $3 for 
 youth ages 6 – 18.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

SUMMARY:Petaluma Contra Dance
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nContra Dance is fun\, quick to learn\,
  and great exercise. Every dance night has a live band\, caller\, and a qu
 ick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance\, you will dance with y
 our partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The
  figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk
  through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we 
 encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comf
 ortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\n
 When to arrive: If this is your first time\, come 30 minutes early to chec
 k in\, join the quick start class\, and get you ready for the first dance.
 \nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing ri
 ght away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group\, couple\, or s
 ingle! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: $13 members\
 , $15 non-members\, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu

 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side

 ul Hawken looks at the flow of life through the lens of carbon. Embracing 
 a panoramic view of carbon’s omnipresence\, he explores how this ubiquit

  history\, guiding us into the realms of plants\, animals\, insects\, fung
 i\, food\, and farms to offer a new narrative for embracing carbon’s lif
 e-giving power and its possibilities for the future of human endeavor. Haw
 ken illuminates the subtle connections between carbon and our collective h

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors

SUMMARY:West Side Stories Petaluma: Don't Give Up Your Day Job
DESCRIPTION:West Side Stories at PKCT! \nEveryone has a story and now it’s your chance to tell it. Every month there is a theme\, hopefully that sparks a memory for you. You put your name in a hat (an actual hat!) and 10 people’s names are drawn at random. When your name is pulled you get 5 minutes to tell your personal true story. At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you\, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun\, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>\n\nSource: Polly Klaas Community Theater

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

 pm On the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States \, Americ
 ana Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore
 \, reinterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of “Americana”. Thi
 s juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar symbols
 \, stories\, and styles evolve over time—bridging the past and present t
 hrough creativity and craft.&nbsp\; “Americana” has long served as a r
 eflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town iconography and h
 andmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. In Americana Reima
 gined artists reexamine this broad theme\, juxtaposing the old and the new
 \, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh perspectives on what 
 they mean today. Jurors&nbsp\; Donna Seager\, Donna Seager Fine Arts &amp\

 fer a layered meditation on identity\, memory\, and collective experience 
 in times of uncertainty and transformation. Through her distinctive magica

 are composed of fragments—symbols\, images\, and artifacts drawn from he

 nnection. Biography Storer lives in Inverness\, California\, and has a stu
 dio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic fat
 her and Jewish mother\, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her f
 ather worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design\, her work oft
 en creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Sh
 ortly before her death\, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to 
 escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertr
 ansport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work
  with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the
  Jewish Museum in New York\, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis\, Oak
 land Museum of Art \, the de Young Museum\, San José Museum of Art\, Mont
 erey Museum of Art\, Missoula Museum of Art\, and the National Museum of A
 merican Jewish History. At the same time\, our friends at IceHouse Gallery
  will hold a companion exhibition of Storer’s Works on Paper. Exhibition
  dates are March 7 - March 28. [ { "type": "highlight"\, "id": "b4413bba-8

  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nAdmission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affil

SUMMARY:San Rafael Contra Dance
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nContra Dance is fun\, quick to learn\,
  and great exercise. Every dance night has a live band\, caller\, and a qu

 our partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The
  figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk

 encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comf
 ortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\n
 When to arrive: If this is your first time\, come 30 minutes early to chec
 k in\, join the quick start class\, and get you ready for the first dance.
 \nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing ri
 ght away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group\, couple\, or s
 ingle! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: *Free to fir
 st-time dancers*. $13 members\, $15 non-members\, $8 student or limited in

SUMMARY:English Country Dance Sebastopol
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon
 g lines (like contra)\, circles\, or in geometric sets (squares\, triangle
 s). Like our contra dances\, there is live music and a caller. You can com
 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each m
 onth\, 2-4:30 pm\, to live music\, all levels of experience welcome\; and 
 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members 
 of NBCDS and its affiliates\, $8 for young adults ages 19-30\, and $3 for 
 youth ages 6 – 18.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

DESCRIPTION:Men of Worth Monday March 16 at 6:30pm A night of celtic folk 
 music with Men of Worth. In 1986\, Scotsman Donnie Macdonald and Irishman 
 James Keigher came together to perform Irish and Scottish folk music\, com
 bining traditional and contemporary styles. The name "Men of Worth" was ch
 osen from the title of a folk song written by the Scottish singer/songwrit
 er Archie Fisher. Together Men of Worth blend their voices with harmony an
 d support their collection of songs with their varied selection of instrum
 ents. They have a very simple approach to their presentation\, and in keep
 ing with tradition\, remain true to the music and story. Their show is a u
 nique combination of humour\, exciting tunes\, and soulful\, heartfelt bal
 lads. Men of Worth are an international act\, and have earned much respect
  and success in over thirty years of touring together. Performing concerts
  and festivals\, with twelve albums to their credit\; Men of Worth continu
 e the very tradition from which they've evolved.\n\nSource: Mercury Theate

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors

 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each m
 onth\, 2-4:30 pm\, to live music\, all levels of experience welcome\; and 
 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:West Side Stories Petaluma: Too Many Irons In The Fire
DESCRIPTION:West Side Stories at PKCT! \nEveryone has a story and now it’s your chance to tell it. Every month there is a theme\, hopefully that sparks a memory for you. You put your name in a hat (an actual hat!) and 10 people’s names are drawn at random. When your name is pulled you get 5 minutes to tell your personal true story. At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you\, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun\, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>\n\nSource: Polly Klaas Community Theater

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

DESCRIPTION:In Conversation with Inez Storer Sunday\, April 12\, 4:00-5:00
 pm $15 members\; $20 non-members An afternoon conversation about Inez’s 
 approach to artmaking\, her family history and the stories that inform her
  art. There will be time for questions. Storer lives in Inverness\, Califo
 rnia\, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 19
 33 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother\, she spent time on Hollywood mo
 vie sets where her father worked as an art director. Influenced by stage d
 esign\, her work often creates a sense of “theatrical space” and refle
 cts her ancestry. Shortly before her death\, her mother revealed that she 
 had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who esc
 aped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of being kept from the truth 
 has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many colle
 ctions including the Jewish Museum in New York\, Manetti Shrem Museum of A
 rt at UC Davis\, Oakland Museum of Art \, the de Young Museum\, San José 
 Museum of Art\, Monterey Museum of Art\, Missoula Museum of Art\, and the 
 National Museum of American Jewish History. Get tickets #block-1561e173823

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

 n11:30am - 1:30pm at River Plaza Shopping Center\n\nSanta and Mrs. Claus 
 are coming to town on November 28\, the Saturday after Thanksgiving!\n\nW
 hen Santa arrives in Petaluma\, he leaves his sleigh at home. Instead\, h

 luma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Cent

 30 am\, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa an

  “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parkin
 g lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be av
 ailable for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\n
 Santa would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma\, but in order to hea
 r from all the good boys and girls all over the world\, he will have to b
 e on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun sto
 p there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag
  and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local s
 hopping. When we all shop small\, it's not just for the things we love\, 
 but for the businesses we love\, for the community we call home\, and to 
 help promote local economic growth. Learn more about Small Business Satur
