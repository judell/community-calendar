 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta
 edtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip
  and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Membershi
 ps and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase 
 over $40. Materials fees are not discounted.\n\nBecome a member today and 
 find community\, connection\, and creativity.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 l run February 26-28 2026\, 4:00 pm Thursday through 3:00 pm Saturday.\n\n
 Escalating political conflict\, a polarized economy\, ongoing warfare\, an
 d climate anxieties give us plenty of occasion to come face to face with o
 ur fears. We may have to dig deeper for hope these days\, but we know wher
 e to find it. In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how "Be not afr
 aid" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation\, and ho
 w even in the midst of troubles\, both public and personal\, we can help e
 ach other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both o
 ur own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will 
 focus on experiences of fear\, courage\, consolation\, and resilience in t
 he historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nM
 arilyn McEntyre\, writer and longtime professor of literature\, coaches wr
 iters and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley\, Western Theologica
 l Seminary and the Oblate School of Theology. Her books include Caring for
  Words in a Culture of Lies\, When Poets Pray\, and Speaking Peace in a Cl

SUMMARY:Afternoon Hike at Annadel - Parktrail
DESCRIPTION:Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a
  moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation cha
 nges.***\n\nCelebrating the end of the day with a hike to Lake Ilsanjo.\n\
 n**Distance:** +/- 5 miles total\n**The hike:** A lollipop hike that inclu
 des Canyon\, Lake (around the lake) and Spring Trails. There are some hill
 s to climb on this hike.\n\n**Parking:** Street parking on Parktrail Drive
 \n\n**Where to Meet:** Intersection of Parktrail Drive and Comfrey Place o
 n the sidewalk.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start
  time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situate
 d so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part
  of our time together.\n\n**What to bring:** Snack\, water\, hat\, good hi
 king shoes\, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for 
 the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**========
 ===========================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended 
 to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves\, each other and with the
  land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to 
 allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time durin
 g the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking an
 d connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment.
  **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from te
 chnology to be fully present with each other\, our *senses and the land we
  are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want 
 to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most
  hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is 
 an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindf
 ul hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosit
 y is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart\, relaxes the 
 contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many peo
 ple.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of gene
 rosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8
 \; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Pl
 ease cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful tha
 t there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming\, op
 ening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be 
 able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a 
 no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are remo
 ved from the group.

 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t

 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot

 n of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale
  sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally\, her piece "Brave Little
  Hunter" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island\, highlighting

  also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in Oc

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books and Read On Sonoma are honored
  to welcome literacy advocate and motivational speaker Oliver James for th
 e launch of his powerful new memoir - Unread: A Memoir of Learning \\(and 
 Loving\\) to Read on TikTok! Oliver will be joined in conversation by belo
 ved friend and local librarian\, Mychal Threets. Join us for an unforgetta
 ble evening of literary insight followed by an audience Q&A and book signi
 ng with photo opportunities. All event proceeds will be donated to local n
 on-profit and vital literacy initiative\,  Read On Sonoma . This is a free
  event\, registration required due to limited seating. Honest and thought-
 provoking\, Unread is an inspiring\, hopeful memoir of growth and change -
  Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational n
 eglect\, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approxi
 mately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However\, at age 32\,
  with big dreams and few tools to actualize them\, he dedicated himself to
  learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliv
 er has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documen
 ted his decision to learn to read as an adult\, and his struggles and triu
 mphs along the way. Here\, he tells the full story behind his journey for 
 the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his exper
 ience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us ho
 w to be better\, more empathetic people. In just 365 days\, Oliver went fr
 om barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal o
 f finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us 
 that words and stories have power\, and that\, no matter our past\, it's n
 ever too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal
  trainer\, motivational speaker\, literacy activist\, and influencer. He h
 as been featured in or on Today\, NPR\, Jennifer Hudson Show\, Los Angeles
  Times\, Newsweek\, Rachael Ray\, and ABC News\, among many others. Additi
 onally\, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Lite
 racy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa\, California. Mychal Threets is a libra
 rian\, literary ambassador\, and the library's number one fan \\(according
  to himself\, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-
 school kid and grew up in Fairfield\, CA\, right between Sacramento and Sa
 n Francisco. Online\, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people th
 at their mental health always matters\, and he encourages everyone to know
  they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself\, Mychal is proud to
  serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/
 26\\) is his first book. His cats\, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barl
 ow\, did not help at all\, but he still appreciates them. Read On Sonoma a
  dedicated group of professionals\, educators and volunteers promoting lit
 eracy within our elementary schools. Donate directly\, meet the Executive 
 team\, and learn more about the tremendous work that they do by joining us
  that evening. For more information\, please visit their  website . Praise
 : "Unread feels like both story and concordance\, a good read and a great 
 resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But 
 mostly\, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in o
 rder to enunciate resilience\, one must learn the phonetics of desire\, su
 rvival\, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel." -Jason Reynolds\, New Yor
 k Times bestselling author of the Track series "An inspiring and deeply hu
 man story about resilience\, courage\, and the transformative power of lit
 eracy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey\, shared with millions onl
 ine\, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He
  not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late
  to learn\, to dream\, and to rewrite your own story." -Andrew Roberts\, P
 resident\, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy "Oliver James is a 
 big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave
 \, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . 
 He's the living\, breathing\, thriving example of what reading can do for 
 a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel\, there a
 re quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he 
 went through-but if their parents\, educators\, and leaders would read thi
 s memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them\, to
 o. This raw\, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has be
 en through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth
 ." -I. C. Robledo\, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By "Unread isn'
 t just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of ou
 r own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to 
 the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver J
 ames is a role model for us all." -Kelley Coleman\, author of Everything N
 o One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child "A thoughtful and inspiri
 ng story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading help
 s to change lives." -Kirkus

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:Bluegrass\, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding
  musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm\, Joh
 n Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seam
 lessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time m
 usic for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year\, with seven ac
 claimed albums and two Juno nominations\, the Jaybirds are simultaneously 
 innovative and unadorned\, sophisticated and stripped-down\, happily old-f
 ashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance\, $40 at 
 the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelcha
 ir accessible. Art gallery open during intermission\, refreshments for sal

 d's undisputed masters" of the mandolin\, famed for outstanding tone and t
 aste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular fav
 ourites for sessions and covers\, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He 
 has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded o
 n many other projects\, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The 
 Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music wit
 h highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller\; t
 he duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San 
 Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bl
 uegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary "new acoustic" qu
 artet\, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit\, renowned for highly skilled i
 nstrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed
  the Jaybirds. Of their latest album\, Folk Radio UK said "On That Other G
 reen Shore showcases an accomplished\, experienced band at the peak of the
 ir powers\, with musicianship of the very highest order." Peghead Nation c
 alled it "one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017." 
 Los Angeles\, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 201
 7. The veteran performer has played with\, among others\, Doc Watson\, Ric
 hard Greene\, John Jorgensen\, Peter Rowan\, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty.
  He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions
  by Laurie Lewis\, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher
  Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Day
 lighting the Creek as "a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the g
 lory days of early bluegrass guitar." Chilliwack\, BC-based Trisha Gagnon 
 is portrayed by Sing Out! as "one of the most versatile" and "irresistible
 " lead vocalists in bluegrass\, her strong and distinctive style ranging f
 rom "mournful and plaintive" to "hopeful and yearning." Trisha anchors wha
 t Dirty Linen magazine calls "gorgeous three-part harmonies." She's also k
 nown for songwriting\, dating back to her early days with the award-winnin
 g B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gil
 l and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo\, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his ow
 n voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contempo
 rary banjo players. "Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingli
 ng\," said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\)\, was nom
 inated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015\, and Nick is a composer wh

DESCRIPTION:Water Tower is the current moniker of multi-instrumentalist Ke
 nny Feinstein’s musical brainchild\, originally founded in 2005 in Portl
 and. While their lineup has evolved over time\, fuelled by Feinstein’s m
 asterful song-crafting\, fiercely DIY approach\, and genre-bending sonic i
 dentity\, Water Tower have established themselves as a global force to be 
 reckoned with.\n\nPioneers of a new wave of bluegrass and old-time with a 
 distinctly punk rock flair\, Water Tower take influences from Foghorn Stri
 ngband and Bill Monroe to Rancid and Black Flag\, passing them through a u
 nique lens that magnifies the individual strength of their core and auxili
 ary members while remaining faithful to the revivalist spirit.\n\nIn 2015\
 , the band moved to LA\, where their current lineup of Kenny Feinstein \\(
 lead vocals\, guitar\, fiddle\, mandolin\\)\, Tommy Drinkard \\(banjo\, vo
 cals\\)\, Taylor Estes \\(Bass\, Vocals\, and Nicholas Leahy \\(mandolin\,
  vocals\\) can often be found busking while not in the studio or on tour.\
 n\nSince then\, Water Tower have built major momentum\, releasing a concep
 t album Fly Around \\(ft. guest vocals from Black Flag’s Ron Reyes and p
 roduced by Don Bolles of The Germs\\)\, filming 1m\\+ view viral videos\, 
 and catching the eye of A-listers including Katy Perry\, whose 2023 NYE pa
 rty they played at\, and Riff Raff\, who shouted out “Take Me Back”\, 
 the debut single from their upcoming album Live from Los Angeles\, to be r
 eleased later this year. A slew of tour dates in the US and the UK has alr
 eady been announced.

DESCRIPTION:We said we were a community hub\, right? We said we bring Heal
 dsburg to life? Well… it’s time to put our money where our mouth is. A
 nd we’re doing it right! We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand
 -up comedy nights with one of the best standup comedians in town (in our o
 pinion\, in other people’s opinions\, and soon\, in your opinion too): S
 teve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night
  in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Eithe
 r way\, Steve is back. He’s our main man\, living-room ringmaster\, and 
 the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an 
 MC for friends’ bands\, which eventually led to his first stand-up set -
  a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants P
 ass\, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead\, he embr
 aced the stage as a place for brutally honest\, painfully awkward life con
 fessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy\, or very\, very funny co
 medy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup 
 - a proud Midwesterner now living in California\, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist
  in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite
  at The Punchline San Francisco\, Cobb’s\, San Jose Improv\, Rooster T. 
 Feathers\, and Don’t Tell Comedy\, and performs regularly at clubs and f
 estivals across California and beyond. If sharp\, witty\, and hilarious is
  your vibe\, Jalisa’s got you covered.\n\nAnd then there’s Ronn Vigh -
  our headliner. Ronn has written for *Fashion Police* on E! Television and
  performs stand-up at clubs\, colleges\, and venues across the country. He
  still dreams of becoming a weatherman (we support the dream). In the mean
 time\, he’s an avid yogi (when not hungover)\, a devoted *Golden Girls* 
 fan\, and - despite being gay - a lifelong football lover.

SUMMARY:XO Chips XO\, Halou and Identical Homes
DESCRIPTION:Petaluma’s own Xo Chips Xo makes tightly constructed electronic music that leans toward 80s minimal pop—crisp beats\, angular bass/synth lines\, balancing precision with a dry\, playful edge. \nHalou is the long-running project of Ryan and Rebecca Coseboom who quietly built a deeply devoted audience by writing music that feels like an internal conversation. Their sound blends dream-pop\, electronic atmospheres\, and intimate songwriting that has resonated far beyond expectations.  \nIdentical Homes is the experimental project of California-based musician and producer Daniel McKenzie\, known for his work in bands like The Rum Diary\, Built for the Sea\, and Shuteye Unison. With Identical Homes\, he creates a deeply atmospheric and exploratory sonic world\, blending elements of ambient\, post-rock\, electronic\, and art-pop. Live\, Daniel is joined by Jake Krohn (Shuteye Unison\, The Action Design)\, Lia Rose (Built for the Sea)\, and Greg Kelly (Sunset Junior\, Fight Like Fight). Together\, they trade instruments often\, weaving between ambient interludes\, tribal rhythms\, and dreamy pop choruses.

DESCRIPTION:Understanding the Nervous Systems of Horses and Humans with He
 art and Mind Equine's HSH (highly sensitive horses). Everyone welcome.\n\n
 **Speaking Horse Class** is offered by Heart & Mind Equine Horse Rescue. T
 his began as our volunteer class and has expanded to serve the larger comm
 unity. A chance to meet our rescued therapy horses\, check out our volunte
 er program\, and learn some holistic horse keeping and equine assisted ser
 vices (e.g. therapy\, coaching\, leadership\, and teambuilding with horses
 ). NO experience necessary\, and both horse and mental health professional
 s are welcome--truly all are welcome (9+ years old.)\n\nCurious about Equi
 ne Assisted Psychotherapy? Speaking Horse is not therapy\, but it is an op
 portunity to get a "taste" of EAP because we use some of the same tools an
 d exercises in both settings. So come out out and meet the herd (both huma
 ns and horses) connected with Friendly Trails and Heart & Mind Equine.\n\n
 Each month the class is centered on a holistic horse keeping theme\, equin
 e assisted learning\, understanding herd dynamics\, holistic horse care an
 d training\, or how they all relate to our human journey. FEBRUARY THEME: 
 Year of the Fire Horse As the Lunar New Year is in February\, we will borr
 ow the theme of the passing Year of the Snake\, shedding what is old and n
 o longer needed and embracing the power and majesty of the horse. This tim
 e of year also coincides with the horses literally shedding (plan to be co
 vered in horse hair as we groom them.) We will explore how the herd's ecos
 ystem changes as they experience spring and the lessons we can learn from 
 them.\n\nHorse lovers\, highly sensitive people\, mental health providers\
 , parents\, and teachers might especially benefit from this class as well 
 as horse owners/riders who hope to improve their relationships with their 
 equine partners. (Though this work is great for dogs as well\, your dogs a
 re not welcome at our horse rescue due to liability and distraction concer
 ns.) Newcomers and novices are most welcome.\n\nCome and experience the ma
 gic of working with horses firsthand. Get ready to roll up your sleeves\, 
 get your hands dirty\, and connect with these majestic creatures. Whether 
 you're a seasoned equestrian or just starting out\, there's something for 
 everyone at our Speaking Horse classes. Don't miss out on this exciting ch
 ance to bond with horses and fellow horse lovers. We can't wait to see you
  there!

 anese practice of shinrin yoku or “forest bathing.” Forest bathing is 
 the intentional practice of slowing down and immersing oneself in the sigh
 ts\, sounds\, smells\, and sensations of the natural world in order to res
 tore well-being and deepen our relationship with nature.\n\nThis walk will
  be led by Susan Karle\, a Certified Forest Therapy Guide\, who brings ove
 r a decade of experience guiding nature connection practices with people o
 f all ages. Her approach integrates her background in grief and trauma wor
 k with a deep respect for the healing power of nature.

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ========**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to conn
 ect more fully with ourselves\, each other and with the land. There will b
 e two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to
  be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit
  and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an
  invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to p
 ut away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be full
 y present with each other\, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***
 \n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please me
 ssage Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people 
 drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n*
 *Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offere
 d as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful pr
 actice that opens and gladdens the heart\, relaxes the contraction of ‘s
 elf’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna p
 ractice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or ca
 sh is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8\; last four digits
  4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at leas
 t 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a wa
 itlist. If your plans change and you're not coming\, opening up a spot 4-5
  days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than
  if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you canc
 el at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

DESCRIPTION:When the tide is high\, the Petaluma River opens into a quiete
 r\, greener world.\n\nJoin The Floathouse crew for a gentle\, guided paddl
 e upstream\, timed to higher tides that allow access beyond the downtown c
 hannel and into a tranquil tidal slough. With extra water beneath us\, we
 ’re able to glide into calm\, lush stretches of the river that are norma
 lly out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty o
 f the Petaluma River’s brackish\, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets
 \, blue herons\, snowy egrets\, turtles basking along the banks\, and abun
 dant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply 
 grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away wi
 thin minutes.\n\nAlong the way\, knowledgeable guides share stories of the
  river’s ecology and human history\, offering insight into how this uppe
 r channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare op
 portunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downto
 wn.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists

DESCRIPTION:Command the stage! Be dramatic!\n\nSpoken-word presentations r
 ange from storytelling to social justice commentary to moody memoir. No ex
 perience is needed to learn techniques of this dynamic hybrid art that bor
 rows from poetry\, theater\, dance\, hip-hop\, jazz\, rock\, and dance. Sp
 oken-word master Josef Aukee will lead this workshop\, ages fourteen to ad
 ult. He will guide participants in shaping ideas into short performances a

  is the author of the poetry collections Town and Country\, Where Bright S
 tripes Go and Hill People\, and together with Giles Reaves\, he recorded a
  live production of his poetry show Industrial Strength. His work ranges f
 rom meditations and satirical commentary on contemporary urban life to the
  poetry of place. Josef often colors his live performances with vocalists 
 and instrumentalists who provide dramatic voices and experimental musical 
 backdrops\, using spare electronic sounds and pop and jazz stylings.\n\nLi

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein

 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 ill also find information on best foraging practices and culinary techniqu
 es. The second half of this book introduces you to mushroom identification

 amazing breadth and diversity of the fungal kingdom. With colorful and com
 prehensive science illustrations\, mushroom photography\, and QR codes lin
 king to resources to help you continue your fungal explorations\, this is 
 the perfect portal to step through into the world of mushrooms. “Gordon 
 Walker’s book is fun\, yes\, and richly illustrated\, but at the same ti
 me it’s an impressively detailed survey of the fungal kingdom and its fa
 scinating denizens\, mushrooms and molds\, yeasts\, and more.”—Harold 
 McGee\, author of On Food and Cooking and Nose Dive “Gordon Walker’s e
 nthusiasm on the pages \\(and in person\\) is contagious\, and he’s a gr

 of wine fermentations\, bioprocess control\, and yeast genetics. He is a p
 assionate advocate for mushrooms\, fungal conservation\, and environmental

 lly transform the way people learn about mushrooms and fungi\, serving as 
 the go to resource for a whole new generation of mycophiles and people int

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and

 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa

 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu

 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 chelle Lambert brings a world of experience when she steps up to the micro
 phone. This Pop singer/songwriter has toured from coast to coast making wa
 ves all over the country. Michelle's 2021 single Come to Me has caught the
  attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from 
 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki
 ng music ever since. A pop folk and hip-hop artist whose career has taken 
 her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic 
 music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn
  more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n"Michelle Lambert is the kind of ele
 ctric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Wh
 ether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a c
 onfident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between 
 the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the sta

 rt is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!"\n\n-Den
 nis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a
  melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influenc
 es when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emo
 tional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishe
 s in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWh
 y Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute 
 interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stresse
 d out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyo
 nd Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Mad
 e plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something s
 till isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the r
 ight things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\, or creative en
 deavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrated underneath it
  all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But becau
 se there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T
  TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when conf
 idence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up re
 sponsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progres
 s without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) throu
 gh uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of re
 al-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle culture.\n\nEverythi
 ng you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\, adjusted\, and prac
 ticed in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and real life.\n\nWHAT THI
 S WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a pra
 ctical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in plannin
 g and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t com
 e first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How s
 mall\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited t
 o slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what actually matters right 
 now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• 
 Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about w
 hat you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop w
 aiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willing
 ness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\
 n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually
  holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed se
 nse of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next step forward\n\n• A pra
 ctical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretendin

DESCRIPTION:with Kate Munding\, Jennifer Berezan\, DaRa Williams and Erin 
 Treat\n\nAcross centuries and continents\, women have deep roots in the Bu
 ddha Dharma. They have been great contributors and carriers of the lineage
  and yet have too often remained hidden beneath the surface of history. Th
 eir stories are fierce\, resilient\, and revolutionary. Do you know them?\
 n\nFrom the first Buddhist nuns who challenged the norms of their time\, t
 o modern-day teachers\, mothers\, activists\, and visionaries reshaping sp
 iritual life today\, women have always been keystones to the continuation 
 of the Dharma. This benefit event invites all genders to step into that le
 gacy—to see\, honor\, and draw strength from the women who have shaped t
 he Dharma with their courage and uncompromising truth.\n\nTogether with an
  inspiring group of contemporary Dharma teachers\, we’ll explore these s
 tories and ask: What guidance do these spiritual ancestors offer us now—
 when clarity\, groundedness\, and collective courage are so urgently neede
 d?

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:With more than 50 years of experience and five advanced degree
 s\, Dr. Maria is known worldwide as a medical intuitive\, channel\, empath
 \, teacher\, and Lakota/Diné Traditional Elder.\n\nDuring this time of g
 reat upheaval in our world\, and specifically in our country\, the environ
 ments we live in and create for ourselves can have dramatic impacts on our
  cellular healing and processing. Dr. Maria Michael will talk about how cl
 imate change\, social justice and our environments impact our physical\, m
 ental\, emotional and spiritual bodies. She will talk about the importance
  of self care\, focusing on the most impacted organs\, how to recognize wh
 at is needed\, and ways in which to support yourself\, physically\, emotio
 nally\, spiritually\, and mentally. She will focus on herbal medicine and 
 other somatic and ancient methods to support the immune system. There will
  be time for an open dialogue with the audience and to answer questions. W
 hat makes this evening especially powerful is that it takes place within t
 he amplified bioenergetic field of the EESystem. As Dr. Maria speaks about
  cellular resonance\, coherence\, and restoring balance\, guests will simu
 ltaneously be immersed in a scalar-energy environment designed to support 
 optimal cellular communication and energetic harmony. The experience becom
 es more than a lecture — it becomes embodied learning.\n\nThis event off
 ers a welcoming introduction to Dr. Maria’s work. For those who feel ca
 lled to go deeper\, Dr Maria will hold on March 15th a group healing circl
 e ceremony/workshop. It is a guided interactive process\, in which each pa
 rticipant will experience a variety of techniques using light\, sound\, to
 uch\, energy and ancient wisdom healing techniques. Whether you are new to
  her work or already familiar with energy-based healing\, this evening is 
 an invitation to explore what becomes possible when wisdom\, frequency\, a
 nd intention align. We look forward to welcoming you into the field.\n\nAb
 out Dr Maria Michael\n\nDr. Maria D. Michael is a world renowned and respe
 cted medical intuitive\, channel\, empath\, healer\, psychic and teacher f
 or over 40 years. She has been awarded 5 advanced degrees \\(all Summa Cum
  Laude\\)\, including a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. She has doctorate-
 level training in Neuropsychology and Special Education and extensive post
 -doctoral studies in Psychoanalysis and Jungian Psychology. Additionally\,
  Dr. Michael is trained and experienced in EMDR\, Hypnotherapy\, LENS Neur
 ofeedback\, Neurolinguistic Programming\, Eriksonian Hypnosis Training. Sh
 e is a Lakota/Diné \\(Navajo\\) Traditional elder\, has participated in a
 nd led traditional Native ceremonies and doctored alongside Lakota Medicin
 e people. She has been sought out worldwide for her powerful Medicine Ener
 gies and Healing abilities.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nDr. Maria Michael believes that 
 we all come from the same Creation\, and that everyone has the potential a
 nd capacity to communicate with Creation. While the Lakota call Creation 
 “The Great Mystery\,” other traditions may refer to Creation\, with na
 mes such as\, “God\,” “the Universe\,” “Allah\,” “Yahweh\,
 ” “Divine Love\,” “Universal Love” or “Cosmic Consciousness.
 ”\n\nWe not only choose our human families\, but also we choose\, initia
 lly at least\, our own unique form or tradition of understanding and commu
 nication with the Great Mystery. No form or tradition is better than anoth
 er. Humans are merely attempting to understand “That” which is beyond 
 comprehension.\n\nAll messages from the Great Mystery are compassionate an
 d loving\, even though at times these messages may appear difficult. Creat
 ion’s message appears to us in whatever way we choose to comprehend it. 
 Sometimes\, we are only capable of comprehending deeply sensitive messages
  that resound in our hearts\, and sometimes only strong and “seemingly
 ” shocking messages penetrate our defenses. This loving Spirit guides us
  to remove those obstacles that stand in our way of becoming all that Crea
 tion and We intended us to be.

  All Seats  $25 Hailing from Croatia\, Brazil\, Seattle and New York City\
 , USA\, the Astrid Kuljanic Transatlantic Exploration Company unites four 
 musical worlds\, bound by a shared dedication and curiosity for music. Ast
 rid’s instinct for exploration brought her to New York\, where she quick
 ly became immersed in musical communities from India and Brazil\, Klezmer 
 music\, avant-garde improvisation\, and electronic experimentation.  She c
 arefully drew from these circles her new band members: accordionist Benjam
 in Rosenblum\, bassist Mat Muntz and percussionist Rogerio Boccato. The ba
 nd developed a strong connection through regular performances of Astrid’
 s original music\, arrangements of jazz and Brazilian standards\, and trad
 itional and popular songs from Eastern Europe.  Performance highlights inc
 lude The Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.\, Gramercy Theatre and Waldorf 
 Astoria in New York City\, and each performance is charged with interactiv
 e improvisation and rhythmic intensity.  The band celebrated their first a
 lbum – an energetic set of music with rolling momentum – with a sold o
 ut concert release party at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.

DESCRIPTION:Coming off the heels of a lively\, full-house record release s
 how at Sweetwater\, **Wreckless Strangers** continue their album release c
 elebration with a special dinner show at the legendary West Marin roadhous
 e **Rancho Nicasio** on **Saturday\, March 7\,** joined by special guests
 \, including a horn section alongside the six-piece band. The Bay Area sex
 tet is thrilled to bring their signature sound back to the iconic venue. M
 usic begins at **7:30 pm**\, with dinner reservations available from **6 p
 m to 8 pm**.\n\nWreckless Strangers return to their roots with their forth
 coming studio album\, ***Dirty Souls***. The six-song collection marks the
  band’s most raw and visceral effort to date — a modern take on the ar
 ena rock of the 1970s and ’80s that inspired their earliest musical infl
 uences.\n\nThe songwriting is among their most intimate and personal\, exp
 loring themes of relationships\, loss\, empowerment\, and perseverance. Co
 -lead singers **Amber Morris** and **David Noble** function as a single o
 rganism\, bringing the songs to life with bluesy grit\, soul\, and humanit
 y bolstered by rock-solid\, road-hewn grooves. \n\n***Dirty Souls*** is 
 the band’s third studio outing under the tutelage of Grammy-winning prod
 ucer **Dave Way**\, who fosters a level of depth and organic cohesion that
  firmly establishes Wreckless Strangers in San Francisco’s storied rock 
 ‘n’ roll legacy.  The first single\, "Dirty Soul\," came out on Janua
 ry 23 and is available on all streaming platforms. The full album comes ou
 t in late March\, but concert attendees will have the exclusive opportunit
 y to purchase advance copies of the CD. Review copies are available now\, 
 upon request.\n\nVisit **WrecklessStrangers.com** and follow the band on 
 social media for updates.

DESCRIPTION:with Carol Cano\, MA and Ayya Santacitta\n\nIn a world of cons
 tant change and uncertainty\, this half-day of mindfulness practice offers
  an invitation to return to what is steady and reliable. Drawing from Fore
 st Buddhist teachings and earth-based awareness\, we will cultivate a peac
 e that does not depend on conditions. A peace that arises from being fully
  present\, embodied\, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditat
 ion\, and periods of silence\, we will explore the body as part of the liv
 ing earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than 
 striving for calm\, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds 
 us—moment by moment\, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to 
 slow down\, listen deeply\, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace withi
 n our own hearts.

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

 ly influenced living in the middle east as a child of a military father st
 ationed there in the 1950's. Join us for an afternoon of mystery and story
 telling with Jazzmyn\, accompanied by middle eastern food and fine wines a
 vailable for purchase. Settle in and be transported! Free admission\, all 
 donations happily accepted.   She writes "I am nine years old living in Da
 macus\, Syria. My father is on a diplomatic assignment with the United Nat
 ions to ease tensions on the volatile border between Jordan and Israel. We
  are transferred from Damacus\, Syria\, to Jerusalem\, Jordan in late 1955
 . I came to know and love my Bedouin neighbors. They kindly lend me their 
 only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in th
 e Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beauti
 ful\, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and 
 generous neighbors. Ten years ago\, I picked up volume number one of "The 
 Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night" translated by Sir Richard Franc
 is Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her
  emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of eve
 ry young\, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volume
 s of "Shah Razad" i felt compelled to continue this extraordinary traditio
 n of storytelling\, intended to transmit moral values\, by adding my own s
 tory: Shah Razad...and the Djinns Who Loved Her.

  Hope & Sex & Dreams with a celebratory exhibit on display at the Milwauke
 e County Historical Society\, a limited edition Sprecher beer-BoDeans Orig
 inal Ginger Brew\, and numerous shows\, including a much anticipated retur
 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton
  Kutcher\, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent i
 nstallation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part 
 of their Midwest Artists exhibit.

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers

SUMMARY:Poetry Book Club: My Infinity by Didi Jackson

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Li
 brary and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuse
 s on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event\,
  but we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look f
 orward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK \\#1 New York Times best seller! B
 ooklist Editors’ Choice 2015 - Youth! Named a "Best Book of 2015" by Tim
 e Magazine\, School Library Journal\, Barnes & Noble\, NPR\, PopSugar\, Th
 e Millions\, and The News & Observer! Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One w
 ho's ever been chosen. That's what his roommate\, Baz\, says. And Baz migh
 t be evil and a vampire and a complete git\, but he's probably right. Half
  the time\, Simon can't even make his wand work\, and the other half\, he 
 starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him\, his girlfriend broke
  up with him\, and there's a magic-eating monster running around\, wearing
  Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this\, if he were 
 here--it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks\, and Simon's 
 infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost sto
 ry\, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking a
 s you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far\, far more monsters. 
 "Rowell imbues her magic with awe and spectacle. It's a powerful\, politic
 ally minded allegory about sexual\, ethnic and class identity - with a hea
 dy shot of teenage lust." —New York Times Book Review "It’s a brillian
 tly addictive\, genuinely romantic story about teenagers who can’t be ne
 atly sorted into houses\, coping with stress and loss and the confusion of
  just trying to be who they are. It’s as if Rowell turned the Harry Pott
 er books inside out\, and is showing us the marvelous\, subversive stuffin
 g inside." —Time Magazine "Full of heart and humor\, this fantastical ta
 le is a worthy addition to the wizarding-school genre." —People Magazine
  ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rainbow Rowell is the award-winning \\#1 New York Times 
 bestselling author of Eleanor & Park and the Simon Snow Trilogy\, plus sev
 eral other novels\, short stories\, and comics. She lives in Omaha\, Nebra
 ska\, just like most of her characters.

DESCRIPTION:Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of leg
 acy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group\, meeting
  to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous\, or not-so-famous\\) poets o
 f the past & present who have left a mark on literature\, the art of poetr
 y\, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male\
 , female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & e
 rotic\, political\, pastoral & personal\, dreamers\, ragers\, firebrands\,
  sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize\, 
 and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interest
 ed poets & potential participants\, the library will publish this growing 
 list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review\, with
  a short bio & picture\, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poet
 s listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from part
 icipants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wed
 nesday of each month\, we will gather for a round-table review of several 
 poets\, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to expl
 ore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meet
 ing to read about their chosen poet\, explore one or more biographies & se
 veral poems\, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gather
 ing. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems
 \, then we will open a discussion among the participants\, after which tha
 t participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant w
 ill then read a chosen poem\, followed by a discussion\, as well as his or
  her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants
  have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present\, eac
 h segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list 
 at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei

At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you\, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun\, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every
  year.

 e your ticket/s now before it is sold out.\n\nAbout Americana Reimagined: 
 On the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States\, Americana 
 Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore\, r
 einterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of &ldquo\;Americana&rdquo\
 ;. This juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar s
 ymbols\, stories\, and styles evolve over time&mdash\;bridging the past an
 d present through creativity and craft. \n\n&ldquo\;Americana&rdquo\; has 
 long served as a reflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town
  iconography and handmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. 
 In Americana Reimagined artists reexamine this broad theme\, juxtaposing t
 he old and the new\, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh per
 spectives on what they mean today.\n\nJurors \n\nDonna Seager\, Donna Seag
 er Fine Arts &amp\; Artists' Books  Richard Neill\, Multimedia Artist and 
 Film curator Simon Corwin\, Petaluma Artist and Jewelry\n\nStates of Anxie
 ty\, States of HopeExhibition Dates: March 12 - April 18\, 2026Opening Rec
 eption: Thursday\, March 12\, 5:30-7:30pm\n\nAbout States of Anxiety\, Sta
 tes of Hope: This exhibition presents a selection of works by artist Inez 
 Storer that reflect on the emotional\, cultural\, and political complexiti
 es of contemporary life. Building on themes explored in Americana Reimagin
 ed\, Storer's paintings offer a layered meditation on identity\, memory\, 
 and collective experience in times of uncertainty and transformation.\n\nT
 hrough her distinctive magical realist collage method\, Storer constructs 
 richly textured visual narratives that merge personal history with broader
  social realities. Her works are composed of fragments&mdash\;symbols\, im
 ages\, and artifacts drawn from her life and interests.\n\nStorer's painti
 ngs guide the viewer on a journey through both historical memory and inter
 nal landscapes. They balance darkness and light\, anxiety and hope.  She a
 sks us to reflect on the conditions of our moment. States of Anxiety\, Sta
 tes of Hope affirms art's capacity to illuminate struggle while nurturing 
 resilience\, empathy\, and connection.

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.

DESCRIPTION:Greg Lamboy has called Finnegan's Marin home for over a decade
 . Every second Thursday of the month\, this Tiburon-based troubadour settl
 es into the warmly lit corner of Novato's beloved neighborhood pub and doe
 s what he does best: connects. An accomplished guitarist and award-winning
  songwriter\, Lamboy has earned his stripes across the Bay Area scene both
  as a solo artist and as frontman of Pacific Standard\, his soulful Americ
 ana band. His five acclaimed albums draw praise for melodies that are pitc
 h-perfect and lyrics that feel like they were written specifically for you
 . At Finnegan's\, a lively Irish pub and American bar and grill along a tr
 ee-lined street in downtown Novato\, Lamboy's intimate style is perfectly 
 at home. No pretense. No distance. Just a strong clear voice\, commanding 
 guitar\, and songs that\, as one critic put it\, lift you above the everyd
 ay. Come early\, grab a pint\, and let the music find you. https://greglam

 hrough creativity and craft.&nbsp\; “Americana” has long served as a r
 eflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town iconography and h

 ives that merge personal history with broader social realities. Her works 
 are composed of fragments—symbols\, images\, and artifacts drawn from he
 r life and interests. Storer's paintings guide the viewer on a journey thr
 ough both historical memory and internal landscapes. They balance darkness
  and light\, anxiety and hope.&nbsp\; She asks us to reflect on the condit
 ions of our moment. States of Anxiety\, States of Hope affirms art’s cap
 acity to illuminate struggle while nurturing resilience\, empathy\, and co
 nnection. Biography Storer lives in Inverness\, California\, and has a stu
 dio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic fat
 her and Jewish mother\, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her f
 ather worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design\, her work oft
 en creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Sh
 ortly before her death\, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to 
 escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertr
 ansport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work
  with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the
  Jewish Museum in New York\, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis\, Oak
 land Museum of Art \, the de Young Museum\, San José Museum of Art\, Mont
 erey Museum of Art\, Missoula Museum of Art\, National Museum of American 
 Jewish History\, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts\, Washington
 \, DC. At the same time\, our friends at IceHouse Gallery will hold a comp
 anion exhibition of Storer’s Works on Paper. Exhibition dates are March 
 7 - March 28. RSVP HERE #block-yui_3_17_2_1_1771185310791_2990 {--sqs-bloc

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

  on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color\, emotion\, and momentum. 
  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps\, c
 risp footwork\, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's 
 2025 tour.\n\nPapadakis\, Czisny and Ward's presence elevates every phrase
 &mdash\;their power\, musical instinct\, and magnetic connection ignite th
 e audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: 
 athletic\, cinematic\, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 20
 26\, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance d
 ance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo\;THE SEAS
 ONS isn't just a show&mdash\;it's a pulse\, a spark\, a reminder that when
  blades meet music and movement meets heart\, the ice itself begins to sin
 g.&rdquo\; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be communit
 y events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI compa
 ny. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/
 cross overs\, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. C
 lasses will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth 
 and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and a
 dvance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chanc
 e for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast me
 mbers. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show\, regroup an
 d get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.

 post-punk / indie project led by Elisa Ovrahim. Gorgeous layered vocals\, 
 ringing guitars\, cinematic folk shadows\, and minimalist ethereal pop. Th

 garden\, Melvins\\) and has already carved its place on indie radio. Fresh
  from the Love & Rockets tour\, Agness Twin’s live set will swallow you 
 whole.\n\n🔥 Pro-Pain!\n\nBay Area 4-piece that’s “HAVING A BLAST.
 ” High-voltage energy\, pure grit\, and a sound built to light up the ro

 underground scene is very much alive and screaming.\n\nEvery Second Friday
 \, Indie After Dark brings the spotlight to independent music at the intim
 ate and vibey 4th Corner Speakeasy in downtown Vallejo. Just steps from th
 e heart of the Vallejo Art Walk\, this monthly series invites you to disco
 ver bold new sounds in a setting made for connection—where the lights ar
 e low\, the cocktails are strong\, and the music runs deep.\n\nCome early 
 for the art\, stay late for the music. It’s a night where Vallejo’s cr
 eative soul shines.

DESCRIPTION:with Dana DePalma\, MA\, MFT and Matthew Brensilver\, PhD\n\nT
 he Buddha says that wise view is the starting point—it is also the culmi
 nation of awakening. Yet\, delusion comes camouflaged as wisdom. What we 
 do not yet understand shapes our view and obscures freedom. What are the p
 rocesses by which we realize and align with our deepest knowing?\n\nTogeth
 er\, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us 
 wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep at
 tention\, spiritual friendship\, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll 
 reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matte
 rs in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experie
 nce of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and l
 ove.\n\nDuring this day of practice\, we’ll offer guided and silent medi
 tation practice\, Dharma reflections\, and time for dialogue. All are welc
 ome.

 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

SUMMARY:English Country Dance Marin
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon
 g lines (like contra)\, circles\, or in geometric sets (squares\, triangle
 s). Like our contra dances\, there is live music and a caller. You can com
 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nAdmission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affil
 iates.

 Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Pleas
 e bring your arsenal of sea chanteys\, any musical instruments you'd like\

 s lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus\, and leading 
 a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share
 \, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea c

  chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal\, mellow\

  lead a song\, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather
  just singalong with the chantey choruses\, that's fine too. We always hav
 e a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of a
 ll levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys\, there may be lyrics that ar
 e not appropriate for children. Reservations not required. To be added to

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:Take a guided hike to the historic orchard\, now part of Jack 
 London State Historic Park\, and learn about its remarkable restoration. 
  Along the way\, keep an eye out for seasonal wildflowers and perhaps the 
 first delicate blossoms on early blooming fruit trees.\n\nOriginally plant
 ed between 1908 and 1912\, the orchard flourished in Jack London’s time 
 before being abandoned for many years. Today\, thanks to dedicated restora
 tion efforts\, it can once again be enjoyed by all who walk its trails.\n\
 nThe experience begins with an overview presented by Eric Metz\, Director 
 of Operations\, who will share the history of the orchard and the challeng
 es involved in its revival. From there\, participants will hike through re
 dwoods and mixed oak woodlands on a moderate\, six-mile round-trip trek to
  the orchard.\n\n At the orchard\, guests will tour the areas that have b
 een thoughtfully revitalized and learn about unique obstacles overcome in 
 restoring this landscape.

DESCRIPTION:with James Baraz\, MA\n\nSpring is a natural time to reflect o
 n what we are holding on to and what may be ready to be released. Just wha
 t does the phrase “let go” mean? Renunciation (*nekkhama* in Pāli)\,
  one of the ten perfections\, is often misunderstood as sacrifice—someth
 ing we should do because it’s “good for us.” In early Buddhist teach
 ings\, *nekkhama* is described not as deprivation\, but as a letting go 
 that supports genuine contentment and well-being\, rooted in seeing more c
 learly what leads to suffering and what leads to freedom.\n\nDuring this d
 aylong program\, which includes periods of guided silent sitting and walki
 ng meditation\, participants will explore how habitual grasping—to thoug
 hts\, personal stories\, possessions\, roles\, and a sense of control—sh
 apes inner experience and contributes to stress. Drawing from contemplativ
 e teachings and incorporating perspectives from psychology on attachment a
 nd habitual mental patterns\, our reflections and practices will focus on 
 meeting these patterns with awareness and kindness\, loosening unhelpful s
 elf-stories\, softening the impulse to control\, and cultivating generosit
 y. This program is educational in nature and welcomes both new and experie
 nced practitioners.

  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 music with Men of Worth. In 1986\, Scotsman Donnie Macdonald and Irishman 
 James Keigher came together to perform Irish and Scottish folk music\, com
 bining traditional and contemporary styles. The name "Men of Worth" was ch
 osen from the title of a folk song written by the Scottish singer/songwrit
 er Archie Fisher. Together Men of Worth blend their voices with harmony an
 d support their collection of songs with their varied selection of instrum
 ents. They have a very simple approach to their presentation\, and in keep
 ing with tradition\, remain true to the music and story. Their show is a u
 nique combination of humour\, exciting tunes\, and soulful\, heartfelt bal
 lads. Men of Worth are an international act\, and have earned much respect
  and success in over thirty years of touring together. Performing concerts
  and festivals\, with twelve albums to their credit\; Men of Worth continu
 e the very tradition from which they've evolved.

 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 ON: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists and ce
 lebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a 
 beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSono
 ma County artist\, Tosya Shore\, presents Celebrating Women\, paintings th
 at commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s waterc
 olor works capture women in their element\, showing the multiple facets of
  their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and 
 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth
 ing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the
  Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks
  Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein Air\, a collection
  unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the 
 streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffer captured iconic sc
 enes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural v
 ibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored hangout for espresso 
 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le
 vel trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is f
 or Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through th
 ese plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of being there”\, stat
 ed Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on M

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every
  year.

DESCRIPTION:There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feel
 s like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way
 . His voice is raw and real\, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’
 s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest\, and that’s
  exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Am
 ericana\; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie\, blues lege
 nds like Howlin’ Wolf\,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe\, an
 d master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and c
 onnects audiences\, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren
 ’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s so
 ft and haunting\, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay wi
 th you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sou
 nd. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness\, conn
 ection\, love\, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band s
 how\, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOv
 er the years\, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless to
 uring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists 
 like Shakey Graves\, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\, Sarah Jarosz\, and Alic
 e O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock\, SXSW\, and High Si
 erra Music Festival\, but his focus has always been on making music that m
 eans something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending y
 ears on the road\, self-funding his albums\, and navigating the ups and do
 wns of life as an independent artist\, husband\, and father. But through i
 t all\, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music th
 at connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real\, that makes
  you stop and listen\, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.

 o see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sa
 mpling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and e
 xperienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawin
 g subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah 
 Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her uniq
 ue approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. Th
 is class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicing observ
 ational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessio

 ild muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its
  own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials a

 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth

 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le

DESCRIPTION:with Pawan Bareja\, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with o
 ur deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is per
 sonal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the weight
  of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse\, a
 nger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are inv
 ited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through em
 bodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticing wh
 ere activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-o
 pening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner cla
 rity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what
  has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measurable\
 , and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many experie
 nce deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to love
 d ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 w up in Seattle in the 90’s during a thriving grunge movement\, obsessin
 g over bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam while being exposed to bands like 
 the Grateful Dead and Jethro Tull by his uncles\, who taught him the signi
 ficance of music. He ended up moving to Sonoma County as a teenager\, wher
 e punk dominated the mainstream. After playing in a hardcore band for a nu
 mber of years\, Presti discovered an affinity for acoustic guitar and folk
  songwriting and eventually settled in San Francisco where he formed his b
 acking band\, The Tusslers. Presti’s style encompasses folk nuances mixe
 d with the inspirations of his rock upbringing. He’s released two full l
 ength albums\, including his second record in 2017\, Existentialism\, reco
 rded at John Vanderslice’s Tiny Telephone Studios and is currently worki
 ng on his latest release due out this year\, Different Places\, at Hyde St
 reet Studios.

SUMMARY:Olompali State Historic Park - Exploratory Hike
DESCRIPTION:Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a
  moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation cha
 nges.***\n\nThe park overlooks the Petaluma River and San Pablo Bay from t
 he east-facing slopes of 1\,558 foot Mount Burdell. The name "olompali" co
 mes from the Miwok language and may be translated as "southern village" or
  "southern people." The Coast Miwok inhabited at least one site within the
  area of the present-day park continuously from as early as 6\,000 BC\, un
 til the early 1850s.\n\n**Distance:** +/- 9 miles total\; out and back\n\n
 **The hike:**\nExploratory because I've not led this hike and it has been 
 many years since I hiked it. We'll start off on the Miwok Trail to Burdell

 re will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other.
  These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfuln

 e Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Ric
 k Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladden
 s the heart\, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into t
 he world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered**
  and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Ve

SUMMARY:The Crooked Stuff
DESCRIPTION:Existential discopunk for the people! The Crooked Stuff transmits a hybrid\, body-moving\, synthesizer-driven sound that’s been cross-pollinated and grown at the sonic crossroads of ’70s funk\, ’80s punk and new wave\, ’90s alternative\, and ’00s electronic dance music. At the core\, the music is fueled by a blend of introspective searching and life-affirming extroverted blasts that aim to shock audiences into their own inspired moments of living forward and free. \nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area\, the trio (vocals\, synths & drums) was born from the unique mash-up of founding members Tom G. (vocals) and John Varn (synths) and their diverse musical backgrounds. Tom’s roots trace back to the Washington\, D.C.\, hardcore punk and new wave scene\, which was also intertwined with the district’s heavy go-go and soul sounds. Varn grew up in the Bay Area music scene\, surrounded by and mentored by its legendary psychedelic rock and funk players. Together\, the two have created a full-spectrum sound experience that continually morphs and blends their wide-ranging influences and polar-opposite backgrounds. \nFans say The Crooked Stuff’s complex sonic formula consistently delivers an undeniable\, energizing live-show reaction. One called it “like INXS injected into The Prodigy.” Another said\, “It’s somewhere between Gorillaz\, Daft Punk\, and TV on the Radio.” Someone else described it as “Johnny Rotten hijacking LCD Soundsystem and throwing Herbie Hancock on synths.” All agreed—they were feeling it! \nThe Crooked Stuff… arise\, release\, be free! \nWeb: www.TheCrookedStuff.com\nIG: www.Instagram.com/TheCrookedStuff\nFB: www.Facebook.com/TheCrookedStuff \nApple Music: https://apple.co/2Ldy0sF\nSpotify: http://bit.ly/The-Crooked-Stuff

DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon
 g lines (like contra)\, circles\, or in geometric sets (squares\, triangle

 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each m
 onth\, 2-4:30 pm\, to live music\, all levels of experience welcome\; and 
 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members

 youth ages 6 – 18.

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.

 n weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if
  you have the time\, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liqui
 d refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering 
 place\, restaurant\, coffee house\, and live music venue. But it's the peo

 Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pa

 ght Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PAR
 TICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our e
 mail list to make you aware of upcoming events\, hikes and walks. You will
  not be spammed. If you are\, let me know. Spamming will not be tolerated.
 \n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\nIt's important to RSVP for these walks. When
  all the people have arrived for a walk that have RSVP'd\, we leave... it 
 might mean we leave early. If you didn't RSVP we are not going to wait for
  you. Plus\, it's just a nice courtesy to the organizer and other particip
 ants. Please take the time to RSVP.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any quest
 ions by using the "Contact Us" link on the left hand side bar of this meet
 up group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nGary\nSCO Org

 n good enough shape to hike at a moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) an
 d comfortable with elevation changes.***\n\n**Distance:** +/- 4 miles\n**T
 he hike:** Join me for an afternoon hike at Shiloh Ranch Regional Park. A 
 loop hike starting with a climb and includes: Big Leaf\, Ridge\, Pond and 
 Creekside trails.\n\n**Parking:** Park in the lot for $8 or free if you ha
 ve a regional park pass.\n\n**Where to meet:** By the Bocce court (near en
 trance) at Shiloh Ranch.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at 
 the start time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and ge
 t situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essen
 tial part of our time together.\n\n**Restroom:** At Trailhead\n\n**What to
  bring:** Snack\, water\, hat\, good hiking shoes\, a joyful spirit and la
 ughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clo
 thing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Re
 minders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully w
 ith ourselves\, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of
  silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive 
 and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect wit
 h each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to b
 ring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell
  phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with e
 ach other\, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're
  on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a f
 ew days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the 
 last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the
  spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna bas
 ed event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that open
 s and gladdens the heart\, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and rippl
 es out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **hea
 rt centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously
  accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8\; last four digits 4714 of my phon
 e # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours befor
 e the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your 
 plans change and you're not coming\, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the
  hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel a
 t the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last m
 inute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.

 oes\, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the wea
 ther that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===============
 ====================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a
  way to connect more fully with ourselves\, each other and with the land. 
 There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow t
 he senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the h
 ike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and conne
 cting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's
  a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technolog
 y to be fully present with each other\, our *senses and the land we are in
 habiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to atte
 nd please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes 
 have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an open
 ing.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hike
 s are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a 
 beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart\, relaxes the contrac
 tion of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.”
  The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity.
  Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8\; last
  four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please ca
 ncel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there
  may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming\, opening u
 p a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to
  attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show
  if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed fro
 m the group.

SUMMARY:English Country Dance Sebastopol
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon
 g lines (like contra)\, circles\, or in geometric sets (squares\, triangle
 s). Like our contra dances\, there is live music and a caller. You can com
 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each m
 onth\, 2-4:30 pm\, to live music\, all levels of experience welcome\; and 
 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members 
 of NBCDS and its affiliates\, $8 for young adults ages 19-30\, and $3 for 
 youth ages 6 – 18.

SUMMARY:Petaluma Contra Dance
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nContra Dance is fun\, quick to learn\,
  and great exercise. Every dance night has a live band\, caller\, and a qu
 ick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance\, you will dance with y
 our partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The
  figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk
  through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we 
 encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comf
 ortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\n
 When to arrive: If this is your first time\, come 30 minutes early to chec
 k in\, join the quick start class\, and get you ready for the first dance.
 \nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing ri
 ght away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group\, couple\, or s
 ingle! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: $13 members\
 , $15 non-members\, $8 student or limited income.

SUMMARY:West Side Stories Petaluma: Too Many Irons In The Fire
DESCRIPTION:West Side Stories at PKCT! \nEveryone has a story and now it’s your chance to tell it. Every month there is a theme\, hopefully that sparks a memory for you. You put your name in a hat (an actual hat!) and 10 people’s names are drawn at random. When your name is pulled you get 5 minutes to tell your personal true story. At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you\, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun\, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.

SUMMARY:English Country Dance Marin
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon
 g lines (like contra)\, circles\, or in geometric sets (squares\, triangle
 s). Like our contra dances\, there is live music and a caller. You can com
 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nAdmission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affil
 iates.

DESCRIPTION:In Conversation with Inez Storer Moderated by Donna Seager Sun
 day\, April 12\, 4:00-5:00pm $15 members\; $20 non-members An afternoon co
 nversation about Inez’s approach to artmaking\, her family history and t
 he stories that inform her art. There will be time for questions. Storer l
 ives in Inverness\, California\, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. 
 Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother\, she 
 spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her father worked as an art direc
 tor. Influenced by stage design\, her work often creates a sense of “the
 atrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Shortly before her death\, her
  mother revealed that she had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later 
 learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of 
 being kept from the truth has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her 
 work is held in many collections including the Jewish Museum in New York\,
  Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis\, Oakland Museum of Art \, the de
  Young Museum\, San José Museum of Art\, Monterey Museum of Art\, Missoul
 a Museum of Art\, National Museum of American Jewish History\, and the Nat
 ional Museum of Women in the Arts\, Washington\, DC. Get tickets #block-15

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.

DESCRIPTION:Santa's Riverboat Arrival\n\nSaturday\, November 28\, 2026\n\
 n11:30am - 1:30pm at River Plaza Shopping Center\n\nSanta and Mrs. Claus 
 are coming to town on November 28\, the Saturday after Thanksgiving!\n\nW
 hen Santa arrives in Petaluma\, he leaves his sleigh at home. Instead\, h
 e and Mrs. Claus make a uniquely Petaluma arrival - they sail up the Peta
 luma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Cent
 er on E. Washington to the cheers of excited children!\n\nStarting at 11:
 30 am\, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa an
 d Mrs. Claus to arrive! The Christmas couple will arrive around noon and 
 will be welcomed by costumed dancers from the Petaluma School of Ballet’s
  “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parkin
 g lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be av
 ailable for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\n
 Santa would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma\, but in order to hea
 r from all the good boys and girls all over the world\, he will have to b
 e on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun sto
 p there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag
  and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local s
 hopping. When we all shop small\, it's not just for the things we love\, 
 but for the businesses we love\, for the community we call home\, and to 
 help promote local economic growth. Learn more about Small Business Satur
