 e planning needs further\, we offer all participants who complete the web
 inar a free\, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorne

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Russian River Fungi Fest in Guerneville
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack\nLet's meet in downtown Guerneville on 
 Saturday\, Feb. 21st at 12pm to learn more about mushrooms (tasty gourmet 
 ones\, not the "magic" kind) while socializing at the same time.\n\nYou do
 n't actually need a ticket to attend\, but they do offer them on Eventbrit
 e for a $15 suggested donation to help defray costs of getting it up and r
 unning. Hopefully weather will be on our side for this one! I think most o
 f the events will be outside. They will have live music\, a mushroom marke
 t\, workshops and more. Restaurants will offer special mushroom-themed men
 us. Solar Punk Farms and the Russian River Chamber of Commerce are organiz
 ing the event.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://www.solarpunkfarms.com/fungi
 fest\n\nAny questions\, just message DJ through Meetup. The event actually
  runs from 10am-6pm on both Feb. 21st and 22nd\, but we'll just be there f
 or about 3 hours on Saturday the 21st\, unless anyone wants to stay longer
 . We'll pick a good meeting place as soon as they release more details.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack

SUMMARY: Free Estate Planning Webinar
DESCRIPTION:Creating your estate plan\, whether it’s a living trust or a 
 will\, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are 
 difficult to think about\, such as death\, incapacity\, finances\, and fa
 mily dynamics. It can be easy to procrastinate\, even though these issues
  may weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our up
 coming free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace o
 f mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational
  webinar\, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families fac
 e and how an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how will
 s and trusts differ\, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and
  how to avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you 
 need to protect yourself and your family\, and leave a legacy of peace. I
 f you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning need
 s further\, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free\, n
 o obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this 
 webinar\, we will discuss several common issues and concerns\, including:
 \n\n  * The advantages and disadvantages of wills\, living trusts\, and p
 robate\n  * Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-s
 pouses\, lawsuits\, and other claims\n  * Most living trusts fail\; if yo
 u already have a trust\, find out what you can do to ensure that it will 
 protect you and your loved ones\n  * How to preserve your nest egg for yo
 ur family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n  * How to stay ou
 t of court and avoid the cost\, time\, and stress that a conservatorship 
 can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a 
 FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions 
 about setting up your estate plan ($425 value).\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective
