SUMMARY:English Country Dance Marin
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon

 s). Like our contra dances\, there is live music and a caller. You can com
 e by yourself or with friends\, since we change partners after each dance.
  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu
 lary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from Engli
 sh country dancing.\n\nAdmission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affil
 iates.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

 ortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\n

 k in\, join the quick start class\, and get you ready for the first dance.

 ght away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group\, couple\, or s
 ingle! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: *Free to fir
 st-time dancers*. $13 members\, $15 non-members\, $8 student or limited in

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors

SUMMARY:Russian River Fungi Fest in Guerneville
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack\nLet's meet in downtown Guerneville on 
 Saturday\, Feb. 21st at 12pm to learn more about mushrooms (tasty gourmet 
 ones\, not the "magic" kind) while socializing at the same time.\n\nYou do
 n't actually need a ticket to attend\, but they do offer them on Eventbrit
 e for a $15 suggested donation to help defray costs of getting it up and r
 unning. Hopefully weather will be on our side for this one! I think most o
 f the events will be outside. They will have live music\, a mushroom marke
 t\, workshops and more. Restaurants will offer special mushroom-themed men
 us. Solar Punk Farms and the Russian River Chamber of Commerce are organiz
 ing the event.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://www.solarpunkfarms.com/fungi
 fest\n\nAny questions\, just message DJ through Meetup. The event actually
  runs from 10am-6pm on both Feb. 21st and 22nd\, but we'll just be there f
 or about 3 hours on Saturday the 21st\, unless anyone wants to stay longer
 . We'll pick a good meeting place as soon as they release more details.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack

 occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes

 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd

 need to protect yourself and your family\, and leave a legacy of peace. I
 f you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning need
 s further\, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free\, n
 o obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this

 robate\n  * Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-s
 pouses\, lawsuits\, and other claims\n  * Most living trusts fail\; if yo
 u already have a trust\, find out what you can do to ensure that it will 
 protect you and your loved ones\n  * How to preserve your nest egg for yo
 ur family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n  * How to stay ou
 t of court and avoid the cost\, time\, and stress that a conservatorship 
 can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

 ght away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group\, couple\, or s
 ingle! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: $13 members\
 , $15 non-members\, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in lon

  If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing\, much of our dance vocabu

 sh country dancing.\n\nAdmission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affil

SUMMARY:San Rafael Contra Dance
DESCRIPTION:North Bay Contra Dance\nContra Dance is fun\, quick to learn\,
  and great exercise. Every dance night has a live band\, caller\, and a qu
 ick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance\, you will dance with y
 our partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The
  figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk
  through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we 
 encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comf
 ortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\n
 When to arrive: If this is your first time\, come 30 minutes early to chec
 k in\, join the quick start class\, and get you ready for the first dance.
 \nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing ri
 ght away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group\, couple\, or s
 ingle! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: *Free to fir
 st-time dancers*. $13 members\, $15 non-members\, $8 student or limited in
 come.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance

SUMMARY:Tuesday Night Fitness Hike: 5+ Fast Miles\, Downtown Petaluma and 
 Western Hills
DESCRIPTION:"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS H
 IKE IS AN AEROBIC\, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES 
 PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE IN
 CLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN)\, AND OUR W
 INTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND
  YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP\, PLE
 ASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS
  OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING 
 ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness 
 Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the
  host each week but he might\, or might not\, show up to the event. This i
 s\, more often than not\, a small group of regular\, fit walkers who show 
 up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promp
 tly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. 
 So\, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there\, you might
  see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike\, 5+ miles fast pa
 ced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portio
 ns in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time)\, and at the Petalu
 ma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitnes
 s Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n
 * Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\
 n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast\, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtow
 n outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant\, He
 ebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the P
 etaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before return
 ing to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the s
 ame route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A go
 od pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun
  attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The side
 walks can be treacherous in west Petaluma\, and you'll want to see those c
 rags\, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also r
 ecommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nT
 he Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesd
 ay Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile\, w
 ith multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and R
 SVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcom
 ing events\, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take t
 he time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally imp
 ortant to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event\, w
 e are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at
  6:10 PM\, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typic
 ally hike the same route for each hike\, and our focus is on aerobic exerc
 ise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the "Contact Us" 
 link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see y
 ou on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective

SUMMARY: Santa's Riverboat Arrival & Small Business Saturday
DESCRIPTION:Santa's Riverboat Arrival\n\nSaturday\, November 28\, 2026\n\
 n11:30am - 1:30pm at River Plaza Shopping Center\n\nSanta and Mrs. Claus 
 are coming to town on November 28\, the Saturday after Thanksgiving!\n\nW
 hen Santa arrives in Petaluma\, he leaves his sleigh at home. Instead\, h
 e and Mrs. Claus make a uniquely Petaluma arrival - they sail up the Peta
 luma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Cent
 er on E. Washington to the cheers of excited children!\n\nStarting at 11:
 30 am\, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa an
 d Mrs. Claus to arrive! The Christmas couple will arrive around noon and 
 will be welcomed by costumed dancers from the Petaluma School of Ballet’s
  “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parkin
 g lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be av
 ailable for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\n
 Santa would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma\, but in order to hea
 r from all the good boys and girls all over the world\, he will have to b
 e on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun sto
 p there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag
  and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local s
 hopping. When we all shop small\, it's not just for the things we love\, 
 but for the businesses we love\, for the community we call home\, and to 
 help promote local economic growth. Learn more about Small Business Satur
