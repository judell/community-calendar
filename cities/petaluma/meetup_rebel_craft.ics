SUMMARY:Happy Hour Crafts
DESCRIPTION:The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest 
 project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to 
 unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed\, drop-in-friendly event. Come 
 when you can\, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are al
 ways welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft
 ” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. 
 Knitting\, crochet\, and other fiber arts are most common\, but we have al
 so warmly welcomed people who sketch\, color\, embroider\, bead\, and more
 . If your craft isn’t portable\, we will happily ooh and aah over photos
  of your work-in-progress\, or chat about your plans for your next project
 .\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome\, and nobody will pressur
 e you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice\, we will try to sit outside
 . If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event\, please consider order
 ing some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go\, in order to help supp
 ort our gracious\, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Pe
 taluma is free\, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit u
 ntil 6pm. To park for longer\, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Str
 eet Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Street
 s. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\
 n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar\, so this event is for adult crafters (though
  you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in
 -arms if you are\, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who 
 are moving about on their own.
