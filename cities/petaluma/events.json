    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    **www.upstairsart gallery.net** \n\nFor further information: Contact: Beverly Bird, Press Contact, at bvdrio@sonic.net or 707-799-1490.",

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40. Materials fees are not discounted.\n\nBecome a member today and find community, connection, and creativity.",

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now? Practices: Guided movement warm-up; sensory awareness; movement exploration of stepping toward/away from a “threshold”; body mapping with paint/collage; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants identify their current state and set creative intentions for the series. Session 2 – Trials & Allies: Shadows and Strengths Theme: Meeting obstacles and discovering resources. Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight.

We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

This spring in-person writing retreat led by Marilyn MacEntyre follows her successful online workshops and in-person retreats in 2023-25.\n\nWe are delighted to invite you to her 2026 spring offering, this retreat will run February 26-28 2026, 4:00 pm Thursday through 3:00 pm Saturday.\n\nEscalating political conflict, a polarized economy, ongoing warfare, and climate anxieties give us plenty of occasion to come face to face with our fears. We may have to dig deeper for hope these days, but we know where to find it. In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how \"Be not afraid\" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation, and how even in the midst of troubles, both public and personal, we can help each other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both our own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will focus on experiences of fear, courage, consolation, and resilience in the historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nMarilyn McEntyre, writer and longtime professor of literature, coaches writers and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley, Western Theological Seminary and the Oblate School of Theology. Her books include Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies, When Poets Pray, and Speaking Peace in a Climate of Conflict. A new book about writing, Start With a Word, is coming out in February 2026 and can be pre-ordered at eerdmans.com. See more, and contact her, at marilynmcentyre.com.\n\nCost: $295-$695 depending on choices about lodging/commuting\n\nPartial scholarships available \n\nRegister at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/be-not-afraid",

There are some hills to climb on this hike.\n\n**Parking:** Street parking on Parktrail Drive\n\n**Where to Meet:** Intersection of Parktrail Drive and Comfrey Place on the sidewalk.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**What to bring:** Snack, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

It is structured to serve artists at various stages of development, from those applying foundational knowledge to advanced students exploring profound expressive concepts.\n\nPhase 1: Project Proposal & Private Consultation: All students submit a project proposal. You will meet individually and privately with the instructor to define the scope, set challenging yet achievable goals based on your current skill level, and create a comprehensive roadmap for the duration of the course. This ensures a productive and focused experience, regardless of whether you are a recent beginner or an advanced painter.\n\nPhase 2: Weekly Problem-Solving Studio: You work independently on your project, benefiting from the structure of a studio environment. The instructor conducts weekly, dedicated review time, providing customized guidance. This support scales precisely to your needs, ensuring you receive the appropriate technical advice to overcome obstacles specific to your project and your level of experience.\n\nIntegration with The Chromatic Voice \\(taught on Monday mornings\\): This course is the essential practical partner, ensuring that both foundational knowledge and advanced conceptual exploration are successfully translated into realized, high-quality paintings. Prerequisite: Students must have completed at least one introductory course in oil painting or demonstrate equivalent foundational knowledge \\(e.g., knowledge of basic setup, brush cleaning, and layering principles\\).\n\nMembership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any purchase over $40.

Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.",

Designed for makers with basic sewing experience, this class guides you through constructing a stylized horse charm using felt or vinyl, with the option to hand sew or use a sewing machine—your choice. Participants can personalize their design by choosing between a saddle-style detail for a classic equestrian feel or wings for a more whimsical, mythical take. With this year carrying a special spotlight on the horse, it’s the perfect moment to stitch up a charm that feels both timely and personal. Whether you lean classic or quirky, you’ll leave with a cute, eye-catching piece that adds instant personality to any bag. All materials are included.",

    "description": "Join the Laguna de Santa Rosa Foundation in welcoming artist and marine conservation advocate Firuze Gokce for an inspiring talk that blends art, science, and storytelling. In this presentation, Firuze shares her creative process of transforming whale songs, spectrograms, and real marine research into vibrant visual art. Through the true stories of individual whales and the scientific discoveries behind her pieces, she explores how storytelling can spark emotional connection and drive conservation action. This talk invites audiences to listen more deeply to the ocean, understand the lives of the whales who inhabit it, and discover the power of art as a voice for the natural world.\n\nFiruze Gokce reached a significant milestone with the debut of her first solo art exhibition on May 23rd, showcasing her \"Whale Sounds on a Canvas\" collection. This exhibition featured her prints and immersive videos that blended visual art with the auditory experience of whale songs, offering a multi-sensory exploration of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally, her piece \"Brave Little Hunter\" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island, highlighting her ability to convey the emotional depth of the natural world. Firuze was also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in October 2024, further solidifying her place in the art community. Her artwork “Diving into the Depths of the Ocean” received an “Honorary Mention Award” from the Marine Society of Artists.\n\nGuests are welcome to arrive early and enjoy Firuze Gokce’s art exhibit, Whale Sounds on a Canvas II, currently on view at the Laguna Environmental Center from January 10 – April 24, 2026.",

    "description": "PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books and Read On Sonoma are honored to welcome literacy advocate and motivational speaker Oliver James for the launch of his powerful new memoir - Unread: A Memoir of Learning \\(and Loving\\) to Read on TikTok! Oliver will be joined in conversation by beloved friend and local librarian, Mychal Threets. Join us for an unforgettable evening of literary insight followed by an audience Q&A and book signing with photo opportunities. All event proceeds will be donated to local non-profit and vital literacy initiative,  Read On Sonoma . This is a free event, registration required due to limited seating. Honest and thought-provoking, Unread is an inspiring, hopeful memoir of growth and change - Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational neglect, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approximately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However, at age 32, with big dreams and few tools to actualize them, he dedicated himself to learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliver has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documented his decision to learn to read as an adult, and his struggles and triumphs along the way. Here, he tells the full story behind his journey for the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his experience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us how to be better, more empathetic people. In just 365 days, Oliver went from barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal of finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us that words and stories have power, and that, no matter our past, it's never too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal trainer, motivational speaker, literacy activist, and influencer. He has been featured in or on Today, NPR, Jennifer Hudson Show, Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, Rachael Ray, and ABC News, among many others. Additionally, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Literacy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa, California. Mychal Threets is a librarian, literary ambassador, and the library's number one fan \\(according to himself, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-school kid and grew up in Fairfield, CA, right between Sacramento and San Francisco. Online, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people that their mental health always matters, and he encourages everyone to know they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself, Mychal is proud to serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/26\\) is his first book. His cats, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barlow, did not help at all, but he still appreciates them. Read On Sonoma a dedicated group of professionals, educators and volunteers promoting literacy within our elementary schools. Donate directly, meet the Executive team, and learn more about the tremendous work that they do by joining us that evening. For more information, please visit their  website . Praise: \"Unread feels like both story and concordance, a good read and a great resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But mostly, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in order to enunciate resilience, one must learn the phonetics of desire, survival, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel.\" -Jason Reynolds, New York Times bestselling author of the Track series \"An inspiring and deeply human story about resilience, courage, and the transformative power of literacy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey, shared with millions online, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late to learn, to dream, and to rewrite your own story.\" -Andrew Roberts, President, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy \"Oliver James is a big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . He's the living, breathing, thriving example of what reading can do for a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel, there are quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he went through-but if their parents, educators, and leaders would read this memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them, too. This raw, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has been through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth.\" -I. C. Robledo, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By \"Unread isn't just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of our own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver James is a role model for us all.\" -Kelley Coleman, author of Everything No One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child \"A thoughtful and inspiring story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading helps to change lives.\" -Kirkus",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

    "description": "We said we were a community hub, right? We said we bring Healdsburg to life? Well… it’s time to put our money where our mouth is. And we’re doing it right! We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand-up comedy nights with one of the best standup comedians in town (in our opinion, in other people’s opinions, and soon, in your opinion too): Steve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Either way, Steve is back. He’s our main man, living-room ringmaster, and the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an MC for friends’ bands, which eventually led to his first stand-up set - a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants Pass, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead, he embraced the stage as a place for brutally honest, painfully awkward life confessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy, or very, very funny comedy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup - a proud Midwesterner now living in California, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite at The Punchline San Francisco, Cobb’s, San Jose Improv, Rooster T. Feathers, and Don’t Tell Comedy, and performs regularly at clubs and festivals across California and beyond. If sharp, witty, and hilarious is your vibe, Jalisa’s got you covered.\n\nAnd then there’s Ronn Vigh - our headliner. Ronn has written for *Fashion Police* on E! Television and performs stand-up at clubs, colleges, and venues across the country. He still dreams of becoming a weatherman (we support the dream). In the meantime, he’s an avid yogi (when not hungover), a devoted *Golden Girls* fan, and - despite being gay - a lifelong football lover.",

    "description": "Bluegrass, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm, John Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seamlessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time music for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year, with seven acclaimed albums and two Juno nominations, the Jaybirds are simultaneously innovative and unadorned, sophisticated and stripped-down, happily old-fashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance, $40 at the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelchair accessible. Art gallery open during intermission, refreshments for sale.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman \"one of the world's undisputed masters\" of the mandolin, famed for outstanding tone and taste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular favourites for sessions and covers, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded on many other projects, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music with highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller; the duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bluegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary \"new acoustic\" quartet, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit, renowned for highly skilled instrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed the Jaybirds. Of their latest album, Folk Radio UK said \"On That Other Green Shore showcases an accomplished, experienced band at the peak of their powers, with musicianship of the very highest order.\" Peghead Nation called it \"one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017.\" Los Angeles, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 2017. The veteran performer has played with, among others, Doc Watson, Richard Greene, John Jorgensen, Peter Rowan, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty. He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions by Laurie Lewis, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Daylighting the Creek as \"a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the glory days of early bluegrass guitar.\" Chilliwack, BC-based Trisha Gagnon is portrayed by Sing Out! as \"one of the most versatile\" and \"irresistible\" lead vocalists in bluegrass, her strong and distinctive style ranging from \"mournful and plaintive\" to \"hopeful and yearning.\" Trisha anchors what Dirty Linen magazine calls \"gorgeous three-part harmonies.\" She's also known for songwriting, dating back to her early days with the award-winning B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gill and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his own voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contemporary banjo players. \"Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingling,\" said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\), was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015, and Nick is a composer who also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley Station on the new Jaybird album \"showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense of melody,\" said Green Man Review. Spokane, WA-based Greg Spatz is hailed as a \"world-class bluegrass fiddler\" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Audition says Greg's \"virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after time,\" while Bluegrass Unlimited says he \"lays down some seriously fine bluegrass fiddle\" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast, where he's played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield, resophonic guitar master Rob Ickes, and many others including Laurie Lewis, Bryan Bowers, and Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squirrel, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with his wife called All Along the Sea, and is an award-winning",

    "description": "Petaluma’s own Xo Chips Xo makes tightly constructed electronic music that leans toward 80s minimal pop—crisp beats, angular bass/synth lines, balancing precision with a dry, playful edge. \nHalou is the long-running project of Ryan and Rebecca Coseboom who quietly built a deeply devoted audience by writing music that feels like an internal conversation. Their sound blends dream-pop, electronic atmospheres, and intimate songwriting that has resonated far beyond expectations.  \nIdentical Homes is the experimental project of California-based musician and producer Daniel McKenzie, known for his work in bands like The Rum Diary, Built for the Sea, and Shuteye Unison. With Identical Homes, he creates a deeply atmospheric and exploratory sonic world, blending elements of ambient, post-rock, electronic, and art-pop. Live, Daniel is joined by Jake Krohn (Shuteye Unison, The Action Design), Lia Rose (Built for the Sea), and Greg Kelly (Sunset Junior, Fight Like Fight). Together, they trade instruments often, weaving between ambient interludes, tribal rhythms, and dreamy pop choruses.",

Everyone welcome.\n\n**Speaking Horse Class** is offered by Heart & Mind Equine Horse Rescue. This began as our volunteer class and has expanded to serve the larger community. A chance to meet our rescued therapy horses, check out our volunteer program, and learn some holistic horse keeping and equine assisted services (e.g. therapy, coaching, leadership, and teambuilding with horses). NO experience necessary, and both horse and mental health professionals are welcome--truly all are welcome (9+ years old.)\n\nCurious about Equine Assisted Psychotherapy? Speaking Horse is not therapy, but it is an opportunity to get a \"taste\" of EAP because we use some of the same tools and exercises in both settings. So come out out and meet the herd (both humans and horses) connected with Friendly Trails and Heart & Mind Equine.\n\nEach month the class is centered on a holistic horse keeping theme, equine assisted learning, understanding herd dynamics, holistic horse care and training, or how they all relate to our human journey. FEBRUARY THEME: Year of the Fire Horse As the Lunar New Year is in February, we will borrow the theme of the passing Year of the Snake, shedding what is old and no longer needed and embracing the power and majesty of the horse. This time of year also coincides with the horses literally shedding (plan to be covered in horse hair as we groom them.) We will explore how the herd's ecosystem changes as they experience spring and the lessons we can learn from them.\n\nHorse lovers, highly sensitive people, mental health providers, parents, and teachers might especially benefit from this class as well as horse owners/riders who hope to improve their relationships with their equine partners. (Though this work is great for dogs as well, your dogs are not welcome at our horse rescue due to liability and distraction concerns.) Newcomers and novices are most welcome.\n\nCome and experience the magic of working with horses firsthand. Get ready to roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty, and connect with these majestic creatures. Whether you're a seasoned equestrian or just starting out, there's something for everyone at our Speaking Horse classes. Don't miss out on this exciting chance to bond with horses and fellow horse lovers. We can't wait to see you there!",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Over the course of six months, filled with laughter, hilarious misadventures, and the occasional liquid refreshment, these middle-aged women successfully bond and find the confidence to jump start their new lives. Together, they discover lasting friendships and a renewed determination to live in the moment—and most importantly, realize it’s never too late to make new old friends.",

We'll add a little extra this time by heading south on the Coastal Trail when we get to Sky Camp for about .8 miles and turn around. +/- 1 mile of the hike will be on the beach. A little sand in your toes is good for the soul. We'll take a leisurely break on the beach.\n\n**Parking:** Large grass parking area on the right after you pass Limatour Lodge (use to be the hostel)\n\n**Where to meet:** Meet in the large grass parking area on the right after you pass Limatour Lodge (use to be the hostel)\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\nRestroom available +/- 1.5 miles in at the coast\n\n**What to bring:** Snack, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA",

Barbara Postel is descended from Mennonites who lived in southern Ukraine. The members of her family and community who did not leave just before World War I were devastated by waves of repression, exile, and famine. For Barbara, Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine was deeply personal. In 2024, when she discovered there was humble volunteer work to be done in Lviv, she immediately took the opportunity to go and help. Barbara volunteers with Lviv Volunteer Kitchen and the Lviv New Acropolis Cultural Center Camouflage Net Project. She fundraises in support of the Camouflage Net Project.\n\n​This event is free and open to all. \n\nLearn more at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/beacon-of-light-ukraine",

No experience is needed to learn techniques of this dynamic hybrid art that borrows from poetry, theater, dance, hip-hop, jazz, rock, and dance. Spoken-word master Josef Aukee will lead this workshop, ages fourteen to adult. He will guide participants in shaping ideas into short performances and provide a safe space to test-drive word-art creations. Or you may want to just learn and observe. This workshop will present ideas on how to present yourself to groups in whatever spoken form you choose. Bring drafts of poems or begin from scratch. Participants have the option of joining THE 222’s Open Mic Night after the workshop starting at 630P.\n\nJosef Aukee is the author of the poetry collections Town and Country, Where Bright Stripes Go and Hill People, and together with Giles Reaves, he recorded a live production of his poetry show Industrial Strength. His work ranges from meditations and satirical commentary on contemporary urban life to the poetry of place. Josef often colors his live performances with vocalists and instrumentalists who provide dramatic voices and experimental musical backdrops, using spare electronic sounds and pop and jazz stylings.\n\nLiterary - Programmed by Denise Low\n\nTHE 222 / 222 Healdsburg Avenue / Healdsburg CA",

    "description": "American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars, but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity and consistently delivering heartfelt, fashion-resistant music that their fans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa, California, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup were vocalist Mark Tate, guitarist Jim Cassero, bassist Jeff Barnacle, and drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same year when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf night club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest, longest-lasting, most important metal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles and being included on several important metal compilations, Vicious Rumors signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Records, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Varney. By this time, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vacated by Perkins; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for ten years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar, and bassist Dave Starr replaced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut, Soldiers of the Night, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European response. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly after Moomy's departure, but the virtuoso didn't stay long, as he was anxious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind Moore, St. Pierre was also sent packing, and the classic Digital Dictator Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert, guitarists Thorpe and Mark McGee, bassist Starr, and drummer Howe. This group would stay together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up, Digital Dictator, was released in 1988, and as the band's popularity began to grow domestically, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut for the label followed in 1990, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extensive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act, it appeared at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into the spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward trend continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang on: Live in Tokyo, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese tour. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe, the group was released from their contract with Atlantic, perhaps due not only to the band's relative inactivity, but also to the declining stateside popularity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record deals followed, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on through the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next release, Something Burning, Carl Albert died on April 22, 1995. The band decided to continue on, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally released in 1996, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by filling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European base as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-Christ While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent, the guitarist couldn't approach Albert's dexterity, and a new vocalist was needed in order for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Brian O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn, who appears on the 2001 release Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's release, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their ninth studio long-player, Warball, which saw them returning to the more traditional, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings. The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers, 2013's Electric Punishment, and 2016's Concussion Protocol.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Abstract art has the power to evoke emotions, appeal to our senses and transcend the physical world. Abstract expression captures the delicate, elusive, powerful and radiant energies that fly under the radar of explanation.\n\nWe are excited to have you share with us your visions in the abstract and look forward to putting together a dynamic exhibition of work that reflects the power and importance of abstract art.\n\nAccepting the following mediums: painting, printmaking, photographs, sculpture, glass, wood, ceramics, fiber and paper.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

    "description": "Join us for a special event with Gordon Walker, author of Dr. Fun Guy's Passport to Kingdom Fungi: A Scientist's Guide to the Wild and Wonderful World of Mushrooms, Molds, and More. This event is free, but we appreciate your RSVP below so we can plan for your attendance. ABOUT BUNNY AND CLYDE ON THE LAM Learn the basics of fungal biology, foraging, and identification in this in-depth illustrated introduction from the beloved scientist, mushroom enthusiast, and social media star behind Fascinated By Fungi. In Dr. Fun Guy’s Passport to Kingdom Fungi, Dr. Gordon Walker brings his scientific knowledge and love for everything fungi to the page. The first section of this book is written in a comprehensive question-and-answer format. Starting with “What are fungi?,” you’ll learn about everything from what mycelium is and fungi’s evolution and biochemistry to how they are classified and how they impact our world today. You will also find information on best foraging practices and culinary techniques. The second half of this book introduces you to mushroom identification skills and profiles various mushrooms and other fungi, from incredible edibles you can find in the wild to the dangerously toxic, medicinal, and just plain weird. Finally, you’ll find fungal phenomena, showing the amazing breadth and diversity of the fungal kingdom. With colorful and comprehensive science illustrations, mushroom photography, and QR codes linking to resources to help you continue your fungal explorations, this is the perfect portal to step through into the world of mushrooms. “Gordon Walker’s book is fun, yes, and richly illustrated, but at the same time it’s an impressively detailed survey of the fungal kingdom and its fascinating denizens, mushrooms and molds, yeasts, and more.”—Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking and Nose Dive “Gordon Walker’s enthusiasm on the pages \\(and in person\\) is contagious, and he’s a great evangelizer for popular mycology.”—Britt A. Bunyard, PhD, publisher of Fungi Magazine and author of Lives of the Fungi ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dr. Gordon Walker is an award-winning speaker, science communicator, published author, and social media star \\(@fascinatedbyfungi \\) with over 3 million cumulative followers.  He has a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from UC Davis where his research focused on the microbial ecology of wine fermentations, bioprocess control, and yeast genetics. He is a passionate advocate for mushrooms, fungal conservation, and environmental sustainability.  His new book \"Passport to Kingdom Fungi\" will fundamentally transform the way people learn about mushrooms and fungi, serving as the go to resource for a whole new generation of mycophiles and people interested in foraging, wild foods, and fermentation.",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers",

    "description": "NOVATO, CA — Chabad Jewish Center of Novato is launching a new fascinating 4 week class: Jewpernatural: Signs, Spirits, and Superstition in Jewish Belief, a new four-week course from the beginning Monday, February 24.\n\nThe course addresses questions many people are asking today: Do dreams have meaning? Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

This Pop singer/songwriter has toured from coast to coast making waves all over the country. Michelle's 2021 single Come to Me has caught the attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued making music ever since. A pop folk and hip-hop artist whose career has taken her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n\"Michelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Whether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a confident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the stage before wielding her violin in classic rock goddess mode. Michelle Lambert is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!\"\n\n-Dennis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influences when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emotional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishes in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian",

In 2012, Craig released his long awaited sophomore album, About Time, which further explored his diverse music background through instrumentation, including pedal steel, banjo and lap steel. While Craig is best known as a solo singer/songwriter, he also tours as a one man jukebox of country, pop and rock tunes from the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s, bringing people to their feet with songs that defined an entire generation.",

    "description": "FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWhy Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stressed out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyond Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Made plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something still isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the right things” — in life, work, business, leadership, or creative endeavors — but feel stuck, stalled, or quietly frustrated underneath it all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But because there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when confidence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up responsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progress without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) through uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of real-world experience — not theory, hype, or hustle culture.\n\nEverything you’ll hear has been lived, tested, failed at, adjusted, and practiced in real careers, real leadership roles, and real life.\n\nWHAT THIS WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a practical, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in planning and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t come first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How small, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited to slow down, get honest, and reconnect with what actually matters right now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about what you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop waiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willingness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed sense of direction\n\n• One honest, doable next step forward\n\n• A practical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretending.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell is an Inspirational Author, Teacher, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Coach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experience.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(and its companion workbook\\), Morning Motivation, and Chill.\n\nHis work is grounded, practical, and focused on real change — without hype, dogma, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TAKE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready, this workshop opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals and changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.",

They have been great contributors and carriers of the lineage and yet have too often remained hidden beneath the surface of history. Their stories are fierce, resilient, and revolutionary. Do you know them?\n\nFrom the first Buddhist nuns who challenged the norms of their time, to modern-day teachers, mothers, activists, and visionaries reshaping spiritual life today, women have always been keystones to the continuation of the Dharma. This benefit event invites all genders to step into that legacy—to see, honor, and draw strength from the women who have shaped the Dharma with their courage and uncompromising truth.\n\nTogether with an inspiring group of contemporary Dharma teachers, we’ll explore these stories and ask: What guidance do these spiritual ancestors offer us now—when clarity, groundedness, and collective courage are so urgently needed?",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typically painterly in effect, made by applying or painting ink to an historically, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to acrylic or a gel plate, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing processes, mono-printing creates one final image.  However, it is possible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final image - but it is its own image, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn this class, we will use the idea of experimenting, and using drawing, tracing, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  These found materials create all kinds of markings, shapes and images - as they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the stencils and create openings for more texture, shapes, and imagery to create layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling back the paper for the look, it is the surprise element that keeps me coming back to this process.  This process also works well with other printmaking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut into shapes and images, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images.  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing, they might even be considered poetic.",

    "description": "With more than 50 years of experience and five advanced degrees, Dr. Maria is known worldwide as a medical intuitive, channel, empath, teacher, and Lakota/Diné Traditional Elder.\n\nDuring this time of great upheaval in our world, and specifically in our country, the environments we live in and create for ourselves can have dramatic impacts on our cellular healing and processing. Dr. Maria Michael will talk about how climate change, social justice and our environments impact our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. She will talk about the importance of self care, focusing on the most impacted organs, how to recognize what is needed, and ways in which to support yourself, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally. She will focus on herbal medicine and other somatic and ancient methods to support the immune system. There will be time for an open dialogue with the audience and to answer questions. What makes this evening especially powerful is that it takes place within the amplified bioenergetic field of the EESystem. As Dr. Maria speaks about cellular resonance, coherence, and restoring balance, guests will simultaneously be immersed in a scalar-energy environment designed to support optimal cellular communication and energetic harmony. The experience becomes more than a lecture — it becomes embodied learning.\n\nThis event offers a welcoming introduction to Dr. Maria’s work. For those who feel called to go deeper, Dr Maria will hold on March 15th a group healing circle ceremony/workshop. It is a guided interactive process, in which each participant will experience a variety of techniques using light, sound, touch, energy and ancient wisdom healing techniques. Whether you are new to her work or already familiar with energy-based healing, this evening is an invitation to explore what becomes possible when wisdom, frequency, and intention align. We look forward to welcoming you into the field.\n\nAbout Dr Maria Michael\n\nDr. Maria D. Michael is a world renowned and respected medical intuitive, channel, empath, healer, psychic and teacher for over 40 years. She has been awarded 5 advanced degrees \\(all Summa Cum Laude\\), including a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. She has doctorate-level training in Neuropsychology and Special Education and extensive post-doctoral studies in Psychoanalysis and Jungian Psychology. Additionally, Dr. Michael is trained and experienced in EMDR, Hypnotherapy, LENS Neurofeedback, Neurolinguistic Programming, Eriksonian Hypnosis Training. She is a Lakota/Diné \\(Navajo\\) Traditional elder, has participated in and led traditional Native ceremonies and doctored alongside Lakota Medicine people. She has been sought out worldwide for her powerful Medicine Energies and Healing abilities.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nDr. Maria Michael believes that we all come from the same Creation, and that everyone has the potential and capacity to communicate with Creation. While the Lakota call Creation “The Great Mystery,” other traditions may refer to Creation, with names such as, “God,” “the Universe,” “Allah,” “Yahweh,” “Divine Love,” “Universal Love” or “Cosmic Consciousness.”\n\nWe not only choose our human families, but also we choose, initially at least, our own unique form or tradition of understanding and communication with the Great Mystery. No form or tradition is better than another. Humans are merely attempting to understand “That” which is beyond comprehension.\n\nAll messages from the Great Mystery are compassionate and loving, even though at times these messages may appear difficult. Creation’s message appears to us in whatever way we choose to comprehend it. Sometimes, we are only capable of comprehending deeply sensitive messages that resound in our hearts, and sometimes only strong and “seemingly” shocking messages penetrate our defenses. This loving Spirit guides us to remove those obstacles that stand in our way of becoming all that Creation and We intended us to be.",

All Seats  $25 Hailing from Croatia, Brazil, Seattle and New York City, USA, the Astrid Kuljanic Transatlantic Exploration Company unites four musical worlds, bound by a shared dedication and curiosity for music. Astrid’s instinct for exploration brought her to New York, where she quickly became immersed in musical communities from India and Brazil, Klezmer music, avant-garde improvisation, and electronic experimentation.  She carefully drew from these circles her new band members: accordionist Benjamin Rosenblum, bassist Mat Muntz and percussionist Rogerio Boccato. The band developed a strong connection through regular performances of Astrid’s original music, arrangements of jazz and Brazilian standards, and traditional and popular songs from Eastern Europe.  Performance highlights include The Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., Gramercy Theatre and Waldorf Astoria in New York City, and each performance is charged with interactive improvisation and rhythmic intensity.  The band celebrated their first album – an energetic set of music with rolling momentum – with a sold out concert release party at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.",

It  includes some of her compositions created during the pandemic, with very sentimental lyrics and mourning for the death of her husband Paul Cohen.  Her 14th album is produced by Orlando Aispuro, a guitarist and producer who has collaborated with artists such as Carín León, C.Tangana and Matisse.\n\n \n\nTo commemorate her 25 years of artistic career, the Mexican singer-songwriter offered a special concert at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, which was recorded on a live album called 'Desde Bellas Artes México'\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLila Downs, una de las voces más poderosas y singulares que existen en el mundo, regresa a Europa con la gira mundial ‘Dos Corazones’, en la que estrenará algunas de las canciones de su nuevo disco ‘La Sánchez’, que saldrá en verano, y que incluye algunas de sus composiciones creadas durante la pandemia, con letras muy sentimentales y de duelo por el fallecimiento de su marido Paul Cohen.\n\n \n\nGanadora de un Grammy y 6 Latin Grammy, Lila Downs triunfa sobre el escenario por su personalidad y por las historias conmovedoras que se narran en las letras de sus canciones, en las que denuncia la injusticia social, los problemas de la inmigración y la defensa de las mujeres, especialmente las indígenas y las trabajadoras.\n\n \n\nSu nuevo trabajo ‘La Sánchez’ \\(Sony Music\\), en referencia a su apellido materno, contiene sonidos del norte de su país, hace un homenaje a su influencia materna y narra vicisitudes de las relaciones personales y sociales. Su disco número 14 está producido por Orlando Aispuro, guitarrista y productor que ha colaborado con artistas como Carín León, C.Tangana y Matisse.\n\n \n\nPara conmemorar sus 25 años de trayectoria artística, la cantante y compositora mexicana, ofreció un concierto especial en el Palacio de Bellas Artes en México, que se grabó en un disco en directo que se llama ‘Desde Bellas Artes México’.",

    "description": "Coming off the heels of a lively, full-house record release show at Sweetwater, **Wreckless Strangers** continue their album release celebration with a special dinner show at the legendary West Marin roadhouse **Rancho Nicasio** on **Saturday, March 7,** joined by special guests, including a horn section alongside the six-piece band. The Bay Area sextet is thrilled to bring their signature sound back to the iconic venue. Music begins at **7:30 pm**, with dinner reservations available from **6 pm to 8 pm**.\n\nWreckless Strangers return to their roots with their forthcoming studio album, ***Dirty Souls***. The six-song collection marks the band’s most raw and visceral effort to date — a modern take on the arena rock of the 1970s and ’80s that inspired their earliest musical influences.\n\nThe songwriting is among their most intimate and personal, exploring themes of relationships, loss, empowerment, and perseverance. Co-lead singers **Amber Morris** and **David Noble** function as a single organism, bringing the songs to life with bluesy grit, soul, and humanity bolstered by rock-solid, road-hewn grooves. \n\n***Dirty Souls*** is the band’s third studio outing under the tutelage of Grammy-winning producer **Dave Way**, who fosters a level of depth and organic cohesion that firmly establishes Wreckless Strangers in San Francisco’s storied rock ‘n’ roll legacy.  The first single, \"Dirty Soul,\" came out on January 23 and is available on all streaming platforms. The full album comes out in late March, but concert attendees will have the exclusive opportunity to purchase advance copies of the CD. Review copies are available now, upon request.\n\nVisit **WrecklessStrangers.com** and follow the band on social media for updates.",

Drawing from Forest Buddhist teachings and earth-based awareness, we will cultivate a peace that does not depend on conditions. A peace that arises from being fully present, embodied, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditation, and periods of silence, we will explore the body as part of the living earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than striving for calm, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds us—moment by moment, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to slow down, listen deeply, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace within our own hearts.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typically painterly in effect, made by applying or painting ink to an historically, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to acrylic or a gel plate, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing processes, mono-printing creates one final image.  However, it is possible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final image - but it is its own image, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn this class, we will use the idea of experimenting, and using drawing, tracing, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  These found materials create all kinds of markings, shapes and images - as they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the stencils and create openings for more texture, shapes, and imagery to create layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling back the paper for the look, it is the surprise element that keeps me coming back to this process.  This process also works well with other printmaking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut into shapes and images, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images.  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing, they might even be considered poetic.",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA",

Join us for an afternoon of mystery and storytelling with Jazzmyn, accompanied by middle eastern food and fine wines available for purchase. Settle in and be transported! Free admission, all donations happily accepted.   She writes \"I am nine years old living in Damacus, Syria. My father is on a diplomatic assignment with the United Nations to ease tensions on the volatile border between Jordan and Israel. We are transferred from Damacus, Syria, to Jerusalem, Jordan in late 1955. I came to know and love my Bedouin neighbors. They kindly lend me their only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in the Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beautiful, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and generous neighbors. Ten years ago, I picked up volume number one of \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night\" translated by Sir Richard Francis Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of every young, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volumes of \"Shah Razad\" i felt compelled to continue this extraordinary tradition of storytelling, intended to transmit moral values, by adding my own story: Shah Razad...and the Djinns Who Loved Her.",

The band will debut a new song, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee, available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Society that day. According to Kurt Neumann, the song is a reflection of “Where you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sense of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away and coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is founded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned them an exuberant, loyal, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid 80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages throughout the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The band has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller, and Bruce Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train, Chris Isaak, Warren Zevon, Joan Osbourne, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Perhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and major festival, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest shows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things,” “You Don’t Get Much,” “Idaho,” “If It Makes You,”“Stay,”“All The World,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternative sound has achieved many milestones, including a Rolling Stone Reader’s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987, support slots with U2, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Tom Petty, George Thorogood, The Pretenders, David Bowie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid, Summerfest, ACL Festival and others, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live,” “Letterman,” “Today,” “Imus,” CNN, and ESPN, to name a few. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original series, The Ranch, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent installation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part of their Midwest Artists exhibit.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Simply show up, and I will provide the dance partner, as most students come alone/single. Just bring comfy shoes to dance in and your own water. Class is for singles and couples, alike! Everyone is welcome. We specialize in brand new dancers! Dance with confidence, build community, and learn something new in a friendly and kind environment! If you cannot make the entire series but still want to join a group class, please email or text Jasmine at \\(510\\) 388-5498 to inquire how to proceed/register.\n\nLocation\n\nRoom 110",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Play D&D, build community, and grow empathy through weekly storytelling sessions.\n\nAbout the class\n\nclass descriptionAdventure Gaming classes presented by The Game Academy are held weekly for 2-hour sessions over an 8-week term. Participating players explore collaborative storytelling in a mentorship model using games like Dungeons & Dragons to build community, foster empathy, and support social-emotional growth. Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers",

    "description": "Each month, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one must-read book of poems, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning contemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson, who has been an enthusiastic book club member since its beginning, meetings are open to all levels of poetry readers, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection, My Infinity, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poems investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and emotional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of this collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hilma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction, her radical work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly, Jackson's poems explore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont, where perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a book that questions all that is endless, all that has been thought as limiting, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an American poet and professor. In 2020, she released her debut poetry collection, Moon Jar, and in 2024, she released another titled My Infinity, both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vanderbilt University",

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Students can work on their own projects as well. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, this class covers everything you need to know. You'll get informed instruction on how to begin a piece, from choosing the right materials to selecting the perfect color palette. We'll dive into composition techniques to help you craft a balanced, captivating piece, and walk you through the finishing touches that bring your work to life. Suzanne's artwork ranges from portraits, figurative genre, landscapes and caricatures.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

    "description": "The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Library and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuses on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event, but we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look forward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK \\#1 New York Times best seller! Booklist Editors’ Choice 2015 - Youth! Named a \"Best Book of 2015\" by Time Magazine, School Library Journal, Barnes & Noble, NPR, PopSugar, The Millions, and The News & Observer! Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen. That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he's probably right. Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here--it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters. \"Rowell imbues her magic with awe and spectacle. It's a powerful, politically minded allegory about sexual, ethnic and class identity - with a heady shot of teenage lust.\" —New York Times Book Review \"It’s a brilliantly addictive, genuinely romantic story about teenagers who can’t be neatly sorted into houses, coping with stress and loss and the confusion of just trying to be who they are. It’s as if Rowell turned the Harry Potter books inside out, and is showing us the marvelous, subversive stuffing inside.\" —Time Magazine \"Full of heart and humor, this fantastical tale is a worthy addition to the wizarding-school genre.\" —People Magazine ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rainbow Rowell is the award-winning \\#1 New York Times bestselling author of Eleanor & Park and the Simon Snow Trilogy, plus several other novels, short stories, and comics. She lives in Omaha, Nebraska, just like most of her characters.",

    "description": "Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of legacy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group, meeting to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous, or not-so-famous\\) poets of the past & present who have left a mark on literature, the art of poetry, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male, female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & erotic, political, pastoral & personal, dreamers, ragers, firebrands, sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize, and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interested poets & potential participants, the library will publish this growing list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review, with a short bio & picture, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poets listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from participants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wednesday of each month, we will gather for a round-table review of several poets, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to explore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meeting to read about their chosen poet, explore one or more biographies & several poems, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gathering. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems, then we will open a discussion among the participants, after which that participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant will then read a chosen poem, followed by a discussion, as well as his or her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present, each segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei Codrescu Anna Akmatova Cesar Vallejo Dylan Thomas E.E. Cummings Elizabeth Bishop Emerald GoingSnake Federico Garcia Lorca Hannah Arendt Jalal al-Din Rumi Jessie Lamont Jesus Papoleto Melendez Joy Harjo John Berryman Kahlil Gibran Shams Hafez Katrine O Jensen Langston Hughes Maria Stepanova Mary Oliver May Sarton May Swenson Maya Angelou Omar Khayyam Pablo Neruda Silvia Plath Wallace Stevens Vaclev Pavel V.

You put your name in a hat (an actual hat!) and 10 people’s names are drawn at random. When your name is pulled you get 5 minutes to tell your personal true story. At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.",

States of Anxiety, States of Hope affirms art’s capacity to illuminate struggle while nurturing resilience, empathy, and connection. Biography Storer lives in Inverness, California, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her father worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design, her work often creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Shortly before her death, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the Jewish Museum in New York, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis, Oakland Museum of Art , the de Young Museum, San José Museum of Art, Monterey Museum of Art, Missoula Museum of Art, National Museum of American Jewish History, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC. At the same time, our friends at IceHouse Gallery will hold a companion exhibition of Storer’s Works on Paper. Exhibition dates are March 7 - March 28.

Every second Thursday of the month, this Tiburon-based troubadour settles into the warmly lit corner of Novato's beloved neighborhood pub and does what he does best: connects. An accomplished guitarist and award-winning songwriter, Lamboy has earned his stripes across the Bay Area scene both as a solo artist and as frontman of Pacific Standard, his soulful Americana band. His five acclaimed albums draw praise for melodies that are pitch-perfect and lyrics that feel like they were written specifically for you. At Finnegan's, a lively Irish pub and American bar and grill along a tree-lined street in downtown Novato, Lamboy's intimate style is perfectly at home. No pretense. No distance. Just a strong clear voice, commanding guitar, and songs that, as one critic put it, lift you above the everyday. Come early, grab a pint, and let the music find you. https://greglamboy.com/\n\n*Every second Thursday of the month | Finnegan's Marin, 877 Grant Ave, Novato | Free*",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

Over the course of six months, filled with laughter, hilarious misadventures, and the occasional liquid refreshment, these middle-aged women successfully bond and find the confidence to jump start their new lives. Together, they discover lasting friendships and a renewed determination to live in the moment—and most importantly, realize it’s never too late to make new old friends.",

Papadakis joins 2-time United States Champion Alissa Czisny and skating artist Rohene Ward in a company of ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations that move through four acts; each sharing a story that takes the audience on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color, emotion, and momentum.  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps, crisp footwork, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's 2025 tour.\n\nPapadakis, Czisny and Ward's presence elevates every phrase&mdash;their power, musical instinct, and magnetic connection ignite the audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: athletic, cinematic, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 2026, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance dance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo;THE SEASONS isn't just a show&mdash;it's a pulse, a spark, a reminder that when blades meet music and movement meets heart, the ice itself begins to sing.&rdquo; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be community events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI company. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/cross overs, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. Classes will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and advance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chance for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast members. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show, regroup and get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.",

Speaker Bio: As California Program Manager for Wildlands Network, Mari develops collaborative and strategic partnerships to further policy, road ecology, and land use initiatives that promote wildlife corridors and core habitat protections throughout the State of California. Mari spent her childhood on a farm in the San Joaquin Valley of California and her summers in the Sierra Nevada, near Ebbetts Pass. Her outdoor exposure inspired her to earn her bachelor's degree in environmental science from Humboldt State University. After college, she rode her bike across the U.S. and lived off the grid in Hawaii before taking a job coordinating settlements at a personal injury law firm in downtown San Francisco to gain exposure to the practice of law. In 2017, she attended the University of Oregon and obtained her law degree in 2020 and became licensed to practice law in both Oregon and California the following year. Mari lives in the San Joaquin Valley. When not strategizing a connected California, you'll find her with her dog, Bodie, either backpacking, trail running, cooking, practicing piano, brewing beer, gardening, or sketching.",

What we do not yet understand shapes our view and obscures freedom. What are the processes by which we realize and align with our deepest knowing?\n\nTogether, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep attention, spiritual friendship, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matters in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experience of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and love.\n\nDuring this day of practice, we’ll offer guided and silent meditation practice, Dharma reflections, and time for dialogue. All are welcome.",

You’ll learn techniques ranging from delicate pasta-making to elegant appetizers and classic Italian desserts. Start by creating pillowy ricotta gnudi, those cloud-like dumplings that are lighter than traditional gnocchi, served with a vibrant tomato sauce. Master the art of achieving the perfect texture and learn how to handle the delicate dough for consistently beautiful results. Next, prepare whipped ricotta crostini topped with honey and fresh thyme, an elegant appetizer that balances creamy, sweet, and herbaceous flavors on crispy bread. Finally, you’ll bake torta di ricotta romana, a traditional Roman ricotta cake that’s subtly sweet and wonderfully moist. This classic dessert demonstrates how ricotta creates tender, delicate baked goods with authentic Italian character. Throughout the class, you’ll gain confidence working with fresh ricotta, understanding how its moisture content and handling affect each dish differently. Whether you’re looking to expand your Italian cooking repertoire or simply love ricotta, this class provides techniques and recipes you’ll return to again and again.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

A cookbook book club blends the joy of reading with the creativity of cooking and the warmth of sharing meals. Browse a selection of themed cookbooks every month, then prepare and share your meals for the next meeting! February: French cuisine - A visit to France through classic culinary techniques and fresh, modern influences. From slow braises and buttery sauces to inventive new flavors inspired by global ideas, French cooking blends tradition and creativity in every bite. Together, these methods make the cuisine vibrant, evolving, and undeniably yummy. March: Pie/Pi Month - We will celebrate pies in every form! From classic fruit pies and creamy custards to hearty pot pies, empanadas, samosas, turnovers, and galettes, this month honors the creativity and comfort of foods encased in a crust. It's a tasty reminder that nearly every culture has its own version of \"pie,\" and every one of them is worth celebrating. April: SWANA - April marks Southwest Asian and North African \\(SWANA\\) Heritage Month and Arab American Heritage Month. SWANA is an inclusive, decolonial geographic term that represents the diverse communities of Southwest Asia and North Africa, including but not limited to Arab cultures. This month offers an opportunity to celebrate the region's rich culinary traditions-from aromatic spices and slow-cooked stews to vibrant mezze and sweets-highlighting food as a central expression of SWANA heritage.

    "description": "Reclaim Your Calm: Sound, Breath, & Flow\n\nJoin us for a unique somatic experience that uses the hypnotic, melodic resonance of the Rav Vast drum to bathe your nervous system in healing frequencies. Unlike traditional drumming, the Rav Vast creates a “sound forest” of overtones that helps the mind settle and the body soften. In this session, we integrate: Vibrational Sound Bath: The ethereal tones of the Rav Vast to lower your heart rate. Somatic Humming: To physically vibrate the vagus nerve from the inside out, syncing your breath with the drum. Flowing Qigong: Gentle, meditative movements to move “Qi” \\(energy\\) and release physical bracing in the body. Experience the shift from “survival mode” to “serenity.” Denise will guide you through: Qigong to open the body’s energy channels. Humming to stimulate your internal “calm” switch. A Rav Vast Sound Bath to wash away tension with beautiful, resonant harmonics. Come home to your body. Leave feeling grounded, peaceful, and renewed.\n\nAbout Denise Aubin, MQT\n\nDenise Aubin is a certified Medical Qigong Therapist \\(MQT\\) and the founder of Dance of Qigong. She discovered Qigong many years ago while traveling her own healing path and has a passion for assisting others on their healing journey back to love. Qigong is all about loving yourself and reconnecting with your joy. Denise loves teaching and empowering others in this ancient art form of self healing exercises. Denise received her degree from the International Institute of Medical Qigong and received certification as a Medical Qigong Therapist. Denise has been a teacher and healer for over thirty years.",

Come brave the perilous waters of Point Reyes and join us for a rollicking good time at Point Reyes National Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Please bring your arsenal of sea chanteys, any musical instruments you'd like, and a willingness to laugh a lot!  It's so much fun when audience members lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus, and leading a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea chantey radio station and hear what's out there! Practice lyrics! Teach the chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal, mellow, and supportive, so if you've been wanting to push your comfort edge and lead a song, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather just singalong with the chantey choruses, that's fine too. We always have a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of all levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys, there may be lyrics that are not appropriate for children. Reservations not required. To be added to the notification email list for future singalong dates, please email pore\\_info@nps.gov For more information, please visit: nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/calendar.htm",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**",

Today, thanks to dedicated restoration efforts, it can once again be enjoyed by all who walk its trails.\n\nThe experience begins with an overview presented by Eric Metz, Director of Operations, who will share the history of the orchard and the challenges involved in its revival.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "with James Baraz, MA\n\nSpring is a natural time to reflect on what we are holding on to and what may be ready to be released. Just what does the phrase “let go” mean? Renunciation (*nekkhama* in Pāli), one of the ten perfections, is often misunderstood as sacrifice—something we should do because it’s “good for us.” In early Buddhist teachings, *nekkhama* is described not as deprivation, but as a letting go that supports genuine contentment and well-being, rooted in seeing more clearly what leads to suffering and what leads to freedom.\n\nDuring this daylong program, which includes periods of guided silent sitting and walking meditation, participants will explore how habitual grasping—to thoughts, personal stories, possessions, roles, and a sense of control—shapes inner experience and contributes to stress. Drawing from contemplative teachings and incorporating perspectives from psychology on attachment and habitual mental patterns, our reflections and practices will focus on meeting these patterns with awareness and kindness, loosening unhelpful self-stories, softening the impulse to control, and cultivating generosity. This program is educational in nature and welcomes both new and experienced practitioners.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCherie\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence, strength, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

The name \"Men of Worth\" was chosen from the title of a folk song written by the Scottish singer/songwriter Archie Fisher. Together Men of Worth blend their voices with harmony and support their collection of songs with their varied selection of instruments. They have a very simple approach to their presentation, and in keeping with tradition, remain true to the music and story. Their show is a unique combination of humour, exciting tunes, and soulful, heartfelt ballads. Men of Worth are an international act, and have earned much respect and success in over thirty years of touring together. Performing concerts and festivals, with twelve albums to their credit; Men of Worth continue the very tradition from which they've evolved.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers",

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Students can work on their own projects as well. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, this class covers everything you need to know. You'll get informed instruction on how to begin a piece, from choosing the right materials to selecting the perfect color palette. We'll dive into composition techniques to help you craft a balanced, captivating piece, and walk you through the finishing touches that bring your work to life. Suzanne's artwork ranges from portraits, figurative genre, landscapes and caricatures.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills.

We start at Aqus Cafe and take in the West Side of town, including some of Downtown, the Waterfront and a few of the Historic home of old Petaluma. We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue. But it's the people on either side of the counter that make this place so special.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* Meetup time: 6:00pm (we hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Meetup location: Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pace: Easy/Moderate (about 2.5-3 mph or 20-24 minute miles)\n* Difficulty: Easy (if you've walked 3-4 miles recently)\n* Hills: Mostly flat with a few small and easy to climb hills\n* Optional After-Hike Gathering at Aqus Cafe\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 - 3 mph (20-24 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks. You will not be spammed. If you are, let me know. Spamming will not be tolerated.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\nIt's important to RSVP for these walks. When all the people have arrived for a walk that have RSVP'd, we leave... it might mean we leave early. If you didn't RSVP we are not going to wait for you. Plus, it's just a nice courtesy to the organizer and other participants. Please take the time to RSVP.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nGary\nSCO Organizer",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artist, Tosya Shore, presents Celebrating Women, paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air, a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net \n\nFor further information: Contact: Beverly Bird, Press Contact, at bvdrio@sonic.net or 707-799-1490.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

    "description": "There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feels like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way. His voice is raw and real, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest, and that’s exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Americana; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie, blues legends like Howlin’ Wolf,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe, and master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and connects audiences, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s soft and haunting, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay with you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sound. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness, connection, love, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band show, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOver the years, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless touring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists like Shakey Graves, St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Sarah Jarosz, and Alice O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock, SXSW, and High Sierra Music Festival, but his focus has always been on making music that means something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending years on the road, self-funding his albums, and navigating the ups and downs of life as an independent artist, husband, and father. But through it all, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music that connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real, that makes you stop and listen, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.",

This witty and chaotic escape reignites a turbulent romance filled with both adoration and dramatic clashes, as their spurned spouses, Victor and Sibyl, give chase. Discover this sharp, hilarious battle of the sexes, a timeless exploration of love, lust, and the scandalous, intoxicating nature of human relationships. Michael Fontaine, Stage Director",

Visitors can expect to see original works in acrylic, oil, pastel, watercolor, fiber art, and photography, many of which will be available for purchase. The exhibition highlights the wide range of styles, techniques, and personal visions represented by Oakmont’s artists, making each year’s show a fresh and inspiring experience.\n\nIn addition to fine art, the show will include a lively Artisan Marketplace. Artisans will offer an array of handcrafted items, including jewelry, photography, assemblage art, fiber and fabric pieces, original books, pottery, fused glass, and many other unique small works. These one-of-a-kind creations make perfect gifts and provide an opportunity to support local artists directly.\n\nThe event is designed to be both engaging and festive. Attendees can enjoy live music by Oakmont musicians and appetizers while browsing the exhibits and visiting with artists. A popular highlight of the show is the annual raffle, which adds an extra element of excitement while supporting a meaningful cause. In 2025 more than 50 raffle prizes were generously donated by local businesses.  Raffle drawing and wine reception occurs at 3:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nProceeds from the raffle benefit Art Quest, an organization that supports Santa Rosa students who are pursuing education and careers in the arts. The generosity of past attendees has made a real impact—the 2025 raffle raised $3,200 for Art Quest, helping to foster creativity and opportunity for young artists in our region.\n\nThe Oakmont Art Association invites the community to attend this special event, celebrate 52 years of creativity, and experience the imagination, skill, and passion of its artists.",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artist, Tosya Shore, presents Celebrating Women, paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air, a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net \n\nFor further information: Contact: Beverly Bird, Press Contact, at bvdrio@sonic.net or 707-799-1490.",

    "description": "with Pawan Bareja, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

About Anthony Presti Singer/Songwriter, Anthony Presti, grew up in Seattle in the 90’s during a thriving grunge movement, obsessing over bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam while being exposed to bands like the Grateful Dead and Jethro Tull by his uncles, who taught him the significance of music. He ended up moving to Sonoma County as a teenager, where punk dominated the mainstream. After playing in a hardcore band for a number of years, Presti discovered an affinity for acoustic guitar and folk songwriting and eventually settled in San Francisco where he formed his backing band, The Tusslers. Presti’s style encompasses folk nuances mixed with the inspirations of his rock upbringing. He’s released two full length albums, including his second record in 2017, Existentialism, recorded at John Vanderslice’s Tiny Telephone Studios and is currently working on his latest release due out this year, Different Places, at Hyde Street Studios.",

    "description": "Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation changes.***\n\nThe park overlooks the Petaluma River and San Pablo Bay from the east-facing slopes of 1,558 foot Mount Burdell. The name \"olompali\" comes from the Miwok language and may be translated as \"southern village\" or \"southern people.\" The Coast Miwok inhabited at least one site within the area of the present-day park continuously from as early as 6,000 BC, until the early 1850s.\n\n**Distance:** +/- 9 miles total; out and back\n\n**The hike:**\nExploratory because I've not led this hike and it has been many years since I hiked it. We'll start off on the Miwok Trail to Burdell Trail to the turn around point. At the peak of Mt Burdell we'll head back the way we came on Burdell Trail and then talke the Miwok loop trail to the starting place.\n\n**Where to meet:** Parking lot of the park\n\n**Directions:**\nThe park is accessible from both the Northbound and Southbound lanes of Highway 101. Exit at Atherton Ave./San Marin Dr. and follow posted directional signs to the park.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* ***Give yourself a little extra time to arrive*** and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**Parking:**\nFree if you have a CA State Park pass.\nOR $10, payable by cash, check, or via smartphone with QR code at the parking lot. If paying by cash, look for the yellow fee payment tube at the west end of the parking lot to deposit your payment.\n\n**Restroom**: Near the parking area\n\n**What to bring:** Lunch, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.",

    "description": "Existential discopunk for the people! The Crooked Stuff transmits a hybrid, body-moving, synthesizer-driven sound that’s been cross-pollinated and grown at the sonic crossroads of ’70s funk, ’80s punk and new wave, ’90s alternative, and ’00s electronic dance music. At the core, the music is fueled by a blend of introspective searching and life-affirming extroverted blasts that aim to shock audiences into their own inspired moments of living forward and free. \nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area, the trio (vocals, synths & drums) was born from the unique mash-up of founding members Tom G. (vocals) and John Varn (synths) and their diverse musical backgrounds. Tom’s roots trace back to the Washington, D.C., hardcore punk and new wave scene, which was also intertwined with the district’s heavy go-go and soul sounds. Varn grew up in the Bay Area music scene, surrounded by and mentored by its legendary psychedelic rock and funk players. Together, the two have created a full-spectrum sound experience that continually morphs and blends their wide-ranging influences and polar-opposite backgrounds. \nFans say The Crooked Stuff’s complex sonic formula consistently delivers an undeniable, energizing live-show reaction. One called it “like INXS injected into The Prodigy.” Another said, “It’s somewhere between Gorillaz, Daft Punk, and TV on the Radio.” Someone else described it as “Johnny Rotten hijacking LCD Soundsystem and throwing Herbie Hancock on synths.” All agreed—they were feeling it! \nThe Crooked Stuff… arise, release, be free! \nWeb: www.TheCrookedStuff.com\nIG: www.Instagram.com/TheCrookedStuff\nFB: www.Facebook.com/TheCrookedStuff \nApple Music: https://apple.co/2Ldy0sF\nSpotify: http://bit.ly/The-Crooked-Stuff",

Like our contra dances, there is live music and a caller. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6 – 18.",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.",

We start at Aqus Cafe and take in the West Side of town, including some of Downtown, the Waterfront and a few of the Historic home of old Petaluma. We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue. But it's the people on either side of the counter that make this place so special.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* Meetup time: 6:00pm (we hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Meetup location: Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pace: Easy/Moderate (about 2.5-3 mph or 20-24 minute miles)\n* Difficulty: Easy (if you've walked 3-4 miles recently)\n* Hills: Mostly flat with a few small and easy to climb hills\n* Optional After-Hike Gathering at Aqus Cafe\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 - 3 mph (20-24 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks. You will not be spammed. If you are, let me know. Spamming will not be tolerated.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\nIt's important to RSVP for these walks. When all the people have arrived for a walk that have RSVP'd, we leave... it might mean we leave early. If you didn't RSVP we are not going to wait for you. Plus, it's just a nice courtesy to the organizer and other participants. Please take the time to RSVP.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nGary\nSCO Organizer",

A loop hike starting with a climb and includes: Big Leaf, Ridge, Pond and Creekside trails.\n\n**Parking:** Park in the lot for $8 or free if you have a regional park pass.\n\n**Where to meet:** By the Bocce court (near entrance) at Shiloh Ranch.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**Restroom:** At Trailhead\n\n**What to bring:** Snack, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.",

    "description": "Details Strategies to Manage Incapacity, Family Dynamics, and Financial Risks Creating your estate plan, whether it’s a living trust or a will, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are difficult to think about, such as death, incapacity, finances, and family dynamics. It can be easy to procrastinate, even though these issues may weigh heavily on your mind. We invite you to attend one of our upcoming free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational webinar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them. Our goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs",

    "description": "Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation changes.***\n\n**Distance:** +/- 5 miles total\n**The hike:** We'll hike through a magical madrone forest, take in beautiful expansive views of the Mayacama Mountain range as well as the Dry Creek and Warm Springs arms of Lake Sonoma. A loop hike - Dry Creek, Half a Canoe Loop, North Slope and Bummer trails.\n\n**Parking:** National Parks pass OR $7; day pass can be purchased on-site using a credit card through the Recreation.gov mobile app. Once on-site, follow the posted Scan & Pay instructions. You will need to download the free Recreation.gov mobile app prior to your arrival as some remote areas have limited or no cellular service. For more information about paying on-site, click here: https://help.r1s-test.com/helpcenter?id=kb_article&sys_id=2011ea4a1b84bcd076c1dbdbe54bcb1d\n\n**Where to Meet:** Little Flat Parking (A large gravel parking lot)\nFrom Hwy 101 take Dry Creek Road west towards Lake Sonoma. Go up the hill and across the bridge over the lake. Pay Attention, it's the first right turn into \"Little Flat\" parking lot.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/Lake+Sonoma+Little+Flat+Trailhead/@38.7154999,-123.0249632,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808403d82665bd79:0x90dfb0e61fe4d074!8m2!3d38.7154999!4d-123.0223883!16s%2Fg%2F11f5g02g3q?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIxMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**Restroom:** None\n\n**What to bring:** Snack, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.",

    "description": "North Bay Contra Dance\nOur 5th Sunday series is for experienced dancers, so instruction will be streamlined and the dances will be more complex than at our 1st and 3rd Sunday dances. We expect dancers attending these sessions to be completely comfortable with heys for 3 and 4, dolphin heys, figure 8s, and triple minor progression. They should also be able to maintain their sense of orientation within the set. This is not the time to bring your friends who are new to English country dancing, though we’d love to see them at the 1st and 3rd Sundays.\n\nThe regular EC dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6 – 18.",

Like our contra dances, there is live music and a caller. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6 – 18.",

    "description": "North Bay Contra Dance\nContra Dance is fun, quick to learn, and great exercise. Every dance night has a live band, caller, and a quick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance, you will dance with your partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comfortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\nWhen to arrive: If this is your first time, come 30 minutes early to check in, join the quick start class, and get you ready for the first dance.\nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing right away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group, couple, or single! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: $13 members, $15 non-members, $8 student or limited income.",

You put your name in a hat (an actual hat!) and 10 people’s names are drawn at random. When your name is pulled you get 5 minutes to tell your personal true story. At the end of the evening everyone votes by text for their favorite story of the night. If that’s you, you get $50 and will join the other monthly winners in December for our GrandSlam at the Historic Mystic Theater. Sounds like fun, right? \nTICKETS HERE >>",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.",

    "description": "In Conversation with Inez Storer Moderated by Donna Seager Sunday, April 12, 4:00-5:00pm $15 members; $20 non-members An afternoon conversation about Inez’s approach to artmaking, her family history and the stories that inform her art. There will be time for questions. Storer lives in Inverness, California, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her father worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design, her work often creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Shortly before her death, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the Jewish Museum in New York, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis, Oakland Museum of Art , the de Young Museum, San José Museum of Art, Monterey Museum of Art, Missoula Museum of Art, National Museum of American Jewish History, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC.

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.",

Join us Sunday, July 12, 2026 from 11 am to 5 pm for a fun filled day for all the family. Local crafters, artisans, gardeners, live music on two stages, and an array of local wineries, breweries, restaurants, and fine food purveyors will be participating.\n\nThe Art & Garden Festival will take place on Kentucky Street, Fourth Street, B Street, and A Street parking lot. Event Headquarters are at 20 4th Street, Petaluma.\n\nThis event is free to attend with Tasting Packages available to those who wish to partake in all the great wine, craft beer, cider, cocktails, and more.\n\nNot the typical street fair, vendors are handpicked and will be showcasing quality, creative home and garden décor, jewelry, arts, and more. With over 100 booths of unusual, unique, handmade items, this event has something for everyone’s taste and budget.\n\nExperts will be on hand to answer gardening questions. Figure out how to grow vegetables in tricky Petaluma adobe soil and what makes a garden organic.\n\nWhile parents are eating and dancing, kids can enjoy the children’s corner, with jumpy, face painting, FREE hands-on arts and crafts, and more!\n\nVisit http://PetalumaDowntown.com for more information!",

Instead, he and Mrs. Claus make a uniquely Petaluma arrival - they sail up the Petaluma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Center on E. Washington to the cheers of excited children!\n\nStarting at 11:30 am, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa and Mrs. Claus to arrive! The Christmas couple will arrive around noon and will be welcomed by costumed dancers from the Petaluma School of Ballet’s “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parking lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be available for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\nSanta would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma, but in order to hear from all the good boys and girls all over the world, he will have to be on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun stop there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local shopping. When we all shop small, it's not just for the things we love, but for the businesses we love, for the community we call home, and to help promote local economic growth.
