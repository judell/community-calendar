    "description": "Details\n\n\nStrategies to Manage Incapacity, Family Dynamics, and Financial Risks\n\nCreating your estate plan, whether it’s a living trust or a will, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are difficult to think about, such as death, incapacity, finances, and family dynamics. It can be easy to procrastinate, even though these issues may weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our upcoming free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational webinar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this webinar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:\n\n  * The advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts, and probate\n  * Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims\n  * Most living trusts fail; if you already have a trust, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones\n  * How to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n  * How to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan ($550 value).\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Hopefully weather will be on our side for this one! I think most of the events will be outside. They will have live music, a mushroom market, workshops and more. Restaurants will offer special mushroom-themed menus. Solar Punk Farms and the Russian River Chamber of Commerce are organizing the event.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://www.solarpunkfarms.com/fungifest\n\nAny questions, just message DJ through Meetup. The event actually runs from 10am-6pm on both Feb. 21st and 22nd, but we'll just be there for about 3 hours on Saturday the 21st, unless anyone wants to stay longer. We'll pick a good meeting place as soon as they release more details.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack",

    "description": "Creating your estate plan, whether it’s a living trust or a will, can be a daunting task. Estate planning addresses issues that are difficult to think about, such as death, incapacity, finances, and family dynamics. It can be easy to procrastinate, even though these issues may weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our upcoming free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan. This is an educational webinar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help. The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this webinar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:\n\n  * The advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts, and probate\n  * Protecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims\n  * Most living trusts fail; if you already have a trust, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones\n  * How to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n  * How to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan ($425 value).\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association",

Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Inspired by the natural landscapes of Marin and Sonoma Counties, the artists engage in direct collaboration, applying their respective skills simultaneously to each piece. This approach yields both large-scale and smaller works, which are on view at Usher Gallery from February 17th to March 22nd.\n\nJoin us for the opening reception on Saturday, February 28th, from 5-8pm to celebrate “Collaborative Works 2026”, enjoy live music by Rojo, meet the artists, and graze on light refreshments and wine.\n\nAnna and Barbara serve as co-directors of Connect the Dots Art Studio (CTD), a recently established arts-based nonprofit in Marin. CTD brings people together to experience art through installations, workshops, and events that invite individuals to tap into and express their creativity. By “connecting the dots,” CTD creates opportunities for the community to engage with art, make art, buy art, and connect with artists and creative individuals. More details about CTD can be found at: connectthedotsartstudio.org/ https://connectthedotsartstudio.org/ https://connectthedotsartstudio.org email: art@connectthedotsartstudio.org mailto:art@connectthedotsartstudio.org\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Join us Sunday, July 12, 2026 from 11 am to 5 pm for a fun filled day for all the family. Local crafters, artisans, gardeners, live music on two stages, and an array of local wineries, breweries, restaurants, and fine food purveyors will be participating.\n\nThe Art & Garden Festival will take place on Kentucky Street, Fourth Street, B Street, and A Street parking lot. Event Headquarters are at 20 4th Street, Petaluma.\n\nThis event is free to attend with Tasting Packages available to those who wish to partake in all the great wine, craft beer, cider, cocktails, and more.\n\nNot the typical street fair, vendors are handpicked and will be showcasing quality, creative home and garden décor, jewelry, arts, and more. With over 100 booths of unusual, unique, handmade items, this event has something for everyone’s taste and budget.\n\nExperts will be on hand to answer gardening questions. Figure out how to grow vegetables in tricky Petaluma adobe soil and what makes a garden organic.\n\nWhile parents are eating and dancing, kids can enjoy the children’s corner, with jumpy, face painting, FREE hands-on arts and crafts, and more!\n\nVisit http://PetalumaDowntown.com for more information!\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association",

Instead, he and Mrs. Claus make a uniquely Petaluma arrival - they sail up the Petaluma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Center on E. Washington to the cheers of excited children!\n\nStarting at 11:30 am, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa and Mrs. Claus to arrive! The Christmas couple will arrive around noon and will be welcomed by costumed dancers from the Petaluma School of Ballet’s “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parking lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be available for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\nSanta would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma, but in order to hear from all the good boys and girls all over the world, he will have to be on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun stop there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local shopping. When we all shop small, it's not just for the things we love, but for the businesses we love, for the community we call home, and to help promote local economic growth.
