Every dance night has a live band, caller, and a quick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance, you will dance with your partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comfortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\nWhen to arrive: If this is your first time, come 30 minutes early to check in, join the quick start class, and get you ready for the first dance.\nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing right away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group, couple, or single! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: *Free to first-time dancers*. $13 members, $15 non-members, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Like our contra dances, there is live music and a caller. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6 – 18.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

Every dance night has a live band, caller, and a quick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance, you will dance with your partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comfortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\nWhen to arrive: If this is your first time, come 30 minutes early to check in, join the quick start class, and get you ready for the first dance.\nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing right away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group, couple, or single! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: $13 members, $15 non-members, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "North Bay Contra Dance\nContra Dance is fun, quick to learn, and great exercise. Every dance night has a live band, caller, and a quick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance, you will dance with your partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comfortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\nWhen to arrive: If this is your first time, come 30 minutes early to check in, join the quick start class, and get you ready for the first dance.\nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing right away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group, couple, or single! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: *Free to first-time dancers*. $13 members, $15 non-members, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

We start at Aqus Cafe and take in the West Side of town, including some of Downtown, the Waterfront and a few of the Historic home of old Petaluma. We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue. But it's the people on either side of the counter that make this place so special.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* Meetup time: 6:00pm (we hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Meetup location: Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pace: Easy/Moderate (about 2.5-3 mph or 20-24 minute miles)\n* Difficulty: Easy (if you've walked 3-4 miles recently)\n* Hills: Mostly flat with a few small and easy to climb hills\n* Optional After-Hike Gathering at Aqus Cafe\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 - 3 mph (20-24 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today!

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "Santa's Riverboat Arrival\n\nSaturday, November 28, 2026\n\n11:30am - 1:30pm at River Plaza Shopping Center\n\nSanta and Mrs. Claus are coming to town on November 28, the Saturday after Thanksgiving!\n\nWhen Santa arrives in Petaluma, he leaves his sleigh at home. Instead, he and Mrs. Claus make a uniquely Petaluma arrival - they sail up the Petaluma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Center on E. Washington to the cheers of excited children!\n\nStarting at 11:30 am, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa and Mrs. Claus to arrive! The Christmas couple will arrive around noon and will be welcomed by costumed dancers from the Petaluma School of Ballet’s “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parking lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be available for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\nSanta would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma, but in order to hear from all the good boys and girls all over the world, he will have to be on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun stop there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local shopping. When we all shop small, it's not just for the things we love, but for the businesses we love, for the community we call home, and to help promote local economic growth.
