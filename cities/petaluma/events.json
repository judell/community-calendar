    "description": "Jim Kweskin with Suzy Thompson and Matthew Berlin Saturday February 14 at 7:30pm A night of folk music with Jim Kweskin, featuring Suzy Thompson on fiddle &amp; Matt Berlin on bass. Kweskin is the founder of the legendary 1960s Jim Kweskin Jug Band with Fritz Richmond, Geoff Muldaur, Maria Muldaur, Mel Lyman and Bruno Wolfe. During the five years they were together, they successfully transformed the sounds of pre-World War II rural music into a springboard for their good-humored performances. Their imitators were legion, including a San Francisco jug band that became the Grateful Dead, a Los Angeles jug band that became the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and a New York jug band that became the Lovin' Spoonful. No other group attained their unique blend of youthful energy and antiquarian expertise, tight musicianship, loose camaraderie, and infectious swing. These days Jim is best known as a singer and bandleader, but he also created one of the bedrock guitar styles of the folk revival, adapting the ragtime-blues fingerpicking of artists like Mississippi John Hurt and Pink Anderson to the more complex chords of pop and jazz. He has maintained a remarkably consistent musical vision since his jug band days, continuing to explore traditional folk and blues with the sophisticated sensibility of a jazz musician, and jazz with the communal simplicity of a folk artist. He has recorded many solo ventures, as a member of the U and I band, with band-mate Geoff Muldaur, with Samoa Wilson, with The Texas Sheiks as well as performing and recording with a wide variety of well-known musicians such as Maria Muldaur, John Sebastian, David Grisman, Cindy Cashdollar, Happy Traum, Meredith Axelrod, Juli Crockett and Samoa Wilson, to name a few.\n\nSource: Mercury Theater",

Uniquely different from working with stable store-bought art materials, making handmade color is dynamic and surprising, offering an environmentally sound approach to artmaking while also forming a deeper connection to place. During the class, Lena will share about her experience generating colors with plants and fungi during her residency at the Eames Ranch and relay the fundamentals of the process: from foraging and gathering, to extracting color into paint. Participants will create several color charts as well as learn how to adjust hues with a variety of additives, documenting the process along the way and taking recipes home for future experimentation. As a longtime teacher of color theory, Lena will weave broader context into the workshop, sharing a brief history of paint-making and the phenomenon behind our perception of colors in interaction, looking at the subject through multiple lenses of art, craft, science, design and environmentalism. All materials will be supplied and are included in the workshop fee. THIS WORKSHOP IS SOLD OUT Please note that photography and video recording may take place during this event.

Their work was wide-ranging, spanning furniture, architecture, film, exhibition design and more, with every project grounded in rigor, joy, and a meticulous commitment to make things better.&nbsp;\n\nSource: Petaluma Arts Center",

    "description": "Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation changes.***\n\nThe park overlooks the Petaluma River and San Pablo Bay from the east-facing slopes of 1,558 foot Mount Burdell. The name \"olompali\" comes from the Miwok language and may be translated as \"southern village\" or \"southern people.\" The Coast Miwok inhabited at least one site within the area of the present-day park continuously from as early as 6,000 BC, until the early 1850s.\n\n**Distance:** +/- 9 miles total; out and back\n\n**The hike:**\nExploratory because I've not led this hike and it has been many years since I hiked it. We'll start off on the Miwok Trail to Burdell Trail to the turn around point. At the peak of Mt Burdell we'll head back the way we came on Burdell Trail and then talke the Miwok loop trail to the starting place.\n\n**Where to meet:** Parking lot of the park\n\n**Directions:**\nThe park is accessible from both the Northbound and Southbound lanes of Highway 101. Exit at Atherton Ave./San Marin Dr. and follow posted directional signs to the park.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* ***Give yourself a little extra time to arrive*** and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**Parking:**\nFree if you have a CA State Park pass.\nOR $10, payable by cash, check, or via smartphone with QR code at the parking lot. If paying by cash, look for the yellow fee payment tube at the west end of the parking lot to deposit your payment.\n\n**Restroom**: Near the parking area\n\n**What to bring:** Lunch, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.\n\nSource: Meetup Mindfull Hikes",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.\n\nSource: Meetup Mindfull Hikes",

Hopefully weather will be on our side for this one! I think most of the events will be outside. They will have live music, a mushroom market, workshops and more. Restaurants will offer special mushroom-themed menus. Solar Punk Farms and the Russian River Chamber of Commerce are organizing the event.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://www.solarpunkfarms.com/fungifest\n\nAny questions, just message DJ through Meetup. The event actually runs from 10am-6pm on both Feb. 21st and 22nd, but we'll just be there for about 3 hours on Saturday the 21st, unless anyone wants to stay longer. We'll pick a good meeting place as soon as they release more details.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sonoma-Marin Brat Pack",

    "description": "North Bay Contra Dance\nEnglish country dancing is done in long lines (like contra), circles, or in geometric sets (squares, triangles). Like our contra dances, there is live music and a caller. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6 – 18.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

We start at Aqus Cafe and take in the West Side of town, including some of Downtown, the Waterfront and a few of the Historic home of old Petaluma. We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue. But it's the people on either side of the counter that make this place so special.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* Meetup time: 6:00pm (we hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Meetup location: Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pace: Easy/Moderate (about 2.5-3 mph or 20-24 minute miles)\n* Difficulty: Easy (if you've walked 3-4 miles recently)\n* Hills: Mostly flat with a few small and easy to climb hills\n* Optional After-Hike Gathering at Aqus Cafe\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 - 3 mph (20-24 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks. You will not be spammed. If you are, let me know. Spamming will not be tolerated.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\nIt's important to RSVP for these walks. When all the people have arrived for a walk that have RSVP'd, we leave... it might mean we leave early. If you didn't RSVP we are not going to wait for you. Plus, it's just a nice courtesy to the organizer and other participants. Please take the time to RSVP.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nGary\nSCO Organizer\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

    "description": "Mindfull Hikes\n***Please be in good enough shape to hike at a moderate/fast steady pace (+/-2.5 mph) and comfortable with elevation changes.***\n\nCelebrating the end of the day with a hike to Lake Ilsanjo.\n\n**Distance:** +/- 5 miles total\n**The hike:** A lollipop hike that includes Canyon, Lake (around the lake) and Spring Trails. There are some hills to climb on this hike.\n\n**Parking:** Street parking on Parktrail Drive\n\n**Where to Meet:** Intersection of Parktrail Drive and Comfrey Place on the sidewalk.\n\n*Please be on time. We’ll start promptly at the start time listed.* Give yourself a little extra time to arrive and get situated so that you’re part of the opening circle as this is an essential part of our time together.\n\n**What to bring:** Snack, water, hat, good hiking shoes, a joyful spirit and laughter. Please dress appropriately for the weather that day. Layers of clothing are always advisable.\n**===================================**\n**Reminders:**\nMindful hikes are intended to be a way to connect more fully with ourselves, each other and with the land. There will be two periods of silent walking throughout the hike to allow the senses to be fully alive and felt. There will also be time during the hike to visit and connect with each other. These times of talking and connecting are an invitation to bring mindfulness to the present moment. **It's a time to put away the cell phone and cameras to disengage from technology to be fully present with each other, our *senses and the land we are inhabiting.***\n\n***If you're on the waitlist for the hike and want to attend please message Vickie a few days before the scheduled hike. Most hikes have people drop off at the last minute and it's possible there is an opening.***\n\n**Dāna**\nIn the spirit of the Buddhist tradition mindful hikes are offered as a dāna based event. Rick Hansen says “generosity is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of ‘self’ and ripples out into the world to touch many people.” The dāna practice is **heart centered** and in the spirit of generosity. Venmo or cash is graciously accepted. Venmo account is: @vickieix8; last four digits 4714 of my phone # if asked.\n\n**No-Show Policy:** Please cancel at least 24 hours before the start of the hike. Be mindful that there may be a waitlist. If your plans change and you're not coming, opening up a spot 4-5 days before the hike it's more likely someone will be able to attend than if you cancel at the last minute. You're considered a no-show if you cancel at the last minute. Members with 2 no-shows are removed from the group.\n\nSource: Meetup Mindfull Hikes",

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "Petaluma’s own Xo Chips Xo makes tightly constructed electronic music that leans toward 80s minimal pop—crisp beats, angular bass/synth lines, balancing precision with a dry, playful edge. \nHalou is the long-running project of Ryan and Rebecca Coseboom who quietly built a deeply devoted audience by writing music that feels like an internal conversation. Their sound blends dream-pop, electronic atmospheres, and intimate songwriting that has resonated far beyond expectations.  \nIdentical Homes is the experimental project of California-based musician and producer Daniel McKenzie, known for his work in bands like The Rum Diary, Built for the Sea, and Shuteye Unison. With Identical Homes, he creates a deeply atmospheric and exploratory sonic world, blending elements of ambient, post-rock, electronic, and art-pop. Live, Daniel is joined by Jake Krohn (Shuteye Unison, The Action Design), Lia Rose (Built for the Sea), and Greg Kelly (Sunset Junior, Fight Like Fight). Together, they trade instruments often, weaving between ambient interludes, tribal rhythms, and dreamy pop choruses.\n\nSource: The Big Easy",

Like our contra dances, there is live music and a caller. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing.\n\nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6 – 18.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

Every dance night has a live band, caller, and a quick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance, you will dance with your partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comfortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\nWhen to arrive: If this is your first time, come 30 minutes early to check in, join the quick start class, and get you ready for the first dance.\nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing right away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group, couple, or single! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: $13 members, $15 non-members, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

Embracing a panoramic view of carbon’s omnipresence, he explores how this ubiquitous and essential element extends into every aperture of existence and shapes the entire fabric of life.

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

We start at Aqus Cafe and take in the West Side of town, including some of Downtown, the Waterfront and a few of the Historic home of old Petaluma. We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue. But it's the people on either side of the counter that make this place so special.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* Meetup time: 6:00pm (we hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Meetup location: Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pace: Easy/Moderate (about 2.5-3 mph or 20-24 minute miles)\n* Difficulty: Easy (if you've walked 3-4 miles recently)\n* Hills: Mostly flat with a few small and easy to climb hills\n* Optional After-Hike Gathering at Aqus Cafe\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 - 3 mph (20-24 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today!

Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

This juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar symbols, stories, and styles evolve over time—bridging the past and present through creativity and craft.&nbsp; “Americana” has long served as a reflection of everyday life and culture, from small-town iconography and handmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. In Americana Reimagined artists reexamine this broad theme, juxtaposing the old and the new, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh perspectives on what they mean today.

Building on themes explored in &nbsp; Americana Reimagined , &nbsp;Storer’s paintings offer a layered meditation on identity, memory, and collective experience in times of uncertainty and transformation. Through her distinctive magical realist collage method, Storer constructs richly textured visual narratives that merge personal history with broader social realities. Her works are composed of fragments—symbols, images, and artifacts drawn from her life and interests. Storer's paintings guide the viewer on a journey through both historical memory and internal landscapes. They balance darkness and light, anxiety and hope.&nbsp; She asks us to reflect on the conditions of our moment. States of Anxiety, States of Hope affirms art’s capacity to illuminate struggle while nurturing resilience, empathy, and connection. Biography Storer lives in Inverness, California, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her father worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design, her work often creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Shortly before her death, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the Jewish Museum in New York, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis, Oakland Museum of Art , the de Young Museum, San José Museum of Art, Monterey Museum of Art, Missoula Museum of Art, and the National Museum of American Jewish History. At the same time, our friends at IceHouse Gallery will hold a companion exhibition of Storer’s Works on Paper. Exhibition dates are March 7 - March 28.

Every dance night has a live band, caller, and a quick start class for first timers.\nIn contra dance, you will dance with your partner but also with other couples as you progress down the line. The figures for each dance are done in a repeated sequence after a brief walk through by the caller. Each dance may last 10 – 12 minutes and then we encourage you to switch partners as the night goes on.\nWhat to wear: Comfortable shoes that will enable you to pivot and slide on the wood floor.\nWhen to arrive: If this is your first time, come 30 minutes early to check in, join the quick start class, and get you ready for the first dance.\nHow hard to learn? Most newcomers will find that they can get dancing right away as the figures are quite simple.\nCome as a group, couple, or single! Our dance is inclusive to all ages and genders.\nCost: *Free to first-time dancers*. $13 members, $15 non-members, $8 student or limited income.\n\nSource: Meetup Contra Dance",

The name \"Men of Worth\" was chosen from the title of a folk song written by the Scottish singer/songwriter Archie Fisher. Together Men of Worth blend their voices with harmony and support their collection of songs with their varied selection of instruments. They have a very simple approach to their presentation, and in keeping with tradition, remain true to the music and story. Their show is a unique combination of humour, exciting tunes, and soulful, heartfelt ballads.

    "description": "\"SONOMA COUNTY OUTDOORS\"\nWARNING: THE TUESDAY NIGHT FITNESS HIKE IS AN AEROBIC, FAST-PACED URBAN HIKE! WE TARGET A PACE OF 16-MINUTES PER MILE WITH ONLY BRIEF STOPS (TO REGROUP AS NEEDED). OUR SUMMER ROUTE INCLUDES THE HILLS IN HELEN PUTNAM PARK (740 FT. ELEVATION GAIN), AND OUR WINTER ROUTE EXPLORES THE WATER TANKS (690 FT. ELEVATION GAIN). IF YOU FIND YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH THE LEADERS IN THIS GROUP, PLEASE USE THE OPT-OUT POINT AT THE FIRST MILE OF THE HIKE! ANOTHER OPTION IS OUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WALK FOR A MORE MODERATE PACE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME KEEP THIS HIKE AN AEROBIC WORKOUT!\n\nNOTE:\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is posted on the SCO Calendar every week. Steve Tubbs is shown as the host each week but he might, or might not, show up to the event. This is, more often than not, a small group of regular, fit walkers who show up on time every Tuesday night to enjoy this rigorous walk. We leave promptly at 6:10 pm from the Kentucky Street entrance to the LanMart Building. So, if you don't see Steve on the Tuesday night you are there, you might see him on the next one.\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike, 5+ miles fast paced urban hike:\n\nThis Fitness Hike includes multiple steep uphill portions in Helen Putnam Park (during Daylight Savings Time), and at the Petaluma Water Tanks (after Daylight Savings Time ends).\n\nTuesday Night Fitness Hike:\n\n* Warning! This is a FAST hike... a real workout!\n* 5+ miles\n* Meetup time 6:00 pm (We hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Difficulty is STRENUOUS!\n* 90 minutes\n\nThis is a fast, evening Fitness Hike that starts downtown outside (on the sidewalk) of the LanMart Building (Brixx Restaurant, Heebe Jeebe) on Kentucky Street. We head west to Helen Putnam Park (or the Petaluma Water Tanks when DST ends) for some beautiful vistas before returning to our starting point on Kentucky Street. This hike is generally the same route and is focused primarily on fitness.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking/hiking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DARKNESS?\nBring a SMALL flashlight. The sidewalks can be treacherous in west Petaluma, and you'll want to see those crags, cracks and upheavals in the concrete. Reflective clothing is also recommended so that vehicles can see you!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 mph (22 - 23 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike nearly 3.5 - 4.0 mph (we target a 16 minute mile, with multiple hills!)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\n\nPlease take the time to RSVP YES when you plan on attending an event. It is equally important to keep your RSVP up to date. If you've RSVP'd YES for an event, we are going to wait for you until the departure time. We leave promptly at 6:10 PM, so if you arrive late you can join us along the route. We typically hike the same route for each hike, and our focus is on aerobic exercise.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nEmail me with any questions by using the \"Contact Us\" link on the left hand side bar of this meetup group page.\n\nHope to see you on a walk or hike soon!\n\nSCO Organizers\n\nSource: Meetup Sonoma Outdoors",

We start at Aqus Cafe and take in the West Side of town, including some of Downtown, the Waterfront and a few of the Historic home of old Petaluma. We walk about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles depending on weather conditions and the pace of the group that night.\n\nAfterward if you have the time, join us at Aqus Cafe for a bite to eat and some liquid refreshment before heading home. Aqus Cafe is a true gem of a gathering place, restaurant, coffee house, and live music venue. But it's the people on either side of the counter that make this place so special.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* Meetup time: 6:00pm (we hike at 6:10 sharp)\n* Meetup location: Aqus Cafe\n* Distance: 3.5 to 4-1/2 miles\n* Duration: 75-80 minutes\n* Pace: Easy/Moderate (about 2.5-3 mph or 20-24 minute miles)\n* Difficulty: Easy (if you've walked 3-4 miles recently)\n* Hills: Mostly flat with a few small and easy to climb hills\n* Optional After-Hike Gathering at Aqus Cafe\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\n* A good pair of walking shoes\n* Water (you'll be glad you did)\n* A fun attitude!\n\nSO HOW FAST ARE WE WALKING?\nThe Wednesday Night Walk is about 2.5 - 3 mph (20-24 minute miles)\nThe Tuesday Night Fitness Hike is about 3.5-4 mph (15-17 minute miles)\n\nHOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?\nSign up with Meetup and RSVP Today! This also gets you on our email list to make you aware of upcoming events, hikes and walks. You will not be spammed. If you are, let me know. Spamming will not be tolerated.\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO RSVP?\nIt's important to RSVP for these walks. When all the people have arrived for a walk that have RSVP'd, we leave... it might mean we leave early. If you didn't RSVP we are not going to wait for you. Plus, it's just a nice courtesy to the organizer and other participants.

    "description": "The Rebel Craft Collective\nWine + tasty snacks + your latest project and a friendly group of likeminded crafters... what better way to unwind? Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

    "description": "In Conversation with Inez Storer Sunday, April 12, 4:00-5:00pm $15 members; $20 non-members An afternoon conversation about Inez’s approach to artmaking, her family history and the stories that inform her art. There will be time for questions. Storer lives in Inverness, California, and has a studio in Point Reyes Station. Born in Santa Monica in 1933 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother, she spent time on Hollywood movie sets where her father worked as an art director. Influenced by stage design, her work often creates a sense of “theatrical space” and reflects her ancestry. Shortly before her death, her mother revealed that she had fled Germany to escape Nazism. Storer later learned of cousins who escaped on the Kindertransport. The frustration of being kept from the truth has infused her work with a distinct angst. Her work is held in many collections including the Jewish Museum in New York, Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis, Oakland Museum of Art , the de Young Museum, San José Museum of Art, Monterey Museum of Art, Missoula Museum of Art, and the National Museum of American Jewish History.

Come join us!\n\nThis is a relaxed, drop-in-friendly event. Come when you can, leave when you must. Newcomers and occasional-comers are always welcome!\n\n**What do we mean by “crafts”?**\nWhatever “craft” means to you! And whatever is portable enough to bring to a wine bar. Knitting, crochet, and other fiber arts are most common, but we have also warmly welcomed people who sketch, color, embroider, bead, and more. If your craft isn’t portable, we will happily ooh and aah over photos of your work-in-progress, or chat about your plans for your next project.\n\n**Health & Safety**\nMasks are very welcome, and nobody will pressure you to eat or drink. If the weather is nice, we will try to sit outside. If you aren’t eating/drinking during the event, please consider ordering some of La Dolce Vita’s delicious food to-go, in order to help support our gracious, long-time venue.\n\n**Parking**\nParking in downtown Petaluma is free, but street parking has a strictly enforced 2 hour limit until 6pm. To park for longer, try the nearest garage:\n\n* The Second Street Garage entrance is located on C Street between First and Second Streets. It's all day parking on every level and a short walk to La Dolce Vita.\n\n**Ages**\nIt's a wine bar, so this event is for adult crafters (though you're certainly not required to drink wine!). We’re okay with babes-in-arms if you are, but this is not the right setting for wee crafters who are moving about on their own.\n\nSource: Meetup: Rebel Craft Collective",

Join us Sunday, July 12, 2026 from 11 am to 5 pm for a fun filled day for all the family. Local crafters, artisans, gardeners, live music on two stages, and an array of local wineries, breweries, restaurants, and fine food purveyors will be participating.\n\nThe Art & Garden Festival will take place on Kentucky Street, Fourth Street, B Street, and A Street parking lot. Event Headquarters are at 20 4th Street, Petaluma.\n\nThis event is free to attend with Tasting Packages available to those who wish to partake in all the great wine, craft beer, cider, cocktails, and more.\n\nNot the typical street fair, vendors are handpicked and will be showcasing quality, creative home and garden décor, jewelry, arts, and more. With over 100 booths of unusual, unique, handmade items, this event has something for everyone’s taste and budget.\n\nExperts will be on hand to answer gardening questions. Figure out how to grow vegetables in tricky Petaluma adobe soil and what makes a garden organic.\n\nWhile parents are eating and dancing, kids can enjoy the children’s corner, with jumpy, face painting, FREE hands-on arts and crafts, and more!\n\nVisit http://PetalumaDowntown.com for more information!\n\nSource: Petaluma Downtown Association",

Instead, he and Mrs. Claus make a uniquely Petaluma arrival - they sail up the Petaluma River on a Lind Marine tugboat and dock at River Plaza Shopping Center on E. Washington to the cheers of excited children!\n\nStarting at 11:30 am, families will enjoy live entertainment while waiting for Santa and Mrs. Claus to arrive! The Christmas couple will arrive around noon and will be welcomed by costumed dancers from the Petaluma School of Ballet’s “Nutcracker.” Santa and Mrs. Claus will make their way across the parking lot to their festive tent outside Taps Restaurant where they will be available for family photos. Be sure to bring your Christmas wish list!\n\nSanta would love to spend all afternoon in Petaluma, but in order to hear from all the good boys and girls all over the world, he will have to be on his way to his next destination at 1:30 pm.\n\nDon’t let the fun stop there! Keep the festive mood flowing by taking your Shop Small swag bag and make the short walk to historic downtown Petaluma to support local shopping. When we all shop small, it's not just for the things we love, but for the businesses we love, for the community we call home, and to help promote local economic growth.
