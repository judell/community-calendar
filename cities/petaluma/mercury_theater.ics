DESCRIPTION:Men of Worth Monday March 16 at 6:30pm A night of celtic folk 
 music with Men of Worth. In 1986\, Scotsman Donnie Macdonald and Irishman 
 James Keigher came together to perform Irish and Scottish folk music\, com
 bining traditional and contemporary styles. The name "Men of Worth" was ch
 osen from the title of a folk song written by the Scottish singer/songwrit
 er Archie Fisher. Together Men of Worth blend their voices with harmony an
 d support their collection of songs with their varied selection of instrum
 ents. They have a very simple approach to their presentation\, and in keep
 ing with tradition\, remain true to the music and story. Their show is a u
 nique combination of humour\, exciting tunes\, and soulful\, heartfelt bal
 lads. Men of Worth are an international act\, and have earned much respect
  and success in over thirty years of touring together. Performing concerts
  and festivals\, with twelve albums to their credit\; Men of Worth continu
 e the very tradition from which they've evolved.
