DESCRIPTION:Jim Kweskin with Suzy Thompson and Matthew Berlin Saturday Feb
 ruary 14 at 7:30pm A night of folk music with Jim Kweskin\, featuring Suzy
  Thompson on fiddle &amp\; Matt Berlin on bass. Kweskin is the founder of 
 the legendary 1960s Jim Kweskin Jug Band with Fritz Richmond\, Geoff Mulda
 ur\, Maria Muldaur\, Mel Lyman and Bruno Wolfe. During the five years they
  were together\, they successfully transformed the sounds of pre-World War
  II rural music into a springboard for their good-humored performances. Th
 eir imitators were legion\, including a San Francisco jug band that became
  the Grateful Dead\, a Los Angeles jug band that became the Nitty Gritty D
 irt Band\, and a New York jug band that became the Lovin' Spoonful. No oth
 er group attained their unique blend of youthful energy and antiquarian ex
 pertise\, tight musicianship\, loose camaraderie\, and infectious swing. T
 hese days Jim is best known as a singer and bandleader\, but he also creat
 ed one of the bedrock guitar styles of the folk revival\, adapting the rag
 time-blues fingerpicking of artists like Mississippi John Hurt and Pink An
 derson to the more complex chords of pop and jazz. He has maintained a rem
 arkably consistent musical vision since his jug band days\, continuing to 
 explore traditional folk and blues with the sophisticated sensibility of a
  jazz musician\, and jazz with the communal simplicity of a folk artist. H
 e has recorded many solo ventures\, as a member of the U and I band\, with
  band-mate Geoff Muldaur\, with Samoa Wilson\, with The Texas Sheiks as we
 ll as performing and recording with a wide variety of well-known musicians
  such as Maria Muldaur\, John Sebastian\, David Grisman\, Cindy Cashdollar
 \, Happy Traum\, Meredith Axelrod\, Juli Crockett and Samoa Wilson\, to na
 me a few.\n\nSource: Mercury Theater

DESCRIPTION:Men of Worth Monday March 16 at 6:30pm A night of celtic folk 
 music with Men of Worth. In 1986\, Scotsman Donnie Macdonald and Irishman 
 James Keigher came together to perform Irish and Scottish folk music\, com
 bining traditional and contemporary styles. The name "Men of Worth" was ch
 osen from the title of a folk song written by the Scottish singer/songwrit
 er Archie Fisher. Together Men of Worth blend their voices with harmony an
 d support their collection of songs with their varied selection of instrum
 ents. They have a very simple approach to their presentation\, and in keep
 ing with tradition\, remain true to the music and story. Their show is a u
 nique combination of humour\, exciting tunes\, and soulful\, heartfelt bal
 lads. Men of Worth are an international act\, and have earned much respect
  and success in over thirty years of touring together. Performing concerts
  and festivals\, with twelve albums to their credit\; Men of Worth continu
 e the very tradition from which they've evolved.\n\nSource: Mercury Theate
