 thony Presti\n\nSinger/Songwriter\, Anthony Presti\, grew up in Seattle i
 n the 90’s during a thriving grunge movement\, obsessing over bands like 
 Nirvana and Pearl Jam while being exposed to bands like the Grateful Dead
  and Jethro Tull by his uncles\, who taught him the significance of music
 . He ended up moving to Sonoma County as a teenager\, where punk dominate
 d the mainstream. After playing in a hardcore band for a number of years\
 , Presti discovered an affinity for acoustic guitar and folk songwriting 
 and eventually settled in San Francisco where he formed his backing band\
 , The Tusslers.\n\nPresti’s style encompasses folk nuances mixed with the
  inspirations of his rock upbringing. He’s released two full length album
 s\, including his second record in 2017\, Existentialism\, recorded at Jo
 hn Vanderslice’s Tiny Telephone Studios and is currently working on his l
 atest release due out this year\, Different Places\, at Hyde Street Studi

DESCRIPTION:Join us for the opening reception of Explorations in Flow and

 his joint exhibition brings together local abstract artists Catrina Walke
 r and Nicole Mathers in a creative setting centered on intuition\, experi
 mentation\, and lived experience. Through layered\, exploratory processes
 \, Walker’s work evolves through gesture\, material\, and time\, translat
 ing emotional and atmospheric impressions shaped by memory and movement b
 etween cultures rather than literal place. Mathers approaches abstraction
  through line as a living force\, using ink and pen to trace rhythm\, bre
 ath\, and inner vitality in a responsive\, meditative practice. While her
  forms often suggest growth or botanical rhythms\, they remain imagined—e
 merging from repetition\, flow\, and presence.\n\nUsher Gallery is proud 
 to present our first show of 2026! Bring your family and friends to brows
 e Explorations in Flow and Form\, groove to live tunes\, and sip some win
 e with us!
