DESCRIPTION:In this kitchen\, redemption is always on the menu\n\nClyde ru
 ns a truck stop sandwich shop\, staffed by ex-convicts looking for a shot 
 at redemption. Despite her callous management style\, the cooks learn to r
 eclaim their lives\, find purpose\, and become inspired to dream by their 
 shared quest to create the perfect sandwich. A buoyant play full of witty 
 dialogue\, Clyde’s is a transcendent story about second chances\, rising
  above past mistakes\, and reconnecting with the world.  \n\nFull of sizzl
 ing wit\, big heart\, and mouthwatering ambition\, Clyde’s serves up a t
 hrilling\, high-energy ride—think The Bear meets Broadway. Helmed by ret
 urning director Philip Akin (The Lehman Trilogy\, Fat Ham)\, an all-star C
 anadian cast takes on this deliciously funny and deeply moving play. \nCat

DESCRIPTION:Bad Indians Book Club\, by Anishinaabe and Ukrainian writer Pa
 tty Krawec\, is a bold exploration of Indigenous literature and the storie
 s that challenge colonial narratives. Emerging from a year-long reading jo
 urney\, Krawec blends memoir\, cultural critique\, and storytelling to exa
 mine works by marginalized voices and their power to reshape identity and 
 belonging. Interwoven with the figure of Deer Woman\, this book invites re
 aders to the edges of worlds waiting to be born. Praised with a Booklist s
 tarred review\, it offers a potent call to rethink the stories we inherit.
 \n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to 
 December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni. Each in
 -person event features readings\, discussions\, Q&A\, book signings and AS
 L interpretation\, while virtual sessions include live subtitles and audio
  access.\nCategories: Literary

  sold-out run of Little Dickens in 2022\, world-renowned Canadian artist R
 onnie Burkett returns with his irreverent army of marionettes\, this time

 lovesick ingénue. Beloved audience favourites Schnitzel and Mrs. Edna Rur

 ragic romance... with strings attached. \n\nLittle Willy is intended for a

DESCRIPTION:Good Food Markets increases access to high-quality\, culturall
 y-relevant\, and affordable produce in neighbourhoods where it is often un
 available. These are places where farmers’ markets aren’t viable becau
 se sales are too low to cover farmers’ costs. \n\nThe GFM also connects 
 customers to local Ontario farmers. On average\, we source 57% of the GFM 
 produce from Ontario\, though this number varies widely with the seasons.

 lovesick ingénue. Beloved audience favourites Schnitzel and Mrs. Edna Rur
 al are back in supporting roles\, and adding to the fun and mayhem\, The B
 ard himself joins The Daisy Theatre cast for a twisted retelling of this t
 ragic romance... with strings attached. \n\nLittle Willy is intended for a

DESCRIPTION:Enjoy a  puppet-powered parody of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nAfter a
  sold-out run of Little Dickens in 2022\, world-renowned Canadian artist R
 onnie Burkett returns with his irreverent army of marionettes\, this time 
 with a sassy take on the classic star-crossed lovers. \n\nBurlesque star D
 olly Wiggler starts the show with an Elizabethan striptease in this riotou
 sly funny improvised mash-up of one of Shakespeare’s most beloved plays.
  All the leading ladies of the Daisy ensemble battle for the role of Julie
 t\, including faded diva Esme Massengill in a boozy interpretation of the 
 lovesick ingénue. Beloved audience favourites Schnitzel and Mrs. Edna Rur
 al are back in supporting roles\, and adding to the fun and mayhem\, The B
 ard himself joins The Daisy Theatre cast for a twisted retelling of this t
 ragic romance... with strings attached. \n\nLittle Willy is intended for a
 udience members\, ages 16 and up.\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits\, Live Perfor

 anent collection between 2023 and 2025. \n\nIn response to a series of rec
 ommendations from our communities\, these pieces actively fill absences in
  the areas of Indigenous textile practices\, contemporary art and fashion 
 from Turtle Island and beyond\, and art that speaks to the diverse experie
 nces of people.  \n\nThese recent acquisitions represent a commitment to m
 aking space for communities who have been absent from or underrepresented 
 in the Museum’s collection. With each new addition\, our collection will
  never stop taking shape\, continually adapting to reflect the human exper
 ience through the textiles.  \n\n\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits\, 2SLGBTQ+\,

DESCRIPTION:Classical music and jazz collide as two of today’s most prol
 ific and compelling pianists join forces to create a unique program featur
 ing jazz exploration\, classical romanticism\, and pop allure.\n\nGrammy A
 ward-winning jazz pianist Brad Mehldau has recorded and performed extensiv
 ely since the early 1990s. He is first and foremost an improviser and grea
 tly cherishes the surprise and wonder that can occur from a spontaneous mu
 sical idea that is expressed directly\, in real time. But he also has a de
 ep fascination for the formal architecture of music\, and it informs every
 thing he plays. The two sides of Mehldau’s personality – the improvise
 r and the formalist – play off each other\, and the effect is often some
 thing like controlled chaos. \n\nKirill Gerstein has established himself a
 s one of today’s most prolific and compelling performers. \nCategories:

 from Turtle Island and beyond\, and art that speaks to the diverse experie
 nces of people.  \n\nThese recent acquisitions represent a commitment to m
 aking space for communities who have been absent from or underrepresented 
 in the Museum’s collection. With each new addition\, our collection will
  never stop taking shape\, continually adapting to reflect the human exper

DESCRIPTION:For over five decades\, we have developed a collection compris
 ed of living objects\, imbued with stories and knowledge of the diverse co
 mmunities from which they originate. \n\nThis collection has been the foun
 dation of numerous exhibitions\, each offering different perspectives on t
 he cultures\, histories\, and artistic practices represented within it. Th
 is exhibition is a celebration of this legacy\, one shaped by countless ar
 tists\, objects\, and communities. \n\nThe exhibition unfolds across galle
 ries that trace the Museum’s evolution from the present day back to its 
 beginnings in the 1970s.\n\nMade by Many is an opportunity to reflect on t
 he Museum’s curatorial direction throughout the past 50 years\, showcasi
 ng the many approaches\, values\, and visions that brought these exhibitio
 ns to life. Today\, the programming\, along with the collection\, continue

DESCRIPTION:The Parent-Child Mother Goose Program® is backed by decades o
 f research\, yet is so simple and natural that parents easily gain skills 
 and confidence to foster healthy relationships and give their children exp
 eriences that promote positive brain development\, which peaks by the age 
 of three and is largely set for life. All children’s early experiences m
 ould their brains\, and the primary caregiver provides most of those exper
 iences. The caregiver’s choice of words\, tone of voice\, gestures\, fac
 ial expressions\, holding\, and cuddling lay the neurological foundation f
 or the child’s lifelong emotional\, physical\, and cognitive health. The
  Program prioritizes families in need of support and is always free.\nCate

DESCRIPTION:Olivier Award-winning director and choreographer Will Tuckett 
 created Pinocchio for The National Ballet of Canada in 2017\, based on the
  19th-century tale about a wooden puppet who longs to be real. \n\nThe hea
 rt of that story is love\, as the fatherly Geppetto guides Pinocchio’s u
 nderstanding of what it means to be human. Tuckett balances the moral aspe
 cts of the original story with heartwarming characters\, magical stage eff
 ects and playful Canadiana\, making Pinocchio a delightful experience for 
 audiences of all ages.\n\nCategories: Dance\, Live Performances

 the genre remains consistent\, the emotional depth and variety of the comp
 ositions\, as well as Lortie’s performance\, will make for fascinating a
 nd a deeply satisfying evening.\n\nLouis Lortie has earned an extraordinar
 y international reputation as both a recitalist and a soloist with orchest
 ras worldwide. Enjoy his program of Gabriel Fauré: Ballade in F-sharp maj

UID:a83df210a385ec45914aa94e9206ee31@toronto.ca
DESCRIPTION:Bad Indians Book Club\, by Anishinaabe and Ukrainian writer Pa
 tty Krawec\, is a bold exploration of Indigenous literature and the storie
 s that challenge colonial narratives. Emerging from a year-long reading jo
 urney\, Krawec blends memoir\, cultural critique\, and storytelling to exa
 mine works by marginalized voices and their power to reshape identity and 
 belonging. Interwoven with the figure of Deer Woman\, this book invites re
 aders to the edges of worlds waiting to be born. Praised with a Booklist s
 tarred review\, it offers a potent call to rethink the stories we inherit.
 \n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to 
 December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni. Each in
 -person event features readings\, discussions\, Q&A\, book signings and AS
 L interpretation\, while virtual sessions include live subtitles and audio
  access.\nCategories: Literary

DESCRIPTION:Two decades after Anusree Roy wrote her hit play "Pyaasa"\, sh

  is arrested for the desperate act of stealing rice to feed her young daug
 hter Krishna. But soon she faces a far greater horror\, Krishna has been t
 rafficked to Delhi. \n\nDriven by primal\, maternal love\, she embarks on 
 a gut-wrenching journey through the underbelly of a broken system\, where 
 every lead is a gamble and every choice is impossible. \n\n"Through the Ey
 es of God" is a piercingly emotional and sharply critical journey that ask
 s\, how far will a mother go to protect her child?\nCategories: Cultural\,

DESCRIPTION:Returning in 2026 we are proud to present our fourth iteration
  of this series\, connecting Toronto with critically acclaimed Internation
 al works that push the boundaries of live performance and cultural storyte
 lling.\n\nThis year features BeyondTO returning artists\, Wayqeycuna by Ti
 ziano Cruz (Argentina) and Mark of a Woman by Chisato Minamimura (United K
 ingdom). These are two visionary artists whose work explores the intersect
 ions of identity\, heritage\, memory\, and the human body. \n\nIn Wayqeycu
 na\, Tiziano Cruz draws from archival research and personal history and re
 flects on how racial hierarchies and systems of domination persist in a wo
 rld reshaped by neoliberalism’s erasure of cultural and collective ident
 ities.\n\nIn Mark of a Woman\, the personal histories and tattooing cultur
 e is explored and celebrated.\n\nAudiences to experience the world through
  radically different perspectives\, each one redefining how we connect acr
 oss cultures\, languages\, and lived experience.\n\n\nCategories: Arts/Exh

DESCRIPTION:Returning in 2026 we are proud to present our fourth iteration
  of this series\, connecting Toronto with critically acclaimed Internation
 al works that push the boundaries of live performance and cultural storyte
 lling.\n\nThis year features BeyondTO returning artists\, Wayqeycuna by Ti
 ziano Cruz (Argentina) and Mark of a Woman by Chisato Minamimura (United K
 ingdom). These are two visionary artists whose work explores the intersect
 ions of identity\, heritage\, memory\, and the human body. \n\nIn Wayqeycu
 na\, Tiziano Cruz draws from archival research and personal history and re
 flects on how racial hierarchies and systems of domination persist in a wo
 rld reshaped by neoliberalism’s erasure of cultural and collective ident
 ities.\n\nIn Mark of a Woman\, the personal histories and tattooing cultur
 e is explored and celebrated.\n\nAudiences to experience the world through
  radically different perspectives\, each one redefining how we connect acr
 oss cultures\, languages\, and lived experience.\n\n\nCategories: Arts/Exh

 nnection. In this gravity-defying universe\, bodies collide and tangle\, c
 aught between beauty and menace — both intimate and unsettling.\n\nMontr

 d high octane circus that magnifies the absurdity of the everyday. These m
 oments\, strange yet achingly familiar\, mirror our own desire to hold on\

 of life lived on the edge of connection.\n\nLa Presse lauds the performanc

DESCRIPTION:Two decades after Anusree Roy wrote her hit play "Pyaasa"\, sh
 e makes her return with her new play.\n\nChaya\, the protagonist at the ce
 ntre of the original play\, is now a spirited young woman and mother\, who
  is arrested for the desperate act of stealing rice to feed her young daug
 hter Krishna. But soon she faces a far greater horror\, Krishna has been t
 rafficked to Delhi. \n\nDriven by primal\, maternal love\, she embarks on 
 a gut-wrenching journey through the underbelly of a broken system\, where 
 every lead is a gamble and every choice is impossible. \n\n"Through the Ey
 es of God" is a piercingly emotional and sharply critical journey that ask
 s\, how far will a mother go to protect her child?\nCategories: Cultural\,

DESCRIPTION:Play Dead invites you into a distorted world where the familia
 r twists into something wonderful and strange. Everyday rituals warp into 
 surreal scenes\, exposing the desperation that underpins our search for co
 nnection. In this gravity-defying universe\, bodies collide and tangle\, c
 aught between beauty and menace — both intimate and unsettling.\n\nMontr
 eal’s People Watching crafts a vivid blend of acrobatics\, movement\, an
 d high octane circus that magnifies the absurdity of the everyday. These m
 oments\, strange yet achingly familiar\, mirror our own desire to hold on\
 , like couples not wanting the last dance to end.\n\nHaunting and exhilara
 ting\, Play Dead captures the fragility\, absurdity\, and fleeting wonder 
 of life lived on the edge of connection.\n\nLa Presse lauds the performanc
 e as “Masterful fluidity\, breathtaking…the circus of tomorrow".\nCate

DESCRIPTION:Returning in 2026 we are proud to present our fourth iteration

 al works that push the boundaries of live performance and cultural storyte
 lling.\n\nThis year features BeyondTO returning artists\, Wayqeycuna by Ti
 ziano Cruz (Argentina) and Mark of a Woman by Chisato Minamimura (United K
 ingdom). These are two visionary artists whose work explores the intersect
 ions of identity\, heritage\, memory\, and the human body. \n\nIn Wayqeycu
 na\, Tiziano Cruz draws from archival research and personal history and re
 flects on how racial hierarchies and systems of domination persist in a wo
 rld reshaped by neoliberalism’s erasure of cultural and collective ident
 ities.\n\nIn Mark of a Woman\, the personal histories and tattooing cultur
 e is explored and celebrated.\n\nAudiences to experience the world through
  radically different perspectives\, each one redefining how we connect acr
 oss cultures\, languages\, and lived experience.\n\n\nCategories: Arts/Exh

DESCRIPTION:Toronto-based artists Bernadette and Craig share not only a li
 fe together\, but a deeply thoughtful and intuitive collaborative practice
  rooted in nature\, material\, and process.\n\nBernadette’s work draws o
 n a lifelong connection to nature and texture. Using paint\, plaster\, pap
 er\, and fabric\, she explores organic forms\, heritage\, and resilience -
  layers that feel both physical and emotional. Craig\, on the other hand\,
  investigates natural processes through paint itself\, guiding flow\, sedi
 ment\, and movement to create what he calls “paintscapes\,” where beau
 ty emerges through interaction\, change\, and time.\n\nTogether\, their pr
 actice becomes a shared exploration\, an open\, curious process where two 
 creative voices converge to create something cohesive\, balanced\, and dee
 ply resonant. What you see on the walls tonight is the result of trust\, e
 xperimentation\, and a genuine dialogue between materials\, nature and eac
 h other.\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits\nFree event
