 e fois construits\, mettons nos fours à l’épreuve\, expérimentons ave
 c différents aliments pour voir comment notre création peut chauffer en 
 utilisant uniquement les rayons du soleil. Cette expérience pratique ense

 ts scientifiques\nSolar Oven\nLet’s embark on an exciting journey to har
 ness the power of the sun by creating and testing our very own solar oven.
  With simple materials\, we will construct a solar oven\, learning about s
 olar energy absorption and heat transfer along the way. Once built\, let
 ’s put our ovens to the test\, experimenting with different food items t
 o see how effectively our creations can heat using only the sun’s rays. 
 This hands-on experience not only teaches about renewable energy and susta
 inability but also sparks curiosity and creativity in exploring scientific
  concepts.\nAccessibilité:\nLe sous-titrage en direct ou automatique\, l
