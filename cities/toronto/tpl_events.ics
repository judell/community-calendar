DESCRIPTION:Les enfants participeront à un cours accéléré de 60 minute
 s sur l'art magique de la marionnette ! Cet atelier a été conçu par Bia
 nca Heuvelmans\, artiste professionnelle et éducatrice artistique.\nBianc
 a guidera le groupe à travers la création d'une marionnette de base en s
 ac de papier qui aura beaucoup de personnalité. Ensuite\, nous apprendron
 s les bases de l'art de la marionnette.\nLa marionnette est un excellent m
 oyen d'enseigner les compétences de performance et de coordination main-
 œil\, et c'est aussi une façon délicieusement inattendue d'enseigner de
 s choses comme l'écoute active\, la conscience de la respiration\, la dis
 ponibilité émotionnelle et la spontanéité dans la performance\nÂge : 
 6-12 ans\n.
