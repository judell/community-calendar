SUMMARY:Logic and Philosophy of Science Group Talk (Sorin Bangu\, Bergen)
DESCRIPTION:The Logic and Philosophy of Science Group is pleased to welcome as guest speaker Sorin Bangu\, a professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bergen in Norway. Dr. Bangu works in philosophy of science (especially philosophy of mathematics and physics)\, with further interests in Wittgenstein and Quine. He is involved in the activities of the Wittgenstein Archives Bergen and serves as a co-editor of its open access journal\, Nordic Wittgenstein Review. \nTalk Title\nThe Odd Couple: later Wittgenstein and Quine on the Existence of Numbers \nTalk Abstract\nThe aim of this talk is to sketch and contrast later Wittgenstein’s and Quine’s views on the perennial\, and central\, question in metaphysics and in the philosophy of mathematics: do numbers exist? Against the background of an example involving elementary arithmetic\, I’ll maintain that they are indeed an odd couple: their views are both very different\, but also related. I’ll argue that one of them (easy to guess who) holds that ‘the question contains a mistake’\, so can’t even be meaningfully asked\, let alone answered — which is disturbing news for both the realist and the antirealist projects in the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Quine\, on the other hand\, contends that the answer to the question is affirmative. However\, his reason to answer so is quite provocative as well\, for it illustrates a pragmatic approach to metaphysical question. It relies on the contingent fact that mathematics is successfully applied — that it is\, in fact\, indispensable to science and everyday life. It is this perspective\, the paramount role assigned to the applicability of mathematics\, that he and Wittgenstein share.\nAbout the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group\nOne of six departmental Research Interest Groups\, the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group hosts talks on logic\, general philosophy of science\, and philosophy of the particular sciences\, as well as talks in allied areas such as formal epistemology\, decision theory\, and the metaphysics of science.

SUMMARY:Continental Philosophy Research Group Talk (Karen Ng\, Vanderbilt)
DESCRIPTION:The Continental Philosophy Research Group is pleased to welcome as guest speaker Karen Ng\, an associate professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University.

SUMMARY:Global Philosophy Research Interest Group Talk (Sayeh Meisami\, Dayton)
DESCRIPTION:The Global Philosophy Research Interest Group is delighted to welcome as guest speaker Sayeh Meisami\, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Dayton. Dr. Meisami has published several books and articles in the fields of philosophy and religion. She is the author of Mulla Sadra (2013)\, Knowledge and Power in the Philosophies of Ḥamīd al-Dīn Kirmānī and Mullā Ṣadrā Shīrāzī (2018)\, and Nasir al-Din Tusi: A Philosopher for All Seasons (2019). In line with her interdisciplinary interests\, her most recent articles demonstrate the significance of poetic techniques of thinking and writing in later Islamic philosophy and sufism\, and her ongoing research is on the continuity of mythological and philosophical discourses in the Persianate context. \nTalk Title\nPoetic Thinking and the Divergent Philosophies of Rumi and Heidegger \nTalk Abstract\n\nThe talk is a critical analysis of Martin Heidegger’s engagement with “poetic thinking” by comparing it to that of Rumi’s. The comparison aims to investigate how a poetic thinker’s historical\, cultural\, and lived experiences fundamentally shape the ethical and sociopolitical outcomes of the discourses they create in their philosophies. I attempt to demonstrate that Heidegger correctly considers poetic thinking as a wholesome conflict between conceptualization and experiential finding that is essential to authentic human experience. This is exemplified by his reading of German lyrical voices\, such as Hölderlin\, that is conditioned by Eurocentrism and German exceptionalism.  I argue that both Heidegger and Rumi are great at poetic thinking and for this reason their starkly different lived experiences lead them to diverging directions:  Heidegger’s poetic thinking unleashes the “will to power”\, and Rumi’s poetic thinking that is grounded in his experience as a multi-cultural immigrant and a lover gives rise to the “will to love.”  I will ultimately demonstrate that Rumi’s “will to love” functions as an interpretive/epistemic lens that justifies his philosophy of unity and inclusivity.   \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems\, new questions and research directions\, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy\, and Chinese philosophy\, Indian philosophy in English\, and classical Islamic philosophy.
