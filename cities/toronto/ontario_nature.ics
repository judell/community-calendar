SUMMARY:Ecuador’s Highlands with Ontario Nature
DESCRIPTION:Ecuador’s highlands are well-situated to deliver a high-impact tropical experience! The superposition of the Andes overtop the Equator has allowed for a massive proliferation of biodiversity as different life forms are found at different altitudes\, and the barrier the mountains themselves form means that some wildlife is found on one side of the mountains and not on the other. \nJust a short drive from the highland capital of Quito lay the Tandayapa Valley and Mindo Cloud Forest Reserve. These areas on the west slope of the Andes are hotspots for endemic birds and are arguably the world’s best places to observe hummingbirds! The trees are draped in mosses\, bromeliads\, and orchids. The spectacular lek of male Andean Cock-of-the Rocks is an ongoing phenomenon\, and the nearby Maquipucuna Cloud Forest offers the chance to observe endangered Spectacled Bears feeding on fruiting trees. \nTraversing Quito southward\, we visit the highland páramo grasslands at Antisana Ecological Reserve\, watching for hardy Andean Condors patrolling the skies with a backdrop of snow-capped peaks. Our adventure continues as we cross to the Andes’ east slope and gradually descend\, delving into the moist foothills around Wildsumaco. Rising slightly in altitude again\, we come to Isidro Lodge\, which is famous for bird and mammal diversity. \nIf you wish to have an even fuller Ecuador experience\, consider visiting the Amazon Lowlands during an optional post-trip extension. \nRegister Here

SUMMARY:Understanding the Indigenous-led Legal Challenge Against Bills 5 and C-5 Webinar
DESCRIPTION:Join us to learn about the legal challenge against both Bill 5 being led by Indigenous communities\, and Bill C5 and how you can support. \nThis free webinar will include a panel discussion from Indigenous rights holders and legal experts about the importance of the legal challenge and how challenging Bills 5 and C-5 in the courts is expected to unfold. \nPassed by the Government of Ontario in June 2025\, Bill 5 threatens the long-term sustainability and well-being of Ontario. Similarly\, the Government of Canada passed Bill C-5 in June 2025\, which also threatens Indigenous rights\, democratic processes and environmental protections. \nYou will hear from: \n\nRamon Kataquapit\, intervenor and founder of the Indigenous youth organization Okiniwak\nMichel Koostachin\, intervenor and founder of the Friends of the Attawapiskat River\nKerrie Blaise\, founder and legal counsel at Legal Advocates for Natures Defence (LAND)\nNicholas Daube\, senior counsel at Woodward & Company LLP\n\nOntario Nature’s Conservation Policy and Campaigns Director\, Tony Morris\, will provide a brief overview of both bills and facilitate the panel discussion. Attendees will leave the webinar with a better understanding of the nature of the legal challenge and how they can support it. \nAttendees will be able to ask questions of the panelists. \nPhoto Credit: First Nations Rally Opposing Bill 5\, Queen’s Park © Greg Noakes

SUMMARY:Two-Eyed Seeing and Ethical Space Training II Sustaining balance in the era of climate change
DESCRIPTION:Don’t forget to register for Two-Eyed Seeing and Ethical Space\nTraining II — Sustaining Balance in the Era of Climate Change! \nDates: March 12 & 13\, 2026\nLocation: Blue Mountain Village Conference Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loss of biodiversity\, natural spaces and relationships with the land due to climate change is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. As the climate crisis continues\, ecosystems\, species and communities are being forced to adapt\, migrate\, or face extinction. Climate change alters the delicate balance established by natural law\, leading to a cascade of negative effects across the planet. The UNESCO Niagara Escarpment Biosphere is home to a unique and diverse communities of humans\, plants\, and other animal relatives\, many of which are at risk due to environmental pressures. G’chi Bimadinaa (‘The Great Cliff That Runs Along’ in Anishinaabemowin) or Kastenhraktátye (‘Along the Cliffs’ in Kanyen’kehá:ka/Mohawk) for time immemorial has been a great teacher to all who live within it. It is time to gather and listen\, and restore balance to our biosphere. \nThis gathering will explore the practical ways in which Indigenous principles can be shared to develop a response to the degradation of balance in nature caused by human actions. An essential aspect of this series is to reveal the benefits of Two–Eyed Seeing and how it can be successfully implemented to create ethical space within conservation practices. With the intent of training Biosphere leaders\, we will explore the pragmatic protocols and tools needed to create ethical space with Indigenous partners in developing effective conservation practices. \nThe conference goal is to create Ethical Space for the engagement of ideas and inspiration as we live within a new ecological scenario exacerbated by climate change. Topics to be featured include: \n\nGlobal frameworks on Two–Eyed Seeing and Ethical Space in conservation\n​Advancing towards Canada’s Target 3 to protect biodiversity and natural spaces\nUsing Two–Eyed Seeing to address the consequences of climate change\nDeveloping Ethical Space for true collaborative partnerships\nPreventing Species Extinctions and Protecting Indigenous Culturally Significant Species\nYouth Response Panel\n\nClick below to see the full agenda and to register:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:The Hidden Life Around Us with Don Scallen
DESCRIPTION:All around us\, some creatures are conducting their lives largely unseen. Who has observed amorous salamanders\, piscine stonemasons\, or crooning tree crickets?  We are more aware of birds and the larger mammals\, but there is a host of animals active underwater or after dark that are seldom noticed.  Others use camouflage to conceal their presence. Come to our March talk to hear Don Scallen share stories and show images about fish\, caterpillars and other animals that slip under our radar. \nDon is a writer\, naturalist\, and former president of the Halton North Peel Naturalist Club. He is a regular contributor to an acclaimed regional magazine called In The Hills. https://www.inthehills.ca/author/don-scallen/  and has published two books: Nature Where We Live and Spotted Salamanders and their world” \n

SUMMARY:Conversations for Conservation: Raising the Earth Stewards of Tomorrow with Jacob Rodenburg
DESCRIPTION:Children across the country are growing up with constant reminders that our planet is under strain: shrinking wildlife populations\, climate change\, pollution\, and habitats in decline. It’s a heavy weight for young shoulders\, and many feel overwhelmed by what psychologists now call “eco-anxiety.” For children\, the future seems daunting and hopeless. \nYet hope is within reach. \nIt begins with simple\, joyful experiences outdoors\, supported by caring adults and rooted in the places that children call home. When young people can explore nature\, feel its rhythms\, and take age-appropriate action on its behalf\, they discover confidence\, belonging\, and their own capacity to make a difference. \nIn Peterborough\, Ontario\, a community-rooted initiative\, recently honoured by the United Nations University as an Outstanding Flagship Project\, is charting a new path forward. The Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship is a practical\, inspiring guide for parents\, educators\, conservationists\, and community leaders who want to help raise the next generation of Earth stewards. \nRooted in local ecosystems and strengthened by caring adult mentors\, the Pathway model shows how simple\, consistent engagements with nature can grow into a lifelong ethic of stewardship. It offers a hopeful\, actionable roadmap for communities seeking to protect the places they love by empowering the young people who will inherit them. \nThis talk will share the story behind the Pathway and explore how conservation groups\, educators\, and citizens can work together to cultivate a generation ready to care for and care about the natural world. \n \n\nAbout Jacob Rodenburg \nJacob Rodenburg is an award-winning environmental educator with more than 35 years of experience inspiring children\, youth\, and communities to connect with the natural world. As Executive Director of Camp Kawartha and an instructor in Environmental Education at Trent University\, he blends ecological literacy\, experiential learning\, and sustainability into innovative programs. Jacob is the co-creator of the Eco-Mentor Program and co-author of The Big Book of Nature Activities and The Wild Path Home: A Guide to Raising the Earth Stewards of Tomorrow as well as the author of the Book of Nature Connection. He co-led the development of the Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship Program\, recently recognized as an Outstanding Flagship Project by the United Nations University. \n \n  \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model. If you are in a position to make a contribution\, all proceeds help us to offer meaningful events and activities for our community to engage with and learn about our natural world. \nVenue \nDuring the colder months\, the Conversations for Conservation series will be held at the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 126 (Preston)\, located at 334 Westminster Dr N\, Cambridge.  Parking is available on site. \nThe Conversations for Conservation series is supported by the City of Cambridge. \nQuestions? Contact Amanda Humphreys\, Events & Development Coordinator\, at Amanda.Humphreys@raresites.org or (519) 650-9336 x122. \n  \nRegister here: https://www.tickettailor.com/checkout/view-event/id/7270328/chk/c351/?modal_widget=true&widget=true
