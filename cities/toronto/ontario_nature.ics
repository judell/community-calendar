SUMMARY:Ecuador’s Highlands with Ontario Nature
DESCRIPTION:Ecuador’s highlands are well-situated to deliver a high-impact tropical experience! The superposition of the Andes overtop the Equator has allowed for a massive proliferation of biodiversity as different life forms are found at different altitudes\, and the barrier the mountains themselves form means that some wildlife is found on one side of the mountains and not on the other. \nJust a short drive from the highland capital of Quito lay the Tandayapa Valley and Mindo Cloud Forest Reserve. These areas on the west slope of the Andes are hotspots for endemic birds and are arguably the world’s best places to observe hummingbirds! The trees are draped in mosses\, bromeliads\, and orchids. The spectacular lek of male Andean Cock-of-the Rocks is an ongoing phenomenon\, and the nearby Maquipucuna Cloud Forest offers the chance to observe endangered Spectacled Bears feeding on fruiting trees. \nTraversing Quito southward\, we visit the highland páramo grasslands at Antisana Ecological Reserve\, watching for hardy Andean Condors patrolling the skies with a backdrop of snow-capped peaks. Our adventure continues as we cross to the Andes’ east slope and gradually descend\, delving into the moist foothills around Wildsumaco. Rising slightly in altitude again\, we come to Isidro Lodge\, which is famous for bird and mammal diversity. \nIf you wish to have an even fuller Ecuador experience\, consider visiting the Amazon Lowlands during an optional post-trip extension. \nRegister Here

SUMMARY:Biodiversity Gardening and The  Restoration of Nature
DESCRIPTION:Many Londoners enjoy gardening\, but most plants in the city are not native. Human activities have harmed wildlife habitats. Gardeners can help by using native plants\, which support birds\, mammals\, and insects. What are native plants? What do insects eat? How can we help birds? By increasing biodiversity in our gardens\, we can make a difference. Dr. Nina Zitani promotes diversity and will guide you in supporting wildlife in your backyard

SUMMARY:Conversations for Conservation : Secret Lives of Cats and their Impact on Local Wildlife with Jonathan Chu
DESCRIPTION:The Secret Lives of Cats \nOutdoor domestic cats are estimated to be highly impactful to wildlife. In Canada it’s been estimated that cats kill 60 million birds per year. While mortality estimates by cats are staggering there are uncertainties regarding what species are killed\, how they vary across environments and why certain cats have higher predation rates. To address these questions\, Jonathan attached animal-borne cameras\, CatCams\, and GPS trackers\, to owned cats in southwestern Ontario\, around Guelph-Kitchener/Waterloo-Cambridge\, and the Okanagan Valley\, British Columbia\, between Kelowna and Osoyoos. These cameras recorded from the point-of-view of each cat\, allowing Jonathan to accurately calculate predation rates and identify prey species. \nAudience members will get a sneak peak of the world through the eyes of a cat and learn what species are commonly depredated by cats in Canada\, how they differ between regions\, and what factors determine which cats have higher predation rates. \nAbout Jonathan Chu \nJonathan is a PhD Candidate at the University of Guelph studying outdoor domestic cats. He has primarily focused on the impacts cats have on wildlife by employing the use of animal-borne cameras that he attaches to owned domestic cats. These cameras allow him to see the world from the point-of-view of a cat. By using these cameras\, he can ascertain the types of species\, and the number of animals cats depredate when they are outdoors. He aims to understand the role cats play in the outdoor environment and what we can do to ensure cats\, humans and wildlife can sustainably live in our urban environments together. Collecting insects and watching birds in the urban parks he frequented when he was growing up inspired him to study Urban Ecology. When not spying on the secret lives of cats he finds any excuse to watch birds. \n \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model. If you are in a position to make a contribution\, all proceeds help us to offer meaningful events and activities for our community to engage with and learn about our natural world. \nVenue \nDuring the colder months\, the Conversations for Conservation series will be held at the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 126 (Preston)\, located at 334 Westminster Dr N\, Cambridge.  Parking is available on site. \nThe Conversations for Conservation series is supported by the City of Cambridge. \nQuestions? Contact Amanda Humphreys\, Events & Development Coordinator\, at Amanda.Humphreys@raresites.org or (519) 650-9336 x122.

SUMMARY:The Hidden Life Around Us with Don Scallen
DESCRIPTION:All around us\, some creatures are conducting their lives largely unseen. Who has observed amorous salamanders\, piscine stonemasons\, or crooning tree crickets?  We are more aware of birds and the larger mammals\, but there is a host of animals active underwater or after dark that are seldom noticed.  Others use camouflage to conceal their presence. Come to our March talk to hear Don Scallen share stories and show images about fish\, caterpillars and other animals that slip under our radar. \nDon is a writer\, naturalist\, and former president of the Halton North Peel Naturalist Club. He is a regular contributor to an acclaimed regional magazine called In The Hills. https://www.inthehills.ca/author/don-scallen/  and has published two books: Nature Where We Live and Spotted Salamanders and their world” \n

SUMMARY:Conversations for Conservation: Raising the Earth Stewards of Tomorrow with Jacob Rodenburg
DESCRIPTION:Children across the country are growing up with constant reminders that our planet is under strain: shrinking wildlife populations\, climate change\, pollution\, and habitats in decline. It’s a heavy weight for young shoulders\, and many feel overwhelmed by what psychologists now call “eco-anxiety.” For children\, the future seems daunting and hopeless. \nYet hope is within reach. \nIt begins with simple\, joyful experiences outdoors\, supported by caring adults and rooted in the places that children call home. When young people can explore nature\, feel its rhythms\, and take age-appropriate action on its behalf\, they discover confidence\, belonging\, and their own capacity to make a difference. \nIn Peterborough\, Ontario\, a community-rooted initiative\, recently honoured by the United Nations University as an Outstanding Flagship Project\, is charting a new path forward. The Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship is a practical\, inspiring guide for parents\, educators\, conservationists\, and community leaders who want to help raise the next generation of Earth stewards. \nRooted in local ecosystems and strengthened by caring adult mentors\, the Pathway model shows how simple\, consistent engagements with nature can grow into a lifelong ethic of stewardship. It offers a hopeful\, actionable roadmap for communities seeking to protect the places they love by empowering the young people who will inherit them. \nThis talk will share the story behind the Pathway and explore how conservation groups\, educators\, and citizens can work together to cultivate a generation ready to care for and care about the natural world. \n \n\nAbout Jacob Rodenburg \nJacob Rodenburg is an award-winning environmental educator with more than 35 years of experience inspiring children\, youth\, and communities to connect with the natural world. As Executive Director of Camp Kawartha and an instructor in Environmental Education at Trent University\, he blends ecological literacy\, experiential learning\, and sustainability into innovative programs. Jacob is the co-creator of the Eco-Mentor Program and co-author of The Big Book of Nature Activities and The Wild Path Home: A Guide to Raising the Earth Stewards of Tomorrow as well as the author of the Book of Nature Connection. He co-led the development of the Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship Program\, recently recognized as an Outstanding Flagship Project by the United Nations University. \n \n  \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model.
