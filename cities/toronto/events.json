    "description": "Spirit of York Presents: Top Shelf Temptation A Valentine’s burlesque experience\n\nStep into an intimate night of indulgence with speciality cocktails, decadent bites, and, of course, some of Toronto's hottest burlesque talent. Your night will begin with a welcome cocktail (or mocktail) before you are shown to your seats in our restaurant-lounge. From there, performers will glide through the room, blurring the line between stage and spectator. We have 3 dazzling performers lined up, each bringing two sizzling acts to set the mood for Valentine’s night. Between the performances, steal a moment with your date, top up your cocktails, and savor the evening as it unfolds around you.\n\nNo bad seats. No safe distance. Just pure, intoxicating energy in every direction.\n\nOur bar team has crafted a menu of custom cocktails (& mocktails) for the night, with our happy hour offerings flowing alongside them. In the kitchen, our chef delivers a lineup of decadent shareables. Seduction in every sip. Temptation in every glance. This is Valentine’s the Spirit of York way.\n\nSource: Toronto Events (Tockify)",

After learning the history of snowshoes and practicing our stride, we’ll head out on an Olympic-themed nature walk through frosty forests on snowy trails, discovering how animals compete to survive during the coldest season.

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

    "description": "TORONTO ARTS & CULTURE\n{ SOLD-OUT }\n\n*“A searing tale of a Mother’s devotion, defiance, and survival.”*\n\nTwo decades after **Anusree Roy** wrote her hit play *Pyaasa*, she returns to **Theatre Passe Muraille** with a powerful sequel — *Through the Eyes of God*.\n\nTickets are **$40 each**. *Reserve your own* at the link below. Venue only has 40 seats!!\n\nChaya, the protagonist at the centre of the original play, is now a spirited young woman and mother, who is arrested for the desperate act of stealing rice to feed her young daughter. But soon she faces a far greater horror: her child, Krishna, has been trafficked to Delhi. Driven by primal love, she embarks on a gut-wrenching journey through the underbelly of a broken system, where every lead is a gamble and every choice is impossible. ***Through the Eyes of God*** is a piercingly emotional and sharply critical journey that asks: How far will a mother go to protect her child?\n\nA reminder on who **Anusree Roy** is:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusree_Roy\n\n**Ticket link here: (for Sunday February 15th @ 2pm)**\n\nhttps://www.passemuraille.ca/through-the-eyes-of-god/\n\nNOTE: this performance is taking place in the new smaller/intimate 'Back Space\" at Theatre Passe Muraille.\n\n*Theatre Passe Muraille* is Canada's alternative theatre company for Independent and experimental theatrical work since 1968.\n\nAlso--this Play has just been recommended as 'Not to be missed' by a local theatre reviewer!\n\n**Seating for 40 people only!** Plan ahead. Don't delay.\n\nI found this review from 2008--**PYAASA** (her original play about the outlawed caste system)\n\nhttps://www.stage-door.com/Theatre/2008/Entries/2008/10/27_Pyaasa.html\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Arts & Culture",

Snowshoes will be provided by the High Park Nature Centre. Note: This event is highly snow-dependent. The program may be modified or canceled if the forecast changes. What to Wear Unlike skis, snowshoes don’t require special boots.  Snowshoes can be adjusted to fit most winter boots.  Insulated, waterproof winter boots are ideal for snowshoeing.

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

    "description": "Try New Things in Toronto!\n**❄️ Winter Ravines Walk: Finch West to Downsview Park ❄️**\n\nIf winter has been making you want to hibernate, this is your sign to bundle up, step outside, and do something that feels genuinely good for the soul. This winter walk is all about fresh air, movement, conversation, and discovering just how much green space is quietly tucked into the city — even in the colder months.\n\nWe’ll start at **Finch West Subway Station** and head out together along the **Finch Corridor Trail**, an unexpectedly peaceful stretch that eases you into the walk. From there, we’ll move through **Derrydowns Park** and **Downsview Dells Park**, where winter turns the ravines into a calm, almost meditative landscape — snow-dusted paths, bare trees, and that crisp, quiet feeling you only get this time of year.\n\nThis isn’t a power walk and it’s not a hike that leaves you gasping for air. It’s an **easy-to-moderate winter stroll**, paced so people can chat, get to know one another, and actually enjoy where they are. These walks have a way of breaking down walls — conversations flow more easily when you’re walking side by side, and by the time we reach the end, strangers often feel like familiar faces.\nWe’ll finish our journey at **Downsview Park**, wrapping up at\n\n**Downsview Park Subway Station**, feeling refreshed, accomplished, and very glad we didn’t stay inside.\n\n📱 **Don’t forget to join our WhatsApp group** – [CLICK HERE!](https://chat.whatsapp.com/H59mSCbsAi018gYANrKAnc?mode=ac_t)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\#\\#\\# ❄️ Meetup Details ❄️\n\n⚠️ **Please Note:**\nThis is a true winter walk. Don’t sign up if you’re not comfortable walking in cold or snowy conditions.\n✔️ The walk happens in *almost* all weather\n❌ The event will be cancelled only if it’s **-20°C or colder**\n\n📍 **Meetup Location:**\nOutside **Finich West Subway Station** — look for Mathew in his iconic **Moose Hat** 🫎\n\n⏰ **Meetup Time:**\n**11:00 AM** — I will only wait **5 minutes** (this is a firm 5 minutes because… winter ❄️😉)\n💲 **Meetup Fee:**\n$5 cash in person **or** e-transfer to \\*\\*[mathewmaclean@hotmail.com**](http://mathewmaclean@hotmail.com%2A%2A/)\n\n🏁 **End Spot:** Yorkdale Mall\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\#\\#\\# 🧣 What to Bring 🧣\n\n• Water\n• Good winter boots\n• Gloves & hat\n• Something warm to drink ☕\n• A small snack\n• A friend, family member or guest\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n🚶‍♂️ **Can I Leave Early?**\nAbsolutely — leave anytime you like.

    "description": "If you're looking for a creative, after-school, winter program in downtown Toronto, check out the \"Bentway after school\".\n\nThe Bentway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with lots of fun, creativity, and outdoor discovery along the way. The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

    "description": "A Book Club, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads \"**Heart the Lover**\" by Lily King.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/6289524441481216) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n\"For its first half...a wry, witty, exquisitely evocative campus tale, a fevered fiction of a youthful love triangle, and a reflection,...on the growth and development of a writer. By the end, it stands as one of the most emotionally devastating and soulfully wise novels I have ever read ... Literary without pretension, emotional without maudlin sentimentality. It must be said, however, that King skirts perilously close to the latter in Part 3, and it is a tribute to the power of her moral vision, the precision of her prose, and her animating empathy that the novel avoids bathos and pulls off these wild swerves convincingly ... Heartrending, swoonily romantic, rigorously clear-sighted.\" (from [The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/23/arts/lily-king-heart-the-lover/))\n\n\"Our narrator understands good love stories—their secrets and subtext, their highs and their free falls. But her greatest love story, the one she lived, never followed the simple rules.\nIn the fall of her senior year of college, she meets two star students from her 17th-Century Lit class: Sam and Yash. Best friends living off-campus in the elegant house of a professor on sabbatical, the boys invite her into their intoxicating world of academic fervor, rapid-fire banter and raucous card games. They nickname her Jordan, and she quickly discovers the pleasures of friendship, love and her own intellectual ambition. Youthful passion is unpredictable though, and she soon finds herself at the center of a charged and intricate triangle. As graduation comes and goes, choices made will alter these three lives forever.\nDecades later, Jordan is living the life she dreamed of, and the vulnerable days of her youth seem comfortably behind her. But when a surprise visit and unexpected news brings the past crashing into the present, Jordan returns to a world she left behind and is forced to confront the decisions and deceptions of her younger self.\nWritten with the superb wit and emotional sensitivity fans and critics of Lily King have come to adore, *Heart the Lover* is a deeply moving story that celebrates love, friendship, and the transformative nature of forgiveness. Wise, unforgettable, and with a delightful connective thread to *Writers & Lovers*, this is King at her very best, affirming her as a masterful chronicler of the human experience and one of the finest novelists at work today.\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228110489-heart-the-lover))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in mind, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

Finishing them is the challenge.\n\nIn ***'Intentional* '--productivity expert Chris Bailey** reveals the surprising truth: **willpower isn’t enough**. The secret to accomplishing your goals lies in **being more intentional.** Bailey distills a decade of deep research on productivity to deliver a profound, practical, and counterintuitive roadmap to getting things done. Forget endless to-do lists and a never-ending workload. To reach your goals, you have to structure your daily actions around what’s most important to you—and let go of the rest.\n\nThis way, getting things done becomes second nature.\n\nIntegrating the science of desire, values, and procrastination with the wisdom of Buddhist monks, Bailey empowers us to build a life of true purpose and accomplishment. He offers practical strategies for following through on our goals, including how to:\n\n* Structure goals for maximum completion\n* Make unappealing, boring, or challenging tasks more attractive to tackle\n* Lower the chance of procrastinating on long-term goals\n* Create a framework for tracking intentions and progress\n* Know when a goal isn’t for you—and when it’s time to let it go\n\nFinishing what you start is more possible than you think!!\n\n**Ticket link here:**\n\n$30 Enjoy the Talk + Book + Tea/cookies\n$20 Enjoy the Talk + Tea/cookies\n\nhttps://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/news-events-and-ideas/public-events/events-listings/2026/february-2026/feb-18-do-chris-bailey/\n\nEither way--arrive by 5pm--and enjoy something hot to drink/snack!\n\nPlease note: the Rotman Author talks start at exactly 5:30pm--and finish at exactly 630pm.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Arts & Culture",

The Tuff Gong/Universal Music Canada-signed artist sees his songs as think pieces set to ‘punky’ rhythms. Drawing on his own audio engineering background, the versatile King Cruff fuses genres across the diaspora including hip-hop, Afrobeats, dancehall and reggae into his original ‘punky’ sound. An introspective storyteller, King Cruff explores the juxtapositions of human behavior with energizing, innovative sounds that uplift and inspire for an ear-bending amalgam of Black musical styles.\n\nSource: Union Station Toronto",

At the age of one, Luka had her first cello lesson with Christine Bootland. Luka also started playing piano at the age of three and finished the Royal Conservatory of Music ARCT piano exam with First Class Honours under the instruction of Derek Chiu.\n\nKnown for his passionate artistry and engaging stage presence, Canadian pianist (and RCM alumnus) Jon Kimura Parker is “insightful, energetic” (*The New York Times*), with “absolutely top-notch music-making, as fine as one could ever expect to hear” (Washington Post). A veteran of the international concert stage, he has performed regularly in the Berlin Philharmonie, Carnegie Hall, London’s South Bank, the Sydney Opera House, and the Beijing Concert Hall.\n\nPlease join us! This concert is preceded by a short performance by talented students of The Royal Conservatory. **Prelude Recital starts at 7:00pm**.\n\nPROGRAM:\n\nOmar Daniel: Duo for Violoncello and Piano\nJohannes Brahms: Cello Sonata No. 2 in F Major, op. 99\nGeorge Gershwin: Three Preludes\nSergei Rachmaninov: Cello Sonata in G Minor, op. 19\n\nTicket link:\n\nPromo code for 15% off----ISCULTURE15 (manually type this in)\nPromo works for all tickets (except the purple seats)\n\nhttps://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/luka-coetzee-with-jon-kimura-parker\n\nPlan to attend the 7pm pre-concert in the Hall lobby!!\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Arts & Culture",

Metamorphosis invites you to usher in a new eon in a brand new venue! The mothership will be touching down at Buddies in Bad Times, transforming the cabaret into a Gigerian trip. \nWe are proud to present a wide array of hypnotic, otherworldly sounds from a lineup of all local, all trans talent: \nHectik and Nolly will be stepping up to the Metamorphosis decks for the very first time with psychedelic musical stylings alongside Mission Control and an epic B2B from Rata and Zellers. Prepare to be abducted and taken far, far away! \nThis is a party for trans people first. Allies are welcome, so long as you’re an ALLY, and not just a tolerator.

    "description": "Ecuador’s highlands are well-situated to deliver a high-impact tropical experience! The superposition of the Andes overtop the Equator has allowed for a massive proliferation of biodiversity as different life forms are found at different altitudes, and the barrier the mountains themselves form means that some wildlife is found on one side of the mountains and not on the other. \nJust a short drive from the highland capital of Quito lay the Tandayapa Valley and Mindo Cloud Forest Reserve. These areas on the west slope of the Andes are hotspots for endemic birds and are arguably the world’s best places to observe hummingbirds! The trees are draped in mosses, bromeliads, and orchids. The spectacular lek of male Andean Cock-of-the Rocks is an ongoing phenomenon, and the nearby Maquipucuna Cloud Forest offers the chance to observe endangered Spectacled Bears feeding on fruiting trees. \nTraversing Quito southward, we visit the highland páramo grasslands at Antisana Ecological Reserve, watching for hardy Andean Condors patrolling the skies with a backdrop of snow-capped peaks. Our adventure continues as we cross to the Andes’ east slope and gradually descend, delving into the moist foothills around Wildsumaco. Rising slightly in altitude again, we come to Isidro Lodge, which is famous for bird and mammal diversity. \nIf you wish to have an even fuller Ecuador experience, consider visiting the Amazon Lowlands during an optional post-trip extension. \nRegister Here\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

Come dance, eat, and learn about a research study that explored movement with youth experiencing homelessness on Monday, February 23rd, from 12:15pm to 1:30pm.  \nThis dance workshop for social work students is a collaboration between the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and the Youth Wellness Lab, drawing from YWL’s recent study on the benefits of dance and movement for youth experiencing homelessness. (Shout out to MSW student Jake Bradshaw who initiated and co-led this arts-based intervention.)  \nWhat to expect \nAttendees will participate in a 30-minute dance workshop facilitated by the YWL research team followed by a lunch and debrief to discuss YWL’s research findings. Participants will learn how they, too, can integrate movement-based programming in their social work practice.   \nNo dance experience is necessary! No special shoes or clothing required!   \nThis session is open to all FIFSW MSW and PhD students. Registration is required.  \nClick here to register for the dance workshop \nPlease note: University of Toronto videographers and photographers will be present during the workshop to document the activity and create a video highlighting the research, which will be shared on U of T, Youth Wellness Lab, FIFSW and Jake Bradshaw’s social media accounts. This is not a requirement for participating in the workshop.    \nParticipants will be asked for their consent to be included in pictures and videos when registering.   \nTime, location, and schedule \nDate and time: February 23, 2026  \n12:15 to 1:00: Guided dance workshop\n1:00 to 1:30: Guided discussion and lunch  \nLocation: 6th Floor, FIFSW’s building  \nQuestions?

From structural challenges to personal obstacles, we have all encountered moments that tested our strength. Together, we will create a space to learn from one another, to envision possibilities beyond the limits placed on us, and to explore strategies that replenish our spirit, affirm our identity, and ignite our capacity to rise. This is a moment to reconnect with our power, celebrate our resilience, and chart pathways toward collective growth and fulfillment. \n  \nAbout the presenter\nRenata Hall is a PhD candidate, published Black feminist scholar, Woman of Distinction 2022 Awardee, President’s Award for Outstanding Individual Service Awardee, co-creator of the Learning in Colour digital platform, and former Inclusion and Anti-Racism Education Manager at McMaster University.

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

Studio members made the works on display through a series of workshops led by local ceramic artists Japneet Kaur, Zoë Pinnell, and Nurielle Stern. In the workshops, each artist shared their particular approach, which the participants adapted to their own ways of making. The series sought to strengthen technical skills, broaden conceptual strategies, and build professional networks. \nFor many Inspirations Studio members, intersecting systemic barriers and the lack of accessible art spaces in the GTA have hindered opportunities for artistic growth. This workshop series aimed to address this imbalance. Presenting the resulting artworks at the Gardiner Museum highlights the work of Inspirations Studio and its members, while offering space for new narratives to emerge. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    About Inspirations Studios \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    Inspirations Studio was founded in 1994 to provide studio access, storefront selling opportunities, arts education, and professional training opportunities to women who have experienced multiple forms of discrimination. The Studio’s core mission is to contribute to improving women’s lives through the making and selling of pottery. Through creative, therapeutic, and skill-building work, women gain self-confidence and stability while connecting to community. Studio members also gain a source of supplemental income and find a new way to engage with the world as makers. Art—and ceramics in particular—can bring change and offer healing, while giving people purpose, pride, passion, and joy. Inspirations Studio workshop and storefront space is located at 389 Church St, on the main floor of YWCA Toronto’s supportive housing building.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                     \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

    "description": "The Secret Lives of Cats \nOutdoor domestic cats are estimated to be highly impactful to wildlife. In Canada it’s been estimated that cats kill 60 million birds per year. While mortality estimates by cats are staggering there are uncertainties regarding what species are killed, how they vary across environments and why certain cats have higher predation rates. To address these questions, Jonathan attached animal-borne cameras, CatCams, and GPS trackers, to owned cats in southwestern Ontario, around Guelph-Kitchener/Waterloo-Cambridge, and the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, between Kelowna and Osoyoos. These cameras recorded from the point-of-view of each cat, allowing Jonathan to accurately calculate predation rates and identify prey species. \nAudience members will get a sneak peak of the world through the eyes of a cat and learn what species are commonly depredated by cats in Canada, how they differ between regions, and what factors determine which cats have higher predation rates. \nAbout Jonathan Chu \nJonathan is a PhD Candidate at the University of Guelph studying outdoor domestic cats. He has primarily focused on the impacts cats have on wildlife by employing the use of animal-borne cameras that he attaches to owned domestic cats. These cameras allow him to see the world from the point-of-view of a cat. By using these cameras, he can ascertain the types of species, and the number of animals cats depredate when they are outdoors. He aims to understand the role cats play in the outdoor environment and what we can do to ensure cats, humans and wildlife can sustainably live in our urban environments together. Collecting insects and watching birds in the urban parks he frequented when he was growing up inspired him to study Urban Ecology. When not spying on the secret lives of cats he finds any excuse to watch birds. \n \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model. If you are in a position to make a contribution, all proceeds help us to offer meaningful events and activities for our community to engage with and learn about our natural world. \nVenue \nDuring the colder months, the Conversations for Conservation series will be held at the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 126 (Preston), located at 334 Westminster Dr N, Cambridge.  Parking is available on site. \nThe Conversations for Conservation series is supported by the City of Cambridge. \nQuestions? Contact Amanda Humphreys, Events & Development Coordinator, at Amanda.Humphreys@raresites.org or (519) 650-9336 x122.\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n  \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

She discovered this art form when she was looking for a creative outlet from her engineering job. She was amazed by the possibilities and beauty of paper quilling, that she decided to pursue it as a full-time career. Since then, she has been passionately mastering this technique and has created many artworks drawing inspiration from nature, music and travel. She cuts the paper strips in different widths to add depth and dimension to her creations. She loves to play with the colours and experiment with the quilling techniques to create her own distinctive style. Deepa believes that anyone can learn this art form, regardless of their age or skill level and she hosts many workshops to spread the joy of quilling. She enjoys seeing her students discover their own creativity and style in paper quilling. \nWebsite: https://www.deepakrishnan.com/ \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

The cost for this event is $45 pp, please **[buy your ticket here.](https://www.breathinginnature.com/product/breath-sweat-and-chills-wild-breath-journey/)** Only 25 seats!\n\n**The Breath**\nWe begin with guided breathwork in the warm sauna as the drum beats in time with your heart, calling you deeper into your body, into the primal rhythms of the soul.\n**The Sweat**\nIn the post-breath bliss – the heat rises. The sauna becomes a womb of transformation, the sweat rising as layers fall away. Old energies melt. Boundaries dissolve. You become pure presence.\n**The Cold**\nWhen you’re ready—plunge into one of the five ice baths. Shudder, shake, and shiver away the stagnant energy that no longer serves. Feel the fire of your own vitality reignite as the cold awakens every cell.\n\nRinse and repeat as needed, moving through contrast therapy throughout the evening. Enjoy social time at Revive afterwards.\n\nCheck your emails for confirmation and the link to the waiver for Revive.\n[Buy yout ticket now.](https://www.breathinginnature.com/product/breath-sweat-and-chills-wild-breath-journey/)\n\nSource: Meetup: High Park Yoga",

You need to have a ticket in order to attend this event: https://luma.com/together-toronto-mar-2-2026\n\n**​Together Toronto brings the city’s tech community together for an evening of connection, inspiration, and learning**\n\n​Together Toronto is where the city’s most passionate tech builders, thinkers, and doers come together to learn from the journeys that rarely get shared. At this signature event, we spotlight real stories from founders who’ve navigated the ups, downs, and in-betweens of building in Toronto’s fast-moving tech scene. These aren’t polished pitches or surface-level panels, they’re honest, behind-the-scenes conversations that reveal what it actually takes to launch, scale, and grow a company.\n\n​You’ll hear from entrepreneurs who’ve taken bold bets, faced unexpected challenges, and found creative ways to move forward. Their stories offer more than inspiration - they deliver lessons, frameworks, and insights that can change how you approach your own work. Whether you're starting your first venture, scaling a team, or simply curious about how Canadian leading companies are built, this event is for you.\n\nThis event is about more than just listening, it’s about connecting. You’ll be in a room full of founders, investors, operators, and future collaborators who believe in the power of community. It’s a chance to meet the people building what's next, share ideas, and be part of something bigger than yourself.\n\nSource: Meetup: TechTO",

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

Designed by Montgomery Sisam Architects and Andrew Jones Design, in collaboration with architect Chris Cornelius of studio:indigenous, the transformation of the Gardiner’s 9,000-square-foot ground floor was guided by the principles of connectivity, access, and Indigeneity. It features new Collection Galleries, a fully equipped Makerspace, a Community Learning Centre, and the Gardiner’s first-ever gallery of Indigenous ceramics.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

Snowshoes will be provided by the High Park Nature Centre. Note: This event is highly snow-dependent. The program may be modified or canceled if the forecast changes. What to Wear Unlike skis, snowshoes don’t require special boots.  Snowshoes can be adjusted to fit most winter boots.  Insulated, waterproof winter boots are ideal for snowshoeing.

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

Award-winning author Kotaro Isaka takes readers on a tension packed journey as the bullet train hurtles toward its final destination. Who will make it off the train alive—and what awaits them at the last stop?\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56969543-bullet-train))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE MOVIE ::**\n\"In Bullet Train, Brad Pitt stars as Ladybug, an unlucky assassin determined to do his job peacefully after one too many gigs gone off the rails. Fate, however, may have other plans, as Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe -- all with connected, yet conflicting, objectives -- on the world's fastest train. From the director of Deadpool 2, David Leitch, the end of the line is only the beginning in a wild, non-stop thrill ride through modern-day Japan.\" (from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bullet_train_2022))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nInstead of just reading the book as usual, this time we're asking that you also watch the movie adaptation. During our discussion, we'll explore the strengths of both the book and the movie, evaluate the adaptation's effectiveness, and touch on any other topics that arise.\n\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book and watched the movie before attending (though finishing either is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT READ&WATCH ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next Read & Watch (date TBA). If you have a good pairing in mind, please ensure that the book is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules), and that the movie or TV-series is readily available. When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

    "description": "Promoting ethical engineering research is necessary given the potential for widespread social and technological impacts of these research outcomes. But what motivates engineers to think and act ethically, particularly in the domain of research?   \nIn this interactive talk, Dr. Justin L. Hess will address this question by sharing types of critical incidents experienced by engineering faculty who conduct biomedical engineering research. The incident types denote the formative impacts of professional culture and academic norms, engaging in ethical behaviors, observing questionable behaviors, attending to novel perspectives, formal and informal training and mentoring events, and reflecting on one’s own views and experiences. By understanding what experiences inspire engineers to think and act ethically, institutions of higher education and engineering organizations will be better positioned to support ethical growth be it in formal courses, faculty research labs, organizational training efforts, or by reshaping institutional norms. Cost: Free\nLimited alumni tickets available.   \nRegister now\nRegister by March 2, 2026. Limited alumni tickets available. \nRead more about the Fred Kan lecture series. \nFor questions or more information, please contact istep@utoronto.ca. \nAbout the speaker: Professor Justin L. Hess\nDr. Justin L. Hess is an associate professor in the School of Engineering Education, where he also co-directs the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies undergraduate programs. Dr. Hess’s research explores how engineers develop ethical and empathic dispositions. He received his PhD in Engineering Education from Purdue University in 2015, and his BS/MS in Civil Engineering from Purdue in 2011 and 2015, respectively. He served as the assistant director of the STEM Education Research Institute at Purdue University for four years (2015-2019) before returning to Purdue as a tenure-track faculty member in 2019.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering",

    "description": "Fred Kan Distinguished Lecture In Engineering Ethics 2026\nPromoting ethical engineering research is necessary given the potential for widespread social and technological impacts of engineering research outcomes. But what motivates engineers to think and act ethically, particularly in the domain of research? In this interactive talk, Dr. Justin L. Hess will address this question by sharing types of critical incidents experienced by engineering faculty who conduct biomedical engineering research. The incident types denote the formative impacts of professional culture and academic norms, engaging in ethical behaviors, observing questionable behaviors, attending to novel perspectives, formal and informal training and mentoring events, and reflecting on one’s own views and experiences. By understanding what experiences inspire engineers to think and act ethically, institutions of higher education and engineering organizations will be better positioned to support ethical growth be it in formal courses, faculty research labs, organizational training efforts, or by reshaping institutional norms.  \nAbout the Speaker: \n\nDr. Justin L. Hess is an associate professor in the School of Engineering Education, where he also co-directs the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies undergraduate programs. Dr. Hess’s research explores how engineers develop ethical and empathic dispositions. He received his PhD in Engineering Education from Purdue University in 2015, and his BS/MS in Civil Engineering from Purdue in 2011 and 2015, respectively. He served as the assistant director of the STEM Education Research Institute at Purdue University for four years (2015-2019) before returning to Purdue as a tenure-track faculty member in 2019.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering",

    "description": "The Logic and Philosophy of Science Group is pleased to welcome as guest speaker Sorin Bangu, a professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bergen in Norway. Dr. Bangu works in philosophy of science (especially philosophy of mathematics and physics), with further interests in Wittgenstein and Quine. He is involved in the activities of the Wittgenstein Archives Bergen and serves as a co-editor of its open access journal, Nordic Wittgenstein Review. \nTalk Title\nThe Odd Couple: later Wittgenstein and Quine on the Existence of Numbers \nTalk Abstract\nThe aim of this talk is to sketch and contrast later Wittgenstein’s and Quine’s views on the perennial, and central, question in metaphysics and in the philosophy of mathematics: do numbers exist? Against the background of an example involving elementary arithmetic, I’ll maintain that they are indeed an odd couple: their views are both very different, but also related. I’ll argue that one of them (easy to guess who) holds that ‘the question contains a mistake’, so can’t even be meaningfully asked, let alone answered — which is disturbing news for both the realist and the antirealist projects in the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Quine, on the other hand, contends that the answer to the question is affirmative. However, his reason to answer so is quite provocative as well, for it illustrates a pragmatic approach to metaphysical question. It relies on the contingent fact that mathematics is successfully applied — that it is, in fact, indispensable to science and everyday life. It is this perspective, the paramount role assigned to the applicability of mathematics, that he and Wittgenstein share.\nAbout the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group\nOne of six departmental Research Interest Groups, the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group hosts talks on logic, general philosophy of science, and philosophy of the particular sciences, as well as talks in allied areas such as formal epistemology, decision theory, and the metaphysics of science.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

    "description": "Join us for this beginner-friendly 2-day workshop and learn needle felting & embroidery techniques!\n\n\nDiscover the beauty and ecological importance of milkweed through fiber art at the Toronto Botanical Gardens! In this immersive two-day workshop, you’ll create a textile artwork inspired by actual milkweed herbarium specimens—plants that are essential to monarch butterflies and countless other pollinators. \nWorking with a soft palette of greens, browns, warm pinks, and purples on creamy white felt, you’ll learn two complementary textile techniques: needle felting (which allows you to “paint” with wool) and hand embroidery (which adds intricate detail and texture). No prior drawing or embroidery experience is necessary. \nMilkweed is one of nature’s most remarkable plants, playing a critical role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining fragile ecosystems. For monarch butterflies, milkweed is literally a matter of survival—it is the only plant on which they can lay their eggs, and milkweed leaves are the sole food source for their caterpillars. The plant’s leaves also provide monarchs with chemical defenses against predators, while its nectar-rich flowers fuel the adults’ incredible multi-generational migrations across thousands of miles. \nBeyond monarchs, milkweed is a keystone species that supports an entire web of life. Its flowers provide essential nectar for bees, wasps, flies, and hummingbirds, while its distinctive seed pods offer nourishment for birds. \nBy creating art inspired by milkweed, we celebrate this extraordinary plant and reflect on ecosystems and interconnection. \nDay One: Needle Felting Foundations \n\nIntroduction to milkweed ecology and examination of herbarium specimens\nObservational drawing: tracing and adapting milkweed forms to create your unique composition\nTransferring your drawing onto felt backing\nNeedle felting techniques: learning to “paint” with wool roving\nBuilding up layers of color and creating shading effects\nDeveloping leaves, stems, seed pods, and flowers using our nature-inspired color palette\n\nDay Two: Embroidery Details \n\nReview of Day One work and troubleshooting\nIntroduction to hand embroidery stitches for adding definition and detail\nStitching techniques for different elements: veining in leaves, texture in seed pods, delicate flower details\nCombining needle felting and embroidery for dimensional effects\nFinishing techniques and backing options\nCare instructions and ideas for continuing your practice at home\n\nWhat You’ll Learn \n\nHow to translate natural forms into fiber art through observational drawing and tracing\nNeedle felting fundamentals: choosing needles, controlling wool placement, creating gradients and shading\nEssential embroidery stitches for botanical details\nColor theory and blending techniques specific to wool\nHow to combine two textile techniques for rich, layered results\nStrategies for creating depth, dimension, and naturalistic effects\n\nAll materials are provided, and you’ll take home supplies to continue your creative practice. Optional items to bring: \n\nComfortable clothing (small wool fibers may cling to fabric)\nAn apron or smock if desired\nA camera or phone to photograph the herbarium specimens (optional—printed reference images will be provided)\n\nSchedule: Sunday, March 15 and 22 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. There will be a one-hour break for lunch. We recommend bringing a lunch as there are limited options nearby. \nRegistration: Public $145, Members $125 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \n \nAbout Amanda McCavour\nAmanda McCavour is a Canadian artist who works with stitch to create large-scale embroidered installations. \nHer immersive installations speak to themes of memory, environment, colour and line. She is interested in finding connections between scientific research and decorative patterns found in textiles and wallpaper. Her lace-like pieces are made by sewing into fabric that dissolves in water. When the fabric is dissolved, the thread drawings interlock together even without a base. Plants and their ecologies are similarly linked—a biological network is a bound system that sustains a community of plants. \nMcCavour holds a BFA from York University and an MFA in Fibers and Material Studies from Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. McCavour shows her work in galleries nationally and internationally and has completed residencies at Harbourfront Centre’s Textile Studio in Toronto, and the Klondike Institute of Art and Culture in Dawson City, Yukon. She has been recognized by the Ontario Crafts Council, The Canada Council for the Arts, The Handweavers and Spinners Guild of America, The Ontario Society of Artists, The Surface Design Association, and The Embroiderers Guild of America. \n \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world.

But we’ll be hoping for bright skies and the sounds of winter birdsong.\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

    "description": "Join us and learn how to grow your own urban vegetable garden in this 4-part workshop.\n\n\nIn this 4-part workshop series, Toronto Master Gardeners will guide you through a variety of topics on Urban Vegetable Gardening with presentations, hands-on demonstrations, and exercises. From the process of garden planning to vegetable selection and seeding, these workshops will provide you with the knowledge and tools to create your own successful and productive garden. Everyone is welcome at this workshop, which is geared to novice and intermediate gardeners. \nSchedule: Wednesdays, March 18, 25, April 1 and 8 from 7 to 9 p.m. (four sessions). \nRegistration: Public $100, TBG Members $85 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nProgram Schedule: \nSession 1 – From Balconies to Backyards: Planning a Successful Vegetable Garden \nWednesday, March 18: \nAre you growing vegetables for the first time or aiming to increase the productivity of an existing vegetable patch? This session will highlight key factors to consider when planning a vegetable garden in a variety of growing spaces. Participants will have the opportunity to begin designing a garden plan with the help of a Toronto Master Gardener. A pre-measure or thought about size and area of your proposed garden is recommended. Basic sketching materials will be provided. Come prepared with your dreams & ideas! \nSession 2 – What does it all mean!? Demystifying gardening terminology and deciding what to plant! \nWednesday, March 25: \nFabaceae and Solanaceae, Heirloom, Open-pollinated and Hybrid – oh my! Gardening can feel like learning a new language. In this session we’ll demystify the terminology first, then work on choosing plants that will suit your conditions and thrive. Participants will learn key tips for reading seed catalogues and packets with confidence. Building on your garden plan this session will guide you in choosing specific vegetables to grow. Participants will learn about vegetable selection, planting strategies and begin work on their own personalized planting plan. \nSession 3 – Tips for a successful crop and plentiful harvest \nWedesday, April 1: \nIn this session, we’ll take a deeper dive into some of the most commonly grown vegetables, exploring their growth habits, plant care, disease prevention, and harvesting techniques. You’ll learn practical tips and tricks for producing a successful crop, along with strategies for extending the growing season and harvesting more than one crop from the same space. Participants are encouraged to bring a cell phone, iPad, or other WiFi-enabled device to join a fun Kahoot quiz! \nSession 4 – Starting Your Veggies From Seed \nWednesday, April 8: \nWould you like to grow veggies that have been in your family for generations, maybe even start homesteading, or perhaps (like many of us) just have fun experimenting with a home garden? From seed sowing to thinning plants, learning the difference between cotyledons and true leaves, knowing when to use warming pads or grow-lights … in this seminar you’ll learn everything you didn’t know you needed to know to start growing veggies and herbs from seed! Our workshop activity will be learning how to plant seeds and transplant seedlings. \nAbout Toronto Master Gardeners (TMG) \nToronto Master Gardeners (TMG) is a volunteer not-for-profit organization that shares current, science-based horticultural information with the gardening public through various channels, including in person, in print, through the media, and online.

Her book, Hegel’s Concept of Life: Self-Consciousness, Freedom, Logic (Oxford University Press, 2020), won the 2021 Journal of the History of Philosophy Book Prize. In addition to her research in post-Kantian philosophy, Dr. Ng is interested in the ongoing influence of Hegel and Marx for critical social theory, particularly as their legacies help us understand the relation between human beings and nature, possibilities and failures of mutual recognition, and conceptions of progress and critique. \nTalk Title\nTBD \nTalk Abstract\nTBD \nAbout the Continental Philosophy Group\nOne of six departmental research interest groups, the Continental Philosophy Group works in the traditions of textual interpretation of human consciousness, phenomenology, and post-structuralist critical theory, among other related traditions of thought.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

    "description": "A multi-modal brain-computer interface for restoring lost communication \nJoin in-person in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nRestoring the ability to communicate to people with neurological injuries has long been a goal of neurotechnology research; today, this dream is on the verge of fruition with ongoing commercial cursor and click brain-computer interface (BCI) clinical trials. I will describe our lab’s development of an intracortical speech BCI, which is the next frontier in restoring communication. First, we built a 99% word accuracy “brain-to-text” speech BCI. To this core capability, we’ve added neural cursor control over the participant’s personal computer (despite recording from orofacial cortex). We’ve also augmented text decoding with a loudness layer and a gesture (emoji) layer, both of which provide added expressivity, and we prototyped a neural error decoder which can reduce user frustration. Lastly, I’ll describe our progress towards an instantaneous voice synthesis BCI aimed at functionally replacing the paralyzed vocal system. \nSpeaker bio \n\nI’m a neuroscientist and neural engineer working at the intersection of systems and computational neuroscience, neural engineering, and machine learning. I’m trying to understand how the brain controls movements, and to use this knowledge to build brain-computer interface (BCIs) that treat brain injury and disease. My immediate goals are to develop BCIs for restoring speech. Closely related, I’m developing next-generation neural interfaces for human use. \nAs an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, Davis, I co-direct the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab . Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Stanford Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory led by Jaimie Henderson and Krishna Shenoy.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering",

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

Alan’s mission is to build connections to nature through arts-based education. Since 2015, he has been partnering with non-profit environmental organizations to teach nature focused art programs and workshops. \nAlan was responsible for the successful launch of the Toronto Nature Sketch program in 2018, teaching all of the art lessons during that inaugural year. Nature Sketch is an initiative of Canadian artist Robert Bateman and the Bateman Foundation. \nIn 2019, Alan was a speaker at the annual Ravine Symposium at Toronto Botanical Garden. In his presentation, he shared stories behind ravine inspired artwork created by himself and a small brigade of volunteer artists.

Who has observed amorous salamanders, piscine stonemasons, or crooning tree crickets?  We are more aware of birds and the larger mammals, but there is a host of animals active underwater or after dark that are seldom noticed.  Others use camouflage to conceal their presence. Come to our March talk to hear Don Scallen share stories and show images about fish, caterpillars and other animals that slip under our radar. \nDon is a writer, naturalist, and former president of the Halton North Peel Naturalist Club. He is a regular contributor to an acclaimed regional magazine called In The Hills. https://www.inthehills.ca/author/don-scallen/  and has published two books: Nature Where We Live and Spotted Salamanders and their world” \n\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

    "description": "Children across the country are growing up with constant reminders that our planet is under strain: shrinking wildlife populations, climate change, pollution, and habitats in decline. It’s a heavy weight for young shoulders, and many feel overwhelmed by what psychologists now call “eco-anxiety.” For children, the future seems daunting and hopeless. \nYet hope is within reach. \nIt begins with simple, joyful experiences outdoors, supported by caring adults and rooted in the places that children call home. When young people can explore nature, feel its rhythms, and take age-appropriate action on its behalf, they discover confidence, belonging, and their own capacity to make a difference. \nIn Peterborough, Ontario, a community-rooted initiative, recently honoured by the United Nations University as an Outstanding Flagship Project, is charting a new path forward. The Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship is a practical, inspiring guide for parents, educators, conservationists, and community leaders who want to help raise the next generation of Earth stewards. \nRooted in local ecosystems and strengthened by caring adult mentors, the Pathway model shows how simple, consistent engagements with nature can grow into a lifelong ethic of stewardship. It offers a hopeful, actionable roadmap for communities seeking to protect the places they love by empowering the young people who will inherit them. \nThis talk will share the story behind the Pathway and explore how conservation groups, educators, and citizens can work together to cultivate a generation ready to care for and care about the natural world. \n \n\nAbout Jacob Rodenburg \nJacob Rodenburg is an award-winning environmental educator with more than 35 years of experience inspiring children, youth, and communities to connect with the natural world. As Executive Director of Camp Kawartha and an instructor in Environmental Education at Trent University, he blends ecological literacy, experiential learning, and sustainability into innovative programs. Jacob is the co-creator of the Eco-Mentor Program and co-author of The Big Book of Nature Activities and The Wild Path Home: A Guide to Raising the Earth Stewards of Tomorrow as well as the author of the Book of Nature Connection. He co-led the development of the Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship Program, recently recognized as an Outstanding Flagship Project by the United Nations University. \n \n  \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model. If you are in a position to make a contribution, all proceeds help us to offer meaningful events and activities for our community to engage with and learn about our natural world. \nVenue \nDuring the colder months, the Conversations for Conservation series will be held at the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 126 (Preston), located at 334 Westminster Dr N, Cambridge.  Parking is available on site. \nThe Conversations for Conservation series is supported by the City of Cambridge. \nQuestions? Contact Amanda Humphreys, Events & Development Coordinator, at Amanda.Humphreys@raresites.org or (519) 650-9336 x122. \n  \nRegister here: https://www.tickettailor.com/checkout/view-event/id/7270328/chk/c351/?modal_widget=true&widget=true\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

    "description": "Connect with nature and join us for a guided forest therapy walk!\n\n\nWelcome Spring and rekindle your relationship with nature through a guided outdoor Forest Bathing walk with certified forest therapy guide Laura Bincik. At a slow pace and in community with other participants and the environment, you will be guided by a series of invitations throughout the experience to awaken your senses and intentionally connect with nature in the present moment. \nWe will gather briefly indoors to prepare for the walk and consider the origin of Forest Bathing as well as some of the benefits of the practice. When we venture outside onsite, we will cover a loop of approx.1.5 Km on paved pathways, lawns and bare ground, at times encountering uneven terrain and inclines. We will be strolling, standing and sitting (if you wish to). Your comfort and safety are most important! As this program occurs rain or shine, please dress warmly for the weather and wear sturdy, closed-toed footwear. You may wish to bring a water bottle, a hat, mittens, sun glasses, walking poles and/or a folding stool or sitting/kneeling pad. \nAs the walk ends, we will gather and partake in a seasonal tea, snacks and taste honey harvested at Toronto Botanical Garden. \nIn the event of severe weather or environmental conditions, TBG staff will make alternative arrangements to the program. \nWashrooms are available onsite. \nThe program is suited for adults 18+. All participants must sign a liability waiver at the start of the program. \nFriday, March 27 from 1 to 3 p.m. \nRegistration: Public $35, TBG Members $30 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nAbout Laura Bincik \nLaura Bincik is a certified Forest Therapy guide with the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy.

She discovered this art form when she was looking for a creative outlet from her engineering job. She was amazed by the possibilities and beauty of paper quilling, that she decided to pursue it as a full-time career. Since then, she has been passionately mastering this technique and has created many artworks drawing inspiration from nature, music and travel. She cuts the paper strips in different widths to add depth and dimension to her creations. She loves to play with the colours and experiment with the quilling techniques to create her own distinctive style. Deepa believes that anyone can learn this art form, regardless of their age or skill level and she hosts many workshops to spread the joy of quilling.

    "description": "A Book Club, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads \"**[The Age of Innocence](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM185033&R=185033)**\" by Edith Wharton\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/5169317438291968) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n\"Winner of the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, The Age of Innocence is Edith Wharton’s masterful portrait of desire and betrayal during the sumptuous Golden Age of Old New York, a time when society people “dreaded scandal more than disease.”\nThis is Newland Archer’s world as he prepares to marry the beautiful but conventional May Welland. But when the mysterious Countess Ellen Olenska returns to New York after a disastrous marriage, Archer falls deeply in love with her. Torn between duty and passion, Archer struggles to make a decision that will either courageously define his life—or mercilessly destroy it.\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53835.The_Age_of_Innocence))\n\n\"Set in the 1870s, the novel revolves around Newland Archer, a young lawyer from New York's high society, who is engaged to the beautiful and conventional May Welland. His life takes a turn when he meets May's cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, who has returned from Europe after leaving her scandalous husband. Torn between his duty and passion, Archer struggles with the constraints of the society he is a part of. The book offers a vivid portrayal of the struggle between individual desires and societal expectations in the upper-class New York society of the late 19th century.\" (from [The Greatest Books](https://thegreatestbooks.org/books/146))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in mind, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

    "description": "The Global Philosophy Research Interest Group is delighted to welcome as guest speaker Sayeh Meisami, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Dayton. Dr. Meisami has published several books and articles in the fields of philosophy and religion. She is the author of Mulla Sadra (2013), Knowledge and Power in the Philosophies of Ḥamīd al-Dīn Kirmānī and Mullā Ṣadrā Shīrāzī (2018), and Nasir al-Din Tusi: A Philosopher for All Seasons (2019). In line with her interdisciplinary interests, her most recent articles demonstrate the significance of poetic techniques of thinking and writing in later Islamic philosophy and sufism, and her ongoing research is on the continuity of mythological and philosophical discourses in the Persianate context. \nTalk Title\nPoetic Thinking and the Divergent Philosophies of Rumi and Heidegger \nTalk Abstract\n\nThe talk is a critical analysis of Martin Heidegger’s engagement with “poetic thinking” by comparing it to that of Rumi’s. The comparison aims to investigate how a poetic thinker’s historical, cultural, and lived experiences fundamentally shape the ethical and sociopolitical outcomes of the discourses they create in their philosophies. I attempt to demonstrate that Heidegger correctly considers poetic thinking as a wholesome conflict between conceptualization and experiential finding that is essential to authentic human experience. This is exemplified by his reading of German lyrical voices, such as Hölderlin, that is conditioned by Eurocentrism and German exceptionalism.  I argue that both Heidegger and Rumi are great at poetic thinking and for this reason their starkly different lived experiences lead them to diverging directions:  Heidegger’s poetic thinking unleashes the “will to power”, and Rumi’s poetic thinking that is grounded in his experience as a multi-cultural immigrant and a lover gives rise to the “will to love.”  I will ultimately demonstrate that Rumi’s “will to love” functions as an interpretive/epistemic lens that justifies his philosophy of unity and inclusivity.   \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems, new questions and research directions, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy, and Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy in English, and classical Islamic philosophy.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

CULTURE CULTURE CULTURE\n\n## Details:\n\n***After an 5-month break, we will return to Montreal in Spring 2026!!***\n\nOur 25th Group trip (2-3 trips each year since 2016).\n\nAND, we will return to *PLURAL Contemporary Art Fair*--***-for the 8th time!***\n\nCheck your calendars. All DETAILS are below.\n\n***(Note--this trip is filling up)***\n\n**PLEASE READ** **EVERYTHING** over before signing on--everything you need to know is here. I'll try to make it work--but this trip is always in high demand.\n\n**There is a Non-Refundable fee to join us. Please Email me before signing up. All details are below. $150 per person.**\n\n[https://www.plural.art/en](https://www.plural.art/en)\n\nCan you join us for a mid-April/Spring 2026 long weekend! We have the best time in Montreal!\n\nSomething to look forward to--as Toronto winter approaches. We normally post these trips 4-6 months in advance. This trip is in just 4 months.\n\n--Each trip is unique, very organized, individual, and never to be repeated! For the culturally curious! Art/Food enthusiast. Explorers!\n\nWe can work off a group size of 15 people.\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT**: Please read all the information before signing up to this trip, as there is a **NON-refundable fee** involved upfront.\n\nCheck your schedules and calendars--and then double check them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Please do not sign up for the trip until you've emailed me. Very important.\n\nThese are very social trips--we are 'explorers'. Montreal treats us very well. We generally walk everywhere (thousands of steps!)\n\n**We will return to Plural Contemporary Art Fair for the *8th time*.**\n\n[https://www.plural.art/en](https://www.plural.art/en)\n\n**4 nights (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday--returning home on Sunday)**\n\n**Plural** celebrates the best of contemporary art in Canada. Created *by* and *for* the galleries, the fair presents and brings together the plurality of voices and works in contemporary art from across the country. It elevates art market practices through a rigorous selection of galleries presenting thoughtfully chosen artists and artworks; and through accessible programming that addresses current issues and questions in the field of art.\n\n**Plural's 19th edition** will be held from April 10-12th at the Port of Montreal’s Grand Quay. (Old Montreal). Just a fabulous space/btw. Old warehouse.\n\nIf you are familiar with Art Toronto and The Artist Project, then you have an idea about Papier Fair. **This is Quebec's most important Art Fair. 50 booths+**\n\n**Also, on the this trip**, we will visit OTHER larger Montreal galleries and explore various smaller galleries, food, public art, and architecture. We will meet artists, curators, and directors--with private tours. PLUS more.\n\n--We spend most of **ONE** day at the Fair, then the other time exploring Montreal's vibrant culture scene. After 20+ past trips, we are so fortunate to have many Montreal culture/gallery friends--they look forward to us/and we to them.\n\nOur full schedule of events is not finalized until late March 2026, but I keep you posted along the way (every month). **We meet as a group** before the trip in Toronto--mid/late March. TBD\n\nSpecial surprises always await us in Montreal!\n\n***Here is what you need to know to make a decision:***\n\n1. **I will** provide 3 1/2 days of cultural programming **on the ground**. Wednesday night, all day Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday. You return home on Sunday at your own time.\n2. **You are** responsible for your own travel, accommodation, insurance and other costs you will incur. In the past, members have travelled either by air, VIA, drive, Bus. They have stayed in hotels (points), Airbnb, Bed & Breakfast, Hostel, or with friends.\n\nBy planning ahead, you can get the best rates etc. VIA and accommodations.\n\nThere is no \"wrong\" place to stay in Montreal, but ideally you want to be about 1km/20 mins **walk** from St. Catherine St/Place des Arts.\n\n3\\. These are full trips\\, with very little \"free\\-time\"\\. We are on the go\\.\n4\\. On the Saturday night\\, we have a \"full Group\" restaurant dinner\\. About $125\\-$150 per person range\\. This is the only formal meal event I organize\\, although other meals fall into place while there\\.\n5\\. You would need to be in Montreal and ready to go by about 6pm on Wednesday April 8th\\, and you return home on your own time of choosing on Sunday April 13th\\.\n6\\. Can you attend\\, please be sure\\.\\.\\.\n\n**There is a non-refundable fee to participate in this trip, and you MUST connect with me before signing up on Meetup at:**\n\ntorontoisculture@gmail.com\n\nThe non-refundable fee is **$150 per person** payable within 2 days of signing up on Meetup.\n\n7\\. For your budgeting\\, **other** gallery/event \"entry\" costs may total $150 maximum over the weekend.\n8\\. By planning ahead\\, you can get the best rates on travel and accommodations\\. **Be proactive. By doing so, this covers your non-refundable fee. I travel by VIA, and stay at Airbnb.**\n9\\. These are NOT expensive trips\\-\\-but they are very rewarding\\!

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

    "description": "The Global Philosophy Research Interest Group is delighted to welcome as guest speaker Jack Beaulieu, a graduate from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Toronto and now a Fellow by Examination (Junior Research Fellow) in Philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford.  Dr. Beaulieu works on the history of Sanskrit philosophy, focusing on philosophers belonging to the Nyāya and Prābhākara traditions and, consequently, also maintaining interests in Dharmakīrti. Dr. Beaulieu works broadly in the fields of epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics, with his research to date focusing primarily on absence. He is currently working on issues related to introspection and iterated knowledge, especially whether the former offers a route into the latter. Dr. Beaulieu also maintains active teaching interests in philosophy of disability. \nTalk Title\nTBD \nTalk Abstract\n\nTBD \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems, new questions and research directions, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy, and Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy in English, and classical Islamic philosophy.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

Alan’s mission is to build connections to nature through arts-based education. Since 2015, he has been partnering with non-profit environmental organizations to teach nature-focused art programs and workshops. \nAlan was responsible for the successful launch of the Toronto Nature Sketch program in 2018, teaching all of the art lessons during that inaugural year. Nature Sketch is an initiative of Canadian artist Robert Bateman and the Bateman Foundation. \nIn 2019, Alan was a speaker at the annual Ravine Symposium at Toronto Botanical Garden. In his presentation, he shared stories behind ravine-inspired artwork created by himself and a small brigade of volunteer artists. Funds raised through the sale of the artwork were donated to ravine conservation initiatives at the garden. \nAlan currently teaches Field Sketching, Nature Drawing and Linocut Printmaking at Toronto Botanical Garden and the High Park Nature Centre. \nwww.alanlidrawings.com \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

    "description": "A Book Club, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads \"**Interpreter of Maladies**\" by Jhumpa Lahiri, a short story collection that won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2000.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/5165914897252352) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n\"Navigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling new world, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant, touching stories seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In \"A Temporary Matter,\" published in The New Yorker, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant.\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies))\n\n\"With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence, Jhumpa Lahiri traces the crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants, expatriates, and their children arrive, quite literally, at a cultural divide.\nA blackout forces a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tattered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural identity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakastani civil war rages on television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession.\nImbued with the sensual details of Indian culture, these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner. Like the interpreter of the title story, Lahiri translates between the strict traditions of her ancestors and a baffling new world.\" (from the [Toronto Public Library](https://tpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S234C194772))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in mind, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

    "description": "Perception solutions for enabling automated driving in winter conditions \nJoin in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nThis talk presents methods and findings from research on perception solutions for automated driving in winter conditions, carried out at the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory, Aalto University. Winter conditions pose several challenges for automated vehicle perception pipelines, which currently limit the applicability of the technology in adverse weather conditions. The talk focuses on two main research directions: denoising snowflakes from LiDAR data and road segmentation in snowy conditions. Airborne snowflakes introduce significant noise into LiDAR scans, which can hinder downstream perception tasks. To address this challenge, the talk presents deep learning approaches for point cloud denoising based on both supervised and self-supervised learning. In addition, snowy conditions drastically alter the visual appearance of the environment and the road, rendering road segmentation methods trained on traditional datasets unreliable. To overcome this, trajectory-based approaches leveraging vision foundation models are presented for learning varied road appearance without requiring manual labeling. \nSpeaker bio \nRisto Ojala (DSc, Tech) is an Assistant Professor at Aalto University, Finland, where he leads the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory within the Mechatronics research group. His research focuses on intelligent vehicles and mobile robotics, with particular emphasis on perception, sensor fusion, and applied machine learning for autonomous systems. He is also currently a Visiting Scholar at Simon Fraser University, Canada, collaborating with the Multi-Agent Robotic Systems Laboratory on research in semantic understanding for mobile robotics. His work develops perception solutions that enable robust autonomous operation in challenging environments. A central application of his research is automated driving in winter conditions, addressing problems such as scene understanding, situational awareness, and perception reliability. His work has been published in leading robotics and intelligent transportation venues and he collaborates closely with both academic and industrial partners.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers. Learn more about Room for Play here: https://www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/room-for-play/ www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/room-for-play/ https://www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/room-for-play/\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

    "description": "TORONTO ARTS & CULTURE\nWorld Premiere--\n\n*Ticket link is below*. $30-$72 (look at the seating map--and your age!)\n\nIn 2035, a decade after the Trinity Bellwoods Collapse, an investigation into the mysterious disappearance of a young girl leads to a very peculiar house that has sunk into the earth.\n\n**Could a strangely luminous painting** unlock long-buried secrets of what flowed beneath the home? Howling winds, storms, and the ever-present sound of cicadas remind us that nothing stays buried.\n\n***cicadas*** is a modern eco-thriller from the minds of Governor General’s Award and Siminovitch Prize laureate David Yee and award-winning composer Chris Thornborrow that serves as both mystery and warning.\n\nDirected by Nina Lee Aquino\n\nhttps://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/nina-lee-aquino\n\n**Ticket link here: (Sunday May 10th)**\n\nhttps://tarragontheatre.com/plays/2025-2026/cicadas/\n\n(Play around with the seating map, and ticket prices.

    "description": "Announcing TO Live’s 2026 UpFRONT Festival of Indigenous Arts, Music & Culture, taking place from August 14–16, 2025.\n\nUpFRONT is a weekend-long celebration of Indigenous talent from across Turtle Island and beyond, featuring three days of exceptional music, comedy, puppetry, free workshops, and community programming in the heart of Tkaronto. All programming is free and open to the public.\n\nIn association with the festival, TO Live will be installing a temporary outdoor stage and closing Scott Street from Front Street East to Scott Lane. This location will serve as one of two performance stages, showcasing Indigenous artists from across Canada at no cost to attendees. This will require the temporary closure of this section of Scott Street to motor vehicles. Front Street will remain open to ongoing traffic.\n\nIn addition, there will be a pedestrian Indigenous marketplace along Scott Street from Front Street to Wellington Street and throughout Berczy Park. This marketplace will feature Indigenous artisan vendors, food trucks, pop-up food tents. As part of this activation, Scott Street south of the public parking lot will also be closed to motor vehicles. Neither of the Public parking lots on Scott Street will be blocked.\n\nAlongside the marketplace, the existing platform within Berczy Park will become a second performance stage to fully animate the park and surrounding area.\n\nStreet closures will commence at 12:00 a.m. on August 14, 2025, and remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. on August 16, 2025.\n\nProgramming hours will be approximately 12:00 p.m.–10:00 p.m. on August 14, and 10:00 a.m.–10:00 p.m. on August 15 and 16.\n\nTO Live welcomes the St. Lawrence community to this free and inclusive celebration of Indigenous arts and culture. Additional information will be added as it becomes available.\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",
