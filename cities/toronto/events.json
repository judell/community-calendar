    "description": "Led by the electrifying Johnny \"Papa\" Shango — master composer, singer, guitarist, and trombonist — Voodoo Shango Experience is a full-throttle tribute to the raw power of '70s and '80s funk culture, with a cinematic and literary twist. Their references are bold, their vibe is contagious, and their one true mission is to spread pure, unfiltered groove. Heads will bob. Hips will shake. Souls will ignite.\n\nSurrounded by heavy-hitters from Quebec’s indie scene (Colectivo, Grimskunk, Funkafones), Johnny Shango cranks out a sound that channels the explosive energy of James Brown, the swagger of Lenny Kravitz, and the spirit of an endless funk party.\nCategories: Live Performances, Music, Nightlife\nPrice: 15.00\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

You can e-transfer to the following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nGet your history fix with this special double tour. It combines both U of T and historic Yorkville in one shot.\n\nOn March 15, 1827, a royal charter was issued by King George IV, for the establishment of King's College. The charter was the result of the efforts of John Strachan, the Anglican Bishop of Toronto, the College's first president.\n\nKing's College was a religious institution tied to the Church of England and the Family Compact. In 1849, the newly elected government of Canada voted to rename the College, University of Toronto and broke with the church. Strachan resigned to open Trinity College as a private seminary.\n\nUniversity College was created as a branch of University of Toronto. During the American Civil War, the threat of Union blockade prompted the creation of the University Rifle Corps, which saw action against the Fenians on the Niagara border in 1866.\n\nFounded in 1830 by Joseph Bloor, and William Botsford Jarvis, the Village of Yorkville was muddy York's northern residential suburb.\n\nWith historic establishments like The Red Lion Inn, Yorkville Town Hall or even the fierce political radical William Lyon Mackenzie, it was here that notoriety was achieved, in Yorkville itself.\n\nOmnibus horse drawn streetcar service started in 1849 to connect the old St. Lawrence Market in Toronto with Yorkville, and by 1853, the population of the village had reached 1,000 residents.\n\nBy the 1870s, Potter's Field, a cemetery stretching west of Yonge Street at Bloor Street was closed, and the remains moved to other area cemeteries. Yorkville was growing fast, and soon Toronto was ready to pull the neighbourhood into its orbit. On February 1, 1883, Yorkville's name changed officially. It was now known as St. Paul's Ward!\n\nThis walking tour is for all fitness levels and skills. Please dress for the weather. The extensive walking tour begins at the Queen's Park SUBWAY Station at the **southwest corner** of University Avenue and College Street adjacent to the Tim Horton's at the corner.\n\nThe walk ends at the Toronto Reference Library at Yonge Street and Asquith.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket price when booking your space for this tour!

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit. Visit our How To Get Here page to learn more about planning your trips to High Park. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Admission (Adults only): $30\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAges\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis event is for people 6 years old and above.   \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Wear\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnlike skis, snowshoes don’t require special boots.  Snowshoes can be adjusted to fit most winter boots.  Insulated, waterproof winter boots are ideal for snowshoeing.   This is an entirely outdoor event making dressing for the weather important.  Please come dressed in warm outer and inner layers including, winter coats, snow pants, mitts, gloves, scarves, toques, etc.   \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccessibility\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHike routes through High Park might include some uneven terrain and mild slopes.

Venue only has 40 seats!!\n\nChaya, the protagonist at the centre of the original play, is now a spirited young woman and mother, who is arrested for the desperate act of stealing rice to feed her young daughter. But soon she faces a far greater horror: her child, Krishna, has been trafficked to Delhi. Driven by primal love, she embarks on a gut-wrenching journey through the underbelly of a broken system, where every lead is a gamble and every choice is impossible. ***Through the Eyes of God*** is a piercingly emotional and sharply critical journey that asks: How far will a mother go to protect her child?\n\nA reminder on who **Anusree Roy** is:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusree_Roy\n\n**Ticket link here: (for Sunday February 15th @ 2pm)**\n\nhttps://www.passemuraille.ca/through-the-eyes-of-god/\n\nNOTE: this performance is taking place in the new smaller/intimate 'Back Space\" at Theatre Passe Muraille.\n\n*Theatre Passe Muraille* is Canada's alternative theatre company for Independent and experimental theatrical work since 1968.\n\nAlso--this Play has just been recommended as 'Not to be missed' by a local theatre reviewer!\n\n**Seating for 40 people only!** Plan ahead. Don't delay.\n\nI found this review from 2008--**PYAASA** (her original play about the outlawed caste system)\n\nhttps://www.stage-door.com/Theatre/2008/Entries/2008/10/27_Pyaasa.html\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Arts & Culture",

    "description": "The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone,\n\nWith a surprise landslide win in our survey, Rebecca Roanhorse’s *Black Sun* will be our first contemporary novel of 2026. It’s a great way to kick off our lead-up to the *Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025* collection in April. For many of us, *BASFF* was our first introduction to Roanhorse’s work, so I’m excited to dive into my first novel by this Hugo and Nebula Award winner.\n\nIt’s said to be more fantasy than we usually read for this club, but the story seems interesting and in line with some of our recent selections. It also reportedly has strong sci-fi themes, so it felt reasonable to include it in our survey.\n\nBook of the Month\n*Black Sun* \\- Rebecca Roanhorse \\(2020\\)\n\nAccording to [Grimdark Magazine](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-black-sun-by-rebecca-roanhorse/), *Black Sun* is \"Nearly impossible to put down\", and Roanhorse \"...deftly weaves a sweeping tale of vengeance, power, and loneliness in a fascinating fantasy world inspired by the pre-Columbian Americas.\" [The Library Ladies](https://thelibraryladies.com/2021/09/20/book-club-review-black-sun/) report that is has \"strong world-building, excellent mythology, and relatable characters.\" Again, seems like an interesting enough read to be a little flexible.\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting, all you will need is YOURSELF. If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book, we still would love for you to join us in the discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for events? [The Sci Fi Book Club is on Discord](https://discord.gg/B9NMnC2F). Join us and keep the conversation going.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sci Fi Book Club",

In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe.

Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

This winter walk is all about fresh air, movement, conversation, and discovering just how much green space is quietly tucked into the city — even in the colder months.\n\nWe’ll start at **Finch West Subway Station** and head out together along the **Finch Corridor Trail**, an unexpectedly peaceful stretch that eases you into the walk. From there, we’ll move through **Derrydowns Park** and **Downsview Dells Park**, where winter turns the ravines into a calm, almost meditative landscape — snow-dusted paths, bare trees, and that crisp, quiet feeling you only get this time of year.\n\nThis isn’t a power walk and it’s not a hike that leaves you gasping for air. It’s an **easy-to-moderate winter stroll**, paced so people can chat, get to know one another, and actually enjoy where they are. These walks have a way of breaking down walls — conversations flow more easily when you’re walking side by side, and by the time we reach the end, strangers often feel like familiar faces.\nWe’ll finish our journey at **Downsview Park**, wrapping up at\n\n**Downsview Park Subway Station**, feeling refreshed, accomplished, and very glad we didn’t stay inside.\n\n📱 **Don’t forget to join our WhatsApp group** – [CLICK HERE!](https://chat.whatsapp.com/H59mSCbsAi018gYANrKAnc?mode=ac_t)\n\n***\n\n### ❄️ Meetup Details ❄️\n\n⚠️ **Please Note:**\nThis is a true winter walk.

Over time, additional cemetery lands were added and in 1873, a new cemetery available to all citizens was established.

These sessions are hands-on, with exercises and education designed to build out the infrastructure of your wellness so you can optimize your life, one bug fix at a time.\n\nMaintaining a career in tech often feels like running a marathon at a sprinter’s pace. Too often we don’t take the time to properly manage and maintain our internal systems until we are faced with a significant health issue - an outage, if you will. To prevent burnout and sustain high performance, wellness shouldn’t be an afterthought. It needs to be integrated into our system infrastructure.\n\nIn The Wellness OS, we introduce the essential components required to create a sustainable system for our wellbeing. When we prioritize a well stabilized infrastructure, we are able to better manage stress, increase performance, have better relationships, and spend time well.\nAfter participating in The Wellness OS, you will:\n\n* Expand your knowledge of wellness\n* Understand exactly where you are at with regards to your wellness\n* Understand how the brain works for production changes\n* Define an optimized version of you\n* Design a plan for getting started\n* Establish failback plans\n* Be ready to optimize the internals\n* Transform the Big Picture into a motivating force\n\nPresented by a CEO of a tech company and National Health Board certified health and wellbeing coach, this series blends science backed methods with lived tech experience to provide a supportive, practical, and tailored approach to ambitious people who want to improve their wellbeing.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Postgres",

The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

    "description": "A Book Club, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads \"**Heart the Lover**\" by Lily King.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/6289524441481216) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n\"For its first half...a wry, witty, exquisitely evocative campus tale, a fevered fiction of a youthful love triangle, and a reflection,...on the growth and development of a writer. By the end, it stands as one of the most emotionally devastating and soulfully wise novels I have ever read ... Literary without pretension, emotional without maudlin sentimentality. It must be said, however, that King skirts perilously close to the latter in Part 3, and it is a tribute to the power of her moral vision, the precision of her prose, and her animating empathy that the novel avoids bathos and pulls off these wild swerves convincingly ... Heartrending, swoonily romantic, rigorously clear-sighted.\" (from [The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/23/arts/lily-king-heart-the-lover/))\n\n\"Our narrator understands good love stories—their secrets and subtext, their highs and their free falls. But her greatest love story, the one she lived, never followed the simple rules.\nIn the fall of her senior year of college, she meets two star students from her 17th-Century Lit class: Sam and Yash. Best friends living off-campus in the elegant house of a professor on sabbatical, the boys invite her into their intoxicating world of academic fervor, rapid-fire banter and raucous card games. They nickname her Jordan, and she quickly discovers the pleasures of friendship, love and her own intellectual ambition. Youthful passion is unpredictable though, and she soon finds herself at the center of a charged and intricate triangle. As graduation comes and goes, choices made will alter these three lives forever.\nDecades later, Jordan is living the life she dreamed of, and the vulnerable days of her youth seem comfortably behind her. But when a surprise visit and unexpected news brings the past crashing into the present, Jordan returns to a world she left behind and is forced to confront the decisions and deceptions of her younger self.\nWritten with the superb wit and emotional sensitivity fans and critics of Lily King have come to adore, *Heart the Lover* is a deeply moving story that celebrates love, friendship, and the transformative nature of forgiveness. Wise, unforgettable, and with a delightful connective thread to *Writers & Lovers*, this is King at her very best, affirming her as a masterful chronicler of the human experience and one of the finest novelists at work today.\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228110489-heart-the-lover))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in mind, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

We’ll explore real model failures and data gaps, and turn them into focused annotation tasks that then route through a repeatable workflow for labeling and QA. The result is an end-to-end pipeline keeping annotators, tools, and models aligned and closing the loop from annotation, curation, back to model training and evaluation.\n\n**Time and Location**\n\nFeb 18, 2026\n10 - 11 AM PST\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://link.voxel51.com/26-0218-annotation-meetup)**\n\n**What you'll learn**\n\n* **Techniques for labeling the data that matters the most** for annotation time and cost savings\n* **Structure human-in-the-loop workflows** for finding and fixing model errors, data gaps, and targeted relabeling instead of bulk labeling\n* **Combine auto-labeling and human review** in a single, feedback-driven pipeline for perception models\n* **Use label schemas and metadata as “data contracts”** to enforce consistency between annotators, models, and tools, especially for multimodal data\n* **Detect and manage schema drift** and tie schema versions to dataset and model versions for reproducibility\n* **QA and review steps** that surface label issues early and tie changes back to model behavior\n* **An annotation architecture** that can accommodate new perception tasks and feedback signals without rebuilding your entire data stack\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

In this hands-on session, Aaron Stark walks you through creating your first AI agent using Microsoft Foundry—Microsoft’s unified platform for building, deploying, and managing AI applications.\n\nYou’ll learn how to move beyond simple chat completions to agents that can reason, plan, and take action. We’ll cover the core concepts of agentic AI, explore Microsoft Foundry’s agent capabilities, and build a working agent live—from prompt engineering to tool integration to deployment.\n\nWhether you’re an AI-curious developer or already building with Azure OpenAI, this session gives you the practical skills to start building agents that can transform how your applications interact with the world.\n\n**What you’ll learn:**\n\n* What makes an AI agent different from a chatbot\n* Microsoft Foundry’s agent development capabilities\n* How to design agent workflows with reasoning and tool use\n* Connecting agents to external data and APIs\n* Best practices for testing and deploying agents in production\n\nSource: Meetup: Microsoft Reactor Toronto",

Finishing them is the challenge.\n\nIn ***'Intentional* '--productivity expert Chris Bailey** reveals the surprising truth: **willpower isn’t enough**. The secret to accomplishing your goals lies in **being more intentional.** Bailey distills a decade of deep research on productivity to deliver a profound, practical, and counterintuitive roadmap to getting things done. Forget endless to-do lists and a never-ending workload. To reach your goals, you have to structure your daily actions around what’s most important to you—and let go of the rest.\n\nThis way, getting things done becomes second nature.\n\nIntegrating the science of desire, values, and procrastination with the wisdom of Buddhist monks, Bailey empowers us to build a life of true purpose and accomplishment. He offers practical strategies for following through on our goals, including how to:\n\n* Structure goals for maximum completion\n* Make unappealing, boring, or challenging tasks more attractive to tackle\n* Lower the chance of procrastinating on long-term goals\n* Create a framework for tracking intentions and progress\n* Know when a goal isn’t for you—and when it’s time to let it go\n\nFinishing what you start is more possible than you think!!\n\n**Ticket link here:**\n\n$30 Enjoy the Talk + Book + Tea/cookies\n$20 Enjoy the Talk + Tea/cookies\n\nhttps://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/news-events-and-ideas/public-events/events-listings/2026/february-2026/feb-18-do-chris-bailey/\n\nEither way--arrive by 5pm--and enjoy something hot to drink/snack!\n\nPlease note: the Rotman Author talks start at exactly 5:30pm--and finish at exactly 630pm.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Arts & Culture",

Materials speak shaping a dialogue that extends beyond the artists where paint, surface and light respond becoming a unique voice in the conversation. From translucent layers to reactive surfaces, gestural marks to shifting reflections, the artists find common ground in the physicality of making. \n\nUnified by process-driven approaches, the works span painting, mixed media, and reactive surface treatments. The exhibition explores themes of emotional resonance, memory and material transformation. Light, reflection and surface tension play vital roles in shaping the viewer’s experience drawing attention to what lies beneath and beyond. Featured artists are Christie Baker, David Adshade and Sue Mackay.\n\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits, Artisan\nFree event\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

    "description": "Microsoft Reactor Toronto\nJoin us for VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day on Feb 19th: a global virtual event celebrating how Visual Studio Code continues to evolve as the world’s most loved editor, now redefined with AI. Join the product team for live demos showing how VS Code enables agentic development while staying true to its core values: open, extensible, and deeply community‑driven. See how developers are using agents, customizable workflows, and open integrations to build smarter.\n\n| Session | Description | Speaker(s) |\n| :------------------- |:---------------------- | :------------------- |\n| Welcome & Agent HQ Vision | Welcome to VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day! | Kyle Daigle |\n| Keynote | VS Code has evolved into the unified home for multi-agent development—where developers delegate, orchestrate, and collaborate with AI agents across local, background, and cloud environments. This keynote demo will showcase how the latest updates make working with multiple agents seamless, powerful, and secure. | Harald Kirschner |\n| How VS Code Builds with AI | The VS Code team uses agents every day to build and improve the editor. Hear firsthand how we integrate AI into our development workflow, what we've learned about working alongside agents, and how feedback from our own usage shapes the features you use today. | Pierce Boggan, Peng Lyu |\n| A Unified Agent Experience | VS Code has become the unified interface for all your coding agents. Learn how to manage local, background, and cloud agent sessions from a single view. We'll dive into cloud agents—including Claude and Codex—and show how to delegate tasks to remote infrastructure, collaborate with your team through PRs, and leverage partner agents under your GitHub Copilot subscription. | Josh Spicer |\n| Extend Agents with MCP | MCP Apps let tool calls return interactive UI components that render directly in chat—dashboards, forms, visualizations, and multi-step workflows. Discover how this first official MCP extension creates richer human-agent collaboration. We'll also cover the latest MCP updates in VS Code. | Connor Peet |\n| The Browser in your Editor | The new integrated browser lets you preview and inspect sites directly inside VS Code—complete with DevTools, authentication support, and the ability to select page elements as AI chat context. See how it streamlines your inner dev loop and enables agents to work more effectively with web applications. | Joaquin Ruales, Justin Chen, Kyle Cutler |\n| Bring your own model in VS Code | VS Code supports using your own API keys and custom model providers alongside GitHub Copilot. Learn how to configure BYOK models and how local agents can leverage models from other providers to empower developer choice. | Sandeeep Somavarapu |\n| How we ship models | Shipping the right AI model for each task requires a lot of testing and evaluation. Get an inside look at how the VS Code and Copilot teams assess model quality, decide when to roll out updates, and balance capability with reliability. | Julia Kasper |\n| Customize your agents | Turn GitHub Copilot in VS Code into a specialized AI teammate with custom agents, Agent Skills, and MCP integrations. We'll show you how to build agents for specific roles and wire them together with handoffs to create guided workflows. Walk away with practical patterns for making Copilot work the way your team works. | Courtney Webster |\n| Copilot CLI in VS Code | The Copilot CLI brings powerful AI assistance directly to your terminal. And now, VS Code connects seamlessly with the CLI—track sessions, view progress, and switch between terminal and editor without losing context. See how the two work together to give you Copilot wherever you prefer to code. | Alex Weininger |\n| Best Practices for Agentic Coding | After live coding an app all through the event, Burke and Pierce will share their tips and best practices for how you can get started with the power of multi-agent development in VS Code. | Burke Holland, Pierce Boggan |\n| Closing Message | Thank you for joining us for VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day! | Kai Maetzel |\n\n📌 This session is a part of a series, [**learn more here!**](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/series/S-1521/?wt.mc_id=meetup_26588_webpage_reactor)\n\nSource: Meetup: Microsoft Reactor Toronto",

The Tuff Gong/Universal Music Canada-signed artist sees his songs as think pieces set to ‘punky’ rhythms. Drawing on his own audio engineering background, the versatile King Cruff fuses genres across the diaspora including hip-hop, Afrobeats, dancehall and reggae into his original ‘punky’ sound. An introspective storyteller, King Cruff explores the juxtapositions of human behavior with energizing, innovative sounds that uplift and inspire for an ear-bending amalgam of Black musical styles.\n\nSource: Union Station Toronto",

You can e-transfer to the following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nIn the photo above from the Toronto Public Library archive is an old St. James receipt from the mid 1800s.\n\nPrior to 1844, the lands east of Parliament Street were known as the Garrison East for military purposes. York, and then Toronto was restricted to the land south of Queen Street or Lot Street from Parliament to Peter Street and Fort York to the west. With the population starting to rise, space was needed for a new cemetery out on the country, as space was limited at the original cemetery at St. James Church downtown on Church Street.\n\nIn July 1844 St. James opened for the burial of people professing the Anglican faith. Most of the city's population of 18,000 lived south of Lot Street or today's Queen Street, and the cemetery was regarded to be outside the city limits. The cemetery was necessary as the church burial ground itself was filling up fast. It was in use since 1797.\n\nA crematorium was added in 1948, and 95,000 interments and 114,000 cremations have taken place at St. James. An historic land in the heart of the city.\n\nIn many ways a walk through St. James is a walk through history. Like opening a book on our past!\n\nThis walking tour is for all levels and walkers. The tour begins outside the Castle Frank Subway Station, and ends at the gates of the cemetery after the tour.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person.\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket amount when booking your space for this tour!

By the late 1860s and 1870s, it blossomed into the world's largest distillery.\n\nAnd it's a historic jewel on our waterfront, a place to stroll, meet up, have a coffee or a bite to eat. Come and explore one of Toronto's most fascinating neighbourhoods. And get a bird's eye view of how Toronto developed around the time that Canada became a country in 1867.\n\nBut let's not forget the district to the north. The area near the banks of the Don River on and around River Street and Queens Street East was the core of the Beer Industry. Let's take a look at how the two industries came together and who was involved.\n\nFor a quick peek at the walk check out this link on my YouTube channel at https://youtu.be/xAp97lI_20A\n\nThis walk is for all fitness levels.\n\nThe meeting place for our walking adventure is opposite the streetcar loop on Cherry Street just south of Mill Street at the eastern edge of the district. Cross Cherry Street and meet at the entrance to Tank House Lane.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person.\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket amount when booking your space for this tour!

Six years of storytelling!\n\nToronto is a city of stories.\n\nIt's also a city constantly reinventing and learning about itself. It has been for the last 300 years. The people of Toronto are the storytellers, and throughout its history, women have been at the forefront of change.\n\nLike Elizabeth Neufeld, Hester How, Mary Pickford, or Clara Martin stories that have shaped Toronto. Stories that have shaped the lives of people in Toronto today.\n\nExplore the lives of ordinary women of Toronto who have made extraordinary impacts on our lives. From the death and destruction of war to the magic of Hollywood, these women created their own endings. But for many in our city today these names and many others are forgotten, their accomplishments dusted over and buried in the mists of time, but not for long. These courageous Torontonians created one lasting story to be told: Their story!\n\nToronto is a city of meaning and hidden stories indeed. Mary Pickford, the first great screen Hollywood star looks into the camera above. Born on University Avenue near College Street, she rewrote the Hollywood story and put Toronto on the film map.\n\nThis walk is for all fitness levels.\n\nThe meeting place for this important walking adventure is the Barbara Ann Scott Ice Trail behind College Park at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and College Street. We end our walk at the park adjacent to St. Lawrence Hall.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket amount when booking your space for this tour!

I advertise this on multiple platforms and the class usually sells out.\n\n\\*\\*If you don't use Paypal, email me at ralph@socap.ca and we'll figure it out. You can pay be etransfer or with a credit card/cash at the venue.\\*\\*\n\nImprov comedy uses several techniques to create laughter. These include, creating an atmosphere free of judgement, saying 'yes', active listening, being positive, putting your focus on others, and the importance of play and laughter.\n\nNot coincidentally, these are the same things that happen to us naturally when we are bonding with another person.\n\nIn this class, we'll explore these techniques not with the goal of being funny, but with the goal of being people that other people want to be around.\n\nThe teacher, Ralph MacLeod, is a co-founder of two independent improv clubs in Toronto - Bad Dog Theatre and Social Capital Theatre. He's been teaching improv for over 30 years. He also teaches these same techniques to several organizations including UofT, Google, Kraft, Shopify and many, many more.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you may have!\n\nFAQs and Good To Know....\n\nAfter every event, a group from this class sit down and have a drink together so be prepared to stay if you want! Of course, you don't HAVE to.\n\nYou also don't have to be single or bring a friend. The vibe of this class is much more 'making new friends' than a 'singles' mixer'.\n\nWe usually run to 8:15 so pay for extra parking!\n\nSource: Meetup: Improv For New Friends",

    "description": "Toronto Movies & Social Group - Celebrating 14 Years!\n🎬 Let’s Go to the Movies (and Actually Talk… or Not)\n\nWhether you're a film nerd, popcorn enthusiast, or just looking for a chill night out with interesting people — this one's for you.\n\nWe’re heading out to see a movie together, then grabbing food or drinks after. If the film's great (or terrible), we’ll probably talk about it forever. If it’s just okay, we’ll talk about it for 10 minutes and move on to everything else — books, dating apps, weird dreams, how Toronto keeps getting more expensive, etc.\n\nThe vibe is relaxed, friendly, and not too serious. No film degree needed. No icebreakers. No pressure to “perform.” Just come enjoy the film, connect with some thoughtful people, and see where the night goes Click here to watch trailer!\n\n🎞️ **Movie Title + Trailer:** [[Click here to watch trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxBof_p3_es)]\n\n📖 **📖 Plot Summary:** Centers on Becket Redfellow (Powell), who has been cast aside by his phenomenally wealthy family and will go to any lengths necessary to ensure his inheritance.\n\n***\n\n### 🗓️ **Event Details**\n\n📍 **Meetup Time:** 7:00 PM....I will only wait 5mins\n🎬 **Movie Start Time:** 7:10pm\n⏱️ **Runtime:** 1hour and 45mins\n📌 **Meetup Spot:**I will be standing at the top of the escalator wearing my Moose Hat.\n🎟️ **Cost:**\n\n* **$11.50** for *CineClub* members\n* **$16.00** regular admission\n👉 You are responsible for buying your own ticket.\n\n**🪑 Reserved Seating:**\nYou must buy your ticket *before* signing up.

One Great Evening.\n\nIf you value genuine connection and enjoy meeting people in a meaningful way, this evening is for you. Our Fast-Friending format makes it easy to engage with many like-minded ladies and gents — one real conversation at a time.\n\nThrough a series of quick, guided meetups, you'll have the chance to spark authentic moments with many different people — all in a relaxed, welcoming setting.\n\n**Book tickets now & save money -**\n[https://toro21stfeb.eventbrite.co.uk](https://toro21stfeb.eventbrite.co.uk)\n\n\\*You can use any debit or credit card to purchase your ticket at PayPal checkout. It will ask you for your email address but that is only to send you a receipt. You do not need a PayPal account.\n\nEVENT COST:\n\nEarly Bird - CAD$ 10 per person\nRegular Ticket - CAD$ 15 per person\nCash at meetup - If you have not purchased your ticket in advance then you can pay CAD$ 20 cash when you meet Faye at the venue.\n\n**Our venue for the evening** \\- Stout Irish Pub is spacious\\, has comfortable seating and not very noisy\\. We have a reserved area where our members can meet each other in a supportive environment\\.\n\n**Here's how your evening is planned -**\n\\- We will meet at 7\\.00 pm when you will be welcomed by your host Faye\\. She will manage the evening and also help you make connections\\.\n\nIf you are a bit shy or anxious then please come early. Faye will help you meet other members in a small group and help you settle down and get comfortable. All attendees are also welcome to bring a lady friend along with them for free. This will make it a lot less stressful for you as you will always have your friend alongside.\n\n\\- From 7\\.30 to 8\\.30 pm\\, we will start 'Fast Friending' where our host will ask you to speak to a different attendee every 3 minutes\\. You will be able to meet lots of ladies and gentlemen and not be limited to only those sitting or standing next you\\.\n\\- After 8\\.30 pm you will have time to interact with those you have met as well as others\\.\n\n\\- We are not a close knit tight group\\. Our evenings are warm and comfortable for members attending for the first time and those coming alone\\. You will not feel alone\\!\n\\- We have many groups in this city\\. Members of our other groups who RSVP are included as guests of the organisers in order to give you an indication of expected people\\.\n\\- This evening is for ladies and gents in the 21 to 40 age group\\. While some will be at the younger end of this range there will also be others at the other end of the range and lots in\\-between\\! You will naturally gel with others of your own age range and so you will always find many attendees who fit your range\\.\n\\- We are not a 'dating' group\\. We are focused on helping ladies and gents meet other like minded ladies and gents\\. You will generally find a good gender balance \\(maybe not perfect\\) at all our events\\.\n\n**Why do we have tickets?**\n\n1. Cover our costs - Our host is compensated for their time and work. We also pay meetup and have dedicated staff to manage our events, hosts, venues and communication.\n2. Group Safety - By securing your ticket we have a record and you contribute to a well organized evening where everyone is more committed and better behaved.\n3. Management - Tickets help us better manage attendee group size, book suitable space and activity.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nABOUT [fastfriends.co.uk ](https://fastfriends.co.uk/)-\n\nWe have connected members successfully for the past 10 years in over 30 cities (operating as Expatsclub, MeetConnectDevelop and fastfriends.co.uk).\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nYou can contact our founder Dan on +447715705005 with any questions or ideas.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**Here are some videos which will give you some guidance and comfort to make your attendance more productive.**\nSecrets for socialising at our meetups - [https://bit.ly/44ZdVwx](https://bit.ly/44ZdVwx)\nMaking new friends -[ https://bit.ly/455TsWY](https://bit.ly/455TsWY)\nHow to make people like you instantly - [https://bit.ly/3Vj5PeT](https://bit.ly/3Vj5PeT)\nMembers review - [https://bit.ly/3yHfu6d](https://bit.ly/3yHfu6d)\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto 20s-50s Singles Social",

    "description": "Ecuador’s highlands are well-situated to deliver a high-impact tropical experience! The superposition of the Andes overtop the Equator has allowed for a massive proliferation of biodiversity as different life forms are found at different altitudes, and the barrier the mountains themselves form means that some wildlife is found on one side of the mountains and not on the other. \nJust a short drive from the highland capital of Quito lay the Tandayapa Valley and Mindo Cloud Forest Reserve. These areas on the west slope of the Andes are hotspots for endemic birds and are arguably the world’s best places to observe hummingbirds! The trees are draped in mosses, bromeliads, and orchids. The spectacular lek of male Andean Cock-of-the Rocks is an ongoing phenomenon, and the nearby Maquipucuna Cloud Forest offers the chance to observe endangered Spectacled Bears feeding on fruiting trees. \nTraversing Quito southward, we visit the highland páramo grasslands at Antisana Ecological Reserve, watching for hardy Andean Condors patrolling the skies with a backdrop of snow-capped peaks. Our adventure continues as we cross to the Andes’ east slope and gradually descend, delving into the moist foothills around Wildsumaco. Rising slightly in altitude again, we come to Isidro Lodge, which is famous for bird and mammal diversity. \nIf you wish to have an even fuller Ecuador experience, consider visiting the Amazon Lowlands during an optional post-trip extension. \nRegister Here\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

Get it now for $125.00 for 1 year of unlimited tours, email**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n**for more information or for signing up!\\*\\***\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket amount when booking your space for this tour! You can e-transfer to the following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nFirst it was **Ambrose Small** and my team of brilliant detectives who tried to figure it all out. The walkers on this tour just about cracked the case. Well done my detectives. But your smarts are needed again however. The Harley Karulis Detective Agency needs your help! And this one needs all our brain power to figure out. This one might be the toughest assignment yet.\n\nHere is your case file. The details you will need to get started on this walking tour.\n\nA case that shocked Torontonians when it occurred in late October of 1933, and still reverberates to this day. A cold case solved, not by a long shot. No one really knows the entire story or the truth. It unfolds like an Agatha Christie novel as you will see.\n\nThe details of this case culminates in one of the most perplexing, head scratching crimes in the history of this city and very few have heard of the sad life and end of little Alfreda Dolores Mae Hillier.\n\nLittle Bunty as they called her was born in 1932, and was the apple of her parent's eyes. Her father Alfred Hillier was a World War 1 hero, and had fallen on bad times during the depression years. He just started a new job recently. Her mother Florence was a stay at home mom and loved to play and watch her little girl out the window of their small home on Boothroyd Avenue in Leslieville.\n\nOn a cool, sunny October afternoon at the height of the depression, Alfreda, an 18 month old girl disappeared after heading out for a walk alone. Sounds on the level I must say. Warning bells!\n\nWithin a few hours questions as to what happened to this little girl started to swirl around the neighbourhood. All details of this case are taken directly from the archives of the Toronto Star and the city which paint a rather confused story culminating in the arrest of two young boys, one age 4 and the other 7 who admitted their guilt. Or was coerced into that same confession?\n\nLet's toss in a few more details to cloud the story however:\n\n1) a convicted criminal in the area, information told to the Calgary Hearld the day after she was found dead.\n\n2) another man who seemed to be present when she was found and then wandered off and disappeared from the police investigation file.\n\n3) the testimony of two underaged children that had no relevance to some of the details.\n\n4) the coroner's report which contradicted just about everything the police came up with and witnesses testimony as well.\n\nThis walking tour/game takes participants back in time to 1933 and explores the many sites associated with the tragic death of Alfreda Hillier, and the personalities involved. You will be introduced to 10 historic characters and each has their own dark secrets, it will be up to you to render a **verdict**! Are you up for it detectives?\n\nOur walk begins at the **Jones Branch of the Toronto Public Library** at the southwest corner of Jones Avenue and Dundas Street East in Leslieville just a few blocks north of Queen Street East.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person. Please get your tickets early if you would like to attend.\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket price when booking your space for this tour!

Please register on our website before coming to High Park. We cannot guarantee availability of walk-in spots. If an event is at capacity, please put yourself on our waitlist.

After learning the history of snowshoes and practicing our stride, we’ll head out on an Olympic-themed nature walk through frosty forests on snowy trails, discovering how animals compete to survive during the coldest season. Snowshoes will be provided by the High Park Nature Centre. Note: This event is highly snow-dependent. The program may be modified or canceled if the forecast changes. What to Wear Unlike skis, snowshoes don’t require special boots.  Snowshoes can be adjusted to fit most winter boots.  Insulated, waterproof winter boots are ideal for snowshoeing. This is an entirely outdoor event making dressing for the weather important.  Please come dressed in warm outer and inner layers including, winter coats, snow pants, mitts, gloves, scarves, toques, etc.   Price: $30 (Children 12 and Under – $20)Ages: 6+ years, Family-friendly, Adults accompanying children must register for the eventMeeting Location: High Park Forest School, 375 Colborne Lodge Drive \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvent Cancelled\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate & Time\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDay: Saturday, February 7, 2026Time: 10AM-12 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLocation\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis event will start at the High Park Forest School building located at 375 Colborne Lodge Drive. A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

Come dance, eat, and learn about a research study that explored movement with youth experiencing homelessness on Monday, February 23rd, from 12:15pm to 1:30pm.  \nThis dance workshop for social work students is a collaboration between the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and the Youth Wellness Lab, drawing from YWL’s recent study on the benefits of dance and movement for youth experiencing homelessness. (Shout out to MSW student Jake Bradshaw who initiated and co-led this arts-based intervention.)  \nWhat to expect \nAttendees will participate in a 30-minute dance workshop facilitated by the YWL research team followed by a lunch and debrief to discuss YWL’s research findings. Participants will learn how they, too, can integrate movement-based programming in their social work practice.   \nNo dance experience is necessary! No special shoes or clothing required!   \nThis session is open to all FIFSW MSW and PhD students. Registration is required.  \nClick here to register for the dance workshop \nPlease note: University of Toronto videographers and photographers will be present during the workshop to document the activity and create a video highlighting the research, which will be shared on U of T, Youth Wellness Lab, FIFSW and Jake Bradshaw’s social media accounts. This is not a requirement for participating in the workshop.    \nParticipants will be asked for their consent to be included in pictures and videos when registering.   \nTime, location, and schedule \nDate and time: February 23, 2026  \n12:15 to 1:00: Guided dance workshop\n1:00 to 1:30: Guided discussion and lunch  \nLocation: 6th Floor, FIFSW’s building  \nQuestions?

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

Studio members made the works on display through a series of workshops led by local ceramic artists Japneet Kaur, Zoë Pinnell, and Nurielle Stern. In the workshops, each artist shared their particular approach, which the participants adapted to their own ways of making. The series sought to strengthen technical skills, broaden conceptual strategies, and build professional networks. \nFor many Inspirations Studio members, intersecting systemic barriers and the lack of accessible art spaces in the GTA have hindered opportunities for artistic growth. This workshop series aimed to address this imbalance. Presenting the resulting artworks at the Gardiner Museum highlights the work of Inspirations Studio and its members, while offering space for new narratives to emerge. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    About Inspirations Studios \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    Inspirations Studio was founded in 1994 to provide studio access, storefront selling opportunities, arts education, and professional training opportunities to women who have experienced multiple forms of discrimination. The Studio’s core mission is to contribute to improving women’s lives through the making and selling of pottery. Through creative, therapeutic, and skill-building work, women gain self-confidence and stability while connecting to community. Studio members also gain a source of supplemental income and find a new way to engage with the world as makers. Art—and ceramics in particular—can bring change and offer healing, while giving people purpose, pride, passion, and joy. Inspirations Studio workshop and storefront space is located at 389 Church St, on the main floor of YWCA Toronto’s supportive housing building.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                     \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

    "description": "The Secret Lives of Cats \nOutdoor domestic cats are estimated to be highly impactful to wildlife. In Canada it’s been estimated that cats kill 60 million birds per year. While mortality estimates by cats are staggering there are uncertainties regarding what species are killed, how they vary across environments and why certain cats have higher predation rates. To address these questions, Jonathan attached animal-borne cameras, CatCams, and GPS trackers, to owned cats in southwestern Ontario, around Guelph-Kitchener/Waterloo-Cambridge, and the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, between Kelowna and Osoyoos. These cameras recorded from the point-of-view of each cat, allowing Jonathan to accurately calculate predation rates and identify prey species. \nAudience members will get a sneak peak of the world through the eyes of a cat and learn what species are commonly depredated by cats in Canada, how they differ between regions, and what factors determine which cats have higher predation rates. \nAbout Jonathan Chu \nJonathan is a PhD Candidate at the University of Guelph studying outdoor domestic cats. He has primarily focused on the impacts cats have on wildlife by employing the use of animal-borne cameras that he attaches to owned domestic cats. These cameras allow him to see the world from the point-of-view of a cat. By using these cameras, he can ascertain the types of species, and the number of animals cats depredate when they are outdoors. He aims to understand the role cats play in the outdoor environment and what we can do to ensure cats, humans and wildlife can sustainably live in our urban environments together. Collecting insects and watching birds in the urban parks he frequented when he was growing up inspired him to study Urban Ecology. When not spying on the secret lives of cats he finds any excuse to watch birds. \n \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model. If you are in a position to make a contribution, all proceeds help us to offer meaningful events and activities for our community to engage with and learn about our natural world. \nVenue \nDuring the colder months, the Conversations for Conservation series will be held at the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 126 (Preston), located at 334 Westminster Dr N, Cambridge.  Parking is available on site. \nThe Conversations for Conservation series is supported by the City of Cambridge. \nQuestions? Contact Amanda Humphreys, Events & Development Coordinator, at Amanda.Humphreys@raresites.org or (519) 650-9336 x122.\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

    "description": "In this duo show, both painters present their perspective on Canadian landscape painting. \n\nPetra Eperjesi distils familiar rural landscapes into their simplest shapes. Using hard edges her acrylic painting are rendered in vibrant colours with a playful/wonky perspective. The colours are unconventional and her perspective is often isometric, resulting in a contemporary, surreal landscape. \n\nDavid Lidbetter‘s approach which is softer, observationally traditional, a modern interpretation of the Group of Seven.  Lidbetter’s paintings have an emotional content. The feeling of isolation, solitude and quiet pervade his works. \n\nWhile the two styles are radically different, the common denominator is still a vast unmistakable, unyielding Canadian landscape. We invite the viewer to delve into the contrasting interpretations of landscape painting presented by these two amazing artists.\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits\nFree event\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

You're dealing with more data, temporal complexity, and annotation workflows that don't scale. This hands-on workshop tackles a practical question: given a large video dataset, how do you understand what's in it without manually watching thousands of clips?\n\nIn this workshop you'll learn how to:\n\n* **Navigate and explore** video data in the FiftyOne App, filter samples, and understand dataset structure\n* **Compute embeddings** with Qwen3-VL to enable semantic search, zero-shot classification, and clustering\n* **Generate descriptions and localize events** using vision-language models like Qwen3-VL and Molmo2\n* **Visualize patterns** in your data through embedding projections and the FiftyOne App\n* **Evaluate model outputs** against Action100M's hierarchical annotations to validate what the models actually capture\n\nBy the end of the session, you'll have a reusable toolkit for understanding any video dataset at scale, whether you're curating training data, debugging model performance, or exploring a new domain.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n  \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

Get it now for $125.00 for 1 year of unlimited tours, email**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n**for more information or for signing up!\\*\\***\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the Ticket amount when booking your space for this tour! You can e-transfer to the following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nThe story of historic Little India is a true Toronto success story, a unique look at a neighbourhood and the people who call it home. But the story is not always a happy one. Like all other areas in Toronto, Little India started out as a purely English - Anglican area and was repeatedly changed as other immigrants opted to leave the security of the downtown core for outer areas.\n\nWith the opening of the Naaz theatre in 1972, the community that became Little India started to take shape, but in Toronto the forces that developed communities were different in that part of the city sandwiched between Leslieville to the south, and Greektown to the north.\n\nWith a strictly Anglo-Saxon pro-British community entrenched for over 100 years, now changing to include south Asians, the area was seen as a rather depressed area, or an area in transition, and violence was an unfortunate part of life. Racial tensions increased dramatically with the influx of south Asians.\n\nBut by the 1980s and 1990s the district had found its feet, and Little India was a popular Toronto district and tourist attraction, with visitors pouring in from around the world to partake of the richness. A true cultural enclave in Toronto! A fascinating history and a fascinating community awaits! This tour has been revised a few times to add more historic information to the walk, it has been revised once again for 2026 with new landmarks and stories attached. Should be a fascinating walk!\n\nThis walk is for all fitness levels. The meeting place for our walking adventure is on the southwest corner of Greenwood Avenue and Gerrard Street East!\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the Ticket amount when booking your space for this tour!

All the leading ladies of the Daisy ensemble battle for the role of Juliet, including faded diva Esme Massengill in a boozy interpretation of the lovesick ingénue. Beloved audience favourites Schnitzel and Mrs. Edna Rural are back in supporting roles, and adding to the fun and mayhem, The Bard himself joins The Daisy Theatre cast for a twisted retelling of this tragic romance... with strings attached. \n\nLittle Willy is intended for audience members, ages 16 and up.\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits, Live Performances, Theatre\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

While only 9km, this is a harder hike that will see us bushwhacking through dense forest, hopping over myriad streams and potentially trudging through thick snow.\n\nThe reward is incredible however - we end up tracing a raging river along an impossibly pretty shoreline and past some ferocious rapids. If you've been itching for something a bit more challenging, this is your chance.\n\nOn this hike you can expect:\n\\- Trekking along icy rivers\n\\- Sprawling frozen scenery\n\\- Raging rapids\n\\- An epic feat of engineering\n\n***A note for self-drivers: parking can be precarious here, especially with heavy snowfall. You are strongly encouraged to take WU transport to avoid issues.***\n\n***Snowshoes are included in the cost of this adventure. Please indicate at checkout if you require a pair.***\n\n**Highlights**\n**Ferocious Rapids -** Trek along this winding riverbank with tumultuous rapids forming the river's path\n**A Forgotten River -** This river is teeming with life and beauty, how could anyone forget that!\n**Little-Known Crown Land Hike -** Hike through the unknown where the trail comes and goes. We doubt you'll see anybody else out there.\n\n**Event cost: $60+HST - optional transport available.**\n**Register [here.](https://www.wildernessunion.com/adventures/historic-winter-2026)**\n\n**About Wilderness Union**\nWilderness Union is deliberate about building an outdoors community that connects you to the life-changing magic of the outdoors and helps you find your people.\n\nMembers range from 20-40 years old. The group is a mix of GTA locals and newcomers to Toronto from within Canada and abroad.\n\nAttendance numbers on Meetup don't reflect our actual event attendance - we typically have 15-20 community members at each event.

    "description": "This 5 hour workshop will teach you the critical skills required to create your own high-quality leather projects. Open to all skill levels.\n\n\nIf you’ve never tried your hand at leatherworking, or if you are looking to take your existing  skills to the next level, instructor Jacob Johnson will guide you through the many details and techniques you’ll want to know in order to get a solid foundation with your journey into this timeless craft. \n\n\n\nOver the course of 5 hours, this deep-dive will train you in all of the core skills required to create nearly any leatherworking project. By the end, you will have created your very own fully customized leather keychain using top quality materials and high-end techniques. Not only will you take home a piece to be proud of, but you will leave with the confidence and knowledge on exactly how to get started on your next project! \n\n\n\nInstructor Jacob will provide demonstrations, explain different types of leather, materials and how to use the tools of the trade. Together you will explore a variety of different techniques with one-on-one guidance and answers to any questions you may have along the way. \n \nYour class project will be created from top-grain, hand dyed, vegetable tanned leather (vegan options are available upon request). You will get to customize each part of your project by choosing your thread, hardware and leather colour, as well as learning how to use a wide range of detailing stamps in order to truly personalize your one of a kind keychain. When properly built and cared for, leather goods can last decades and will develop the beautiful patina that only high-quality leather goods can achieve. \nThere will be a fair amount of hands on hammering, cutting, sanding, polishing and a technique called saddle-stitching (where you sew using two blunted needles at once). Site3 will provide all tools and materials, but it is recommended to bring some kind of lunch/snack and hydration. There will be a half-hour break at the mid-point of the class. \n\n\n\nIf you’re curious about Site 3 Co-Laboratory please stop by for our weekly Open House every Thursday evening, more info at www.site3.ca \n \nPARTICIPANTS MUST BE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. \nIF YOU REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS, CONTACT INFO@SITE3.CA BEFORE PURCHASING YOUR TICKET. WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO HOST YOU. \nREFUNDS WILL ONLY BE GIVEN IF YOU EMAIL INFO@SITE3.CA WITH MORE THAN 72 HOURS REMAINING UNTIL THE CLASS. ALL OTHER REQUESTS WILL BE DEALT WITH AT THE ORGANISATION’S DISCRETION AND REFUNDS MAY NOT BE GIVEN.\n\nSource: Site 3 CoLaboratory",

You can e-transfer to the following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nFirst it was **Ambrose Small** and my team of brilliant detectives who tried to figure it all out. The walkers on this tour just about cracked the case. Well done my detectives. But your smarts are needed again however. The Harley Karulis Detective Agency needs your help!\n\nThe famous murder of Burt Massey on Walmer Road awaits your inspection. This time we are needed as **jurors** to figure the case out and add a fresh perspective. Are you up for this interactive game once again?\n\nThe story shocked the city back in February of 1915.\n\nHow a young teenage maid shot and killed her boss on Walmer Road in the Annex made headlines across Canada and around the world. But it was the name of that boss that made people gasp, the Massey family, from the famous music hall of the same name on Shuter Street in downtown Toronto! And people talked and tried to come up with explanations.\n\nBut the following trial exposed the undercurrents of Toronto life, and the class system that was in place. This trial changed Toronto at a crucial time in its history. The first World War was raging in Europe, and residents of the city now had something else to think about.\n\nMurder!\n\nHow this could have happened to an upper middle class family in the centre of Toronto, the Annex neighbourhood was rife with theory and fears.\n\nThis walking tour/game takes participants back in time to the 1915 trial and explores the many sites associated with the trial and the personalities involved. You will be introduced to 15 historic characters and each has their own dark secrets, it will be up to you to render a **verdict** in this case. Guilty, or Not Guilty, and was the trial fair, those are the questions that need answering! Are you up for it?\n\nSites like the National Club and the Toronto Club, Old City Hall and the Morgue are explored and their stories exposed.\n\n**This tour requires a PRESTO card for TTC as this tour uses transit to get around the city for stops outside the downtown core. One could call it a hop on hop off walking tour!**\n\nOur walk begins on the steps of Old City Hall at the northeast corner of Bay Street and Queen Street West. We end the tour at the site of the murder in the Annex for the reading of the verdict! Just like in the Ambrose Small case, we end where it all begins!\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person. Please get your tickets early if you would like to attend.\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket price when booking your space for this tour!

She discovered this art form when she was looking for a creative outlet from her engineering job. She was amazed by the possibilities and beauty of paper quilling, that she decided to pursue it as a full-time career. Since then, she has been passionately mastering this technique and has created many artworks drawing inspiration from nature, music and travel. She cuts the paper strips in different widths to add depth and dimension to her creations. She loves to play with the colours and experiment with the quilling techniques to create her own distinctive style. Deepa believes that anyone can learn this art form, regardless of their age or skill level and she hosts many workshops to spread the joy of quilling.

    "description": "Improv For New Friends\nDon't be disappointed if you don't see a bunch of people attending. I advertise this on multiple platforms and the class usually sells out.\n\n\\*\\*If you don't use Paypal, email me at ralph@socap.ca and we'll figure it out. You can pay be etransfer or with a credit card/cash at the venue.\\*\\*\n\nImprov comedy uses several techniques to create laughter. These include, creating an atmosphere free of judgement, saying 'yes', active listening, being positive, putting your focus on others, and the importance of play and laughter.\n\nNot coincidentally, these are the same things that happen to us naturally when we are bonding with another person.\n\nIn this class, we'll explore these techniques not with the goal of being funny, but with the goal of being people that other people want to be around.\n\nThe teacher, Ralph MacLeod, is a co-founder of two independent improv clubs in Toronto - Bad Dog Theatre and Social Capital Theatre. He's been teaching improv for over 30 years. He also teaches these same techniques to several organizations including UofT, Google, Kraft, Shopify and many, many more.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you may have!\n\nFAQs and Good To Know....\n\nAfter every event, a group from this class sit down and have a drink together so be prepared to stay if you want! Of course, you don't HAVE to.\n\nYou also don't have to be single or bring a friend. The vibe of this class is much more 'making new friends' than a 'singles' mixer'.\n\nWe usually run to 8:15 so pay for extra parking!\n\nSource: Meetup: Improv For New Friends",

One Great Evening.\n\nIf you value genuine connection and enjoy meeting people in a meaningful way, this evening is for you. Our Fast-Friending format makes it easy to engage with many like-minded ladies and gents — one real conversation at a time.\n\nThrough a series of quick, guided meetups, you'll have the chance to spark authentic moments with many different people — all in a relaxed, welcoming setting.\n\n**Book tickets now & save money -**\n[https://toro28thfeb.eventbrite.co.uk](https://toro28thfeb.eventbrite.co.uk)\n\n\\*You can use any debit or credit card to purchase your ticket at PayPal checkout. It will ask you for your email address but that is only to send you a receipt. You do not need a PayPal account.\n\nEVENT COST:\n\nEarly Bird - CAD$ 10 per person\nRegular Ticket - CAD$ 15 per person\nCash at meetup - If you have not purchased your ticket in advance then you can pay CAD$ 20 cash when you meet Faye at the venue.\n\n**Our venue for the evening** \\- Stout Irish Pub is spacious\\, has comfortable seating and not very noisy\\. We have a reserved area where our members can meet each other in a supportive environment\\.\n\n**Here's how your evening is planned -**\n\\- We will meet at 7\\.00 pm when you will be welcomed by your host Faye\\. She will manage the evening and also help you make connections\\.\n\nIf you are a bit shy or anxious then please come early. Faye will help you meet other members in a small group and help you settle down and get comfortable. All attendees are also welcome to bring a lady friend along with them for free. This will make it a lot less stressful for you as you will always have your friend alongside.\n\n\\- From 7\\.30 to 8\\.30 pm\\, we will start 'Fast Friending' where our host will ask you to speak to a different attendee every 3 minutes\\. You will be able to meet lots of ladies and gentlemen and not be limited to only those sitting or standing next you\\.\n\\- After 8\\.30 pm you will have time to interact with those you have met as well as others\\.\n\n\\- We are not a close knit tight group\\. Our evenings are warm and comfortable for members attending for the first time and those coming alone\\. You will not feel alone\\!\n\\- We have many groups in this city\\. Members of our other groups who RSVP are included as guests of the organisers in order to give you an indication of expected people\\.\n\\- This evening is for ladies and gents in the 21 to 40 age group\\. While some will be at the younger end of this range there will also be others at the other end of the range and lots in\\-between\\! You will naturally gel with others of your own age range and so you will always find many attendees who fit your range\\.\n\\- We are not a 'dating' group\\. We are focused on helping ladies and gents meet other like minded ladies and gents\\. You will generally find a good gender balance \\(maybe not perfect\\) at all our events\\.\n\n**Why do we have tickets?**\n\n1. Cover our costs - Our host is compensated for their time and work. We also pay meetup and have dedicated staff to manage our events, hosts, venues and communication.\n2. Group Safety - By securing your ticket we have a record and you contribute to a well organized evening where everyone is more committed and better behaved.\n3. Management - Tickets help us better manage attendee group size, book suitable space and activity.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nABOUT [fastfriends.co.uk ](https://fastfriends.co.uk/)-\n\nWe have connected members successfully for the past 10 years in over 30 cities (operating as Expatsclub, MeetConnectDevelop and fastfriends.co.uk).\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nYou can contact our founder Dan on +447715705005 with any questions or ideas.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**Here are some videos which will give you some guidance and comfort to make your attendance more productive.**\nSecrets for socialising at our meetups - [https://bit.ly/44ZdVwx](https://bit.ly/44ZdVwx)\nMaking new friends -[ https://bit.ly/455TsWY](https://bit.ly/455TsWY)\nHow to make people like you instantly - [https://bit.ly/3Vj5PeT](https://bit.ly/3Vj5PeT)\nMembers review - [https://bit.ly/3yHfu6d](https://bit.ly/3yHfu6d)\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto 20s-50s Singles Social",

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

The cost for this event is $45 pp, please **[buy your ticket here.](https://www.breathinginnature.com/product/breath-sweat-and-chills-wild-breath-journey/)** Only 25 seats!\n\n**The Breath**\nWe begin with guided breathwork in the warm sauna as the drum beats in time with your heart, calling you deeper into your body, into the primal rhythms of the soul.\n**The Sweat**\nIn the post-breath bliss – the heat rises. The sauna becomes a womb of transformation, the sweat rising as layers fall away. Old energies melt. Boundaries dissolve. You become pure presence.\n**The Cold**\nWhen you’re ready—plunge into one of the five ice baths. Shudder, shake, and shiver away the stagnant energy that no longer serves. Feel the fire of your own vitality reignite as the cold awakens every cell.\n\nRinse and repeat as needed, moving through contrast therapy throughout the evening. Enjoy social time at Revive afterwards.\n\nCheck your emails for confirmation and the link to the waiver for Revive.\n[Buy yout ticket now.](https://www.breathinginnature.com/product/breath-sweat-and-chills-wild-breath-journey/)\n\nSource: Meetup: High Park Yoga",

You need to have a ticket in order to attend this event: https://luma.com/together-toronto-mar-2-2026\n\n**​Together Toronto brings the city’s tech community together for an evening of connection, inspiration, and learning**\n\n​Together Toronto is where the city’s most passionate tech builders, thinkers, and doers come together to learn from the journeys that rarely get shared. At this signature event, we spotlight real stories from founders who’ve navigated the ups, downs, and in-betweens of building in Toronto’s fast-moving tech scene. These aren’t polished pitches or surface-level panels, they’re honest, behind-the-scenes conversations that reveal what it actually takes to launch, scale, and grow a company.\n\n​You’ll hear from entrepreneurs who’ve taken bold bets, faced unexpected challenges, and found creative ways to move forward. Their stories offer more than inspiration - they deliver lessons, frameworks, and insights that can change how you approach your own work. Whether you're starting your first venture, scaling a team, or simply curious about how Canadian leading companies are built, this event is for you.\n\nThis event is about more than just listening, it’s about connecting. You’ll be in a room full of founders, investors, operators, and future collaborators who believe in the power of community. It’s a chance to meet the people building what's next, share ideas, and be part of something bigger than yourself.\n\nSource: Meetup: TechTO",

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

    "description": "If you're looking for a creative, after-school, winter program in downtown Toronto, check out the \"Bentway after school\".\n\nThe Bentway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with lots of fun, creativity, and outdoor discovery along the way. The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin our virtual meetup to hear talks from experts on cutting-edge topics across AI, ML, and computer vision.\n\n**Date and Location**\n\nMar 5, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/ai-ml-and-computer-vision-meetup-march-5-2026)**\n\n**MOSPA: Human Motion Generation Driven by Spatial Audio**\n\nEnabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion.\n\nTo bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA can generate diverse, realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Zhiyang (Frank) Dou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiyang-frank-dou-0259111b3/) is a Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by Prof. Wojciech Matusik. I work with the Computational Design and Fabrication Group and the Computer Graphics Group.\n\n**Securing the Autonomous Future: Navigating the Intersection of Agentic AI, Connected Devices, and Cyber Resilience**\n\nWith billions of devices now in our infrastructure and emerging as autonomous agents (AI), we face a very real question: How can we create intelligent systems that are both secure and trusted? This talk will explore the intersection of agentic AI and IoT and demonstrate how the same AI systems can provide robust defense mechanisms. At its core, however, this is a challenge about trusting people with technology, ensuring their safety, and providing accountability. Therefore, creating a new way of thinking is required, one in which security is built in, and where autonomous action has oversight; and, ultimately, innovation leads to greater human well-being.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Samaresh Kumar Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samaresh-singh-9772ba23/) is an engineering principal at HP Inc. with more than 21 years of experience in designing and implementing large-scale distributed systems, cloud native platform systems, and edge AI / ML systems. His expertise includes agentic AI systems, GenAI / LLMs, Edge AI, federated and privacy preserving learning, and secure hybrid cloud / edge computing.\n\n**Plugins as Products: Bringing Visual AI Research into Real-World Workflows with FiftyOne**\n\nVisual AI research often introduces new datasets, models, and analysis methods, but integrating these advances into everyday workflows can be challenging. FiftyOne is a data-centric platform designed to help teams explore, evaluate, and improve visual AI, and its plugin ecosystem is how the platform scales beyond the core. In this talk, we explore the FiftyOne plugin ecosystem from both perspectives: how users apply plugins to accelerate data-centric workflows, and how researchers and engineers can package their work as plugins to make it easier to share, reproduce, and build upon. Through practical examples, we show how plugins turn research artifacts into reusable components that integrate naturally into real-world visual AI workflows.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Adonai Vera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adonai-vera/) \\- Machine Learning Engineer & DevRel at Voxel51\\. With over 7 years of experience building computer vision and machine learning models using TensorFlow\\, Docker\\, and OpenCV\\.\n\n**Transforming Business with Agentic AI**\n\nAgentic AI is reshaping business operations by employing autonomous systems that learn, adapt, and optimize processes independently of human input. This session examines the essential differences between traditional AI agents and Agentic AI, emphasizing their significance for project professionals overseeing digital transformation initiatives. Real-world examples from eCommerce, insurance, and healthcare illustrate how autonomous AI achieves measurable outcomes across industries. The session addresses practical orchestration patterns in which specialized AI agents collaborate to resolve complex business challenges and enhance operational efficiency. Attendees will receive a practical framework for identifying high-impact use cases, developing infrastructure, establishing governance, and scaling Agentic AI within their organizations.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Joyjit Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royjoyjit/) is a senior technology and program management leader with over 21 years of experience delivering enterprise digital transformation, cloud modernization, and applied AI programs across insurance, financial services, and global eCommerce.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

This once-in-a-generation renovation reimagined the Gardiner’ss role as an inspiring and accessible community-driven hub where clay serves as a bridge between cultures, histories, and people. Designed by Montgomery Sisam Architects and Andrew Jones Design, in collaboration with architect Chris Cornelius of studio:indigenous, the transformation of the Gardiner’s 9,000-square-foot ground floor was guided by the principles of connectivity, access, and Indigeneity. It features new Collection Galleries, a fully equipped Makerspace, a Community Learning Centre, and the Gardiner’s first-ever gallery of Indigenous ceramics.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum",

Enjoy their program of Joseph Haydn: String Quartet  in D Major, Op. 20, No. 4, Henriëtte Bosmans: String Quartet (1927) and Franz Schubert: String Quartet in D minor, D. 810 \"Death and the Maiden\".\n\n\nCategories: Cultural, Live Performances, Music\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

You can e-transfer to the following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nElizabeth Simcoe named the area now known as Mimico for the thousands of pigeons that blackened the sky at the western end of the settlement. Mimico was originally located at the confluence of Mimico Creek and Dundas Street.\n\nWilliam Gamble, opened a sawmill and built a settlement for the workers nearby. Etobicoke's first church, Christ Church was opened on Church Street which became Royal York Road. Mimico is a walkable neighbourhood and a great place to stroll and discover our amazing history.\n\nThe Lakeshore Hospital was built in 1888 as the Mimico Asylum, its doors opened on January 21, 1889.\n\nThe original idea for the hospital was a series of cottages designed by Doctor Joseph Workman who wanted a resort type feel to the hospital. The architect was Kivas Tully, who worked with gardener Samuel Matheson. Most of the buildings were built by the patients themselves, and helped with laundry duties, and tended to the vast gardens.\n\nBut a different story emerged that most Canadians had no idea about. And that was the story of Camp M - Mimico.\n\nIn 1887, the Victoria Industrial School for Boys opened on old Horner Avenue in Mimico, just blocks from the site of the new Mimico Hospital for the Insane (Humber College.) The school, which was a juvenile reformatory, hoped to break the bad boys through moral and academic education and old fashioned hard work. I hope there was a positive outcome.\n\nIn 1927, the school changed its name to the Mimico Reform School. But it was the war years 1939-1945 that really surprised me as a Torontonian. It was known as Camp M or Internment Camp 22, the largest camp for POWs in the centre of a large Canadian city.\n\nMost camps were constructed in rural areas, and the camp provided space for more than 520 German nationals. The history of this camp is fascinating and had links to the Toronto Central Prison on Strachan Avenue and the Mimico Hospital directly to the south on lakeshore where we begin this tour.\n\nThis walking tour is for all levels and walkers. The tour begins at the New Toronto Public Library Branch at 110 Eleventh Street just south of Lakeshore. We end this tour at Kipling and Horner Avenue, just a few blocks to the north of the old hospital!\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket amount when booking your space for this tour!

During the calm of winter, it is especially tranquil.***\n\nWe’ll start the day exploring Hardy Lake on a 10.5 km loop trail. This hike introduces you to Muskoka’s distinct scenery, around gorgeous lakes, the iconic granite outcrops of the Canadian Shield and an environment unmistakably shaped by beaver activity. Along the way, you may just spot some of the beavers, otters and turtles who call Hardy Lake home, offering a true snapshot of Muskoka's wilderness.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\\- Snow\\-dusted\\, lakeside trails\n\\- Distinct Muskoka scenery\n\\- The iconic Lake Hardy wooden boardwalk\n\\- Rich biodiversity\n\n**Depending on snow levels we may be required to use snowshoes or ice spikes. We have a limited quantity available that you can grab at check-out. Ice spikes are free to borrow and snow shoes can be rented for a small fee.**\n\n**Highlights**\n**Iconic Scenery -** You'll take in some of the region's most beautiful views and get up close with the Canadian Shield.\n**Wildlife Spotting -** If you're lucky, you may spot the beavers and otters that call this region home.\n**Pristine Frozen Lakes -** Take in the natural frozen beauty of Hardy Lake.\n\n**Event cost: $60+HST - optional transport available.**\n**Register [here.](https://www.wildernessunion.com/adventures/hardy-winter-2026)**\n\n**About Wilderness Union**\nWilderness Union is deliberate about building an outdoors community that connects you to the life-changing magic of the outdoors and helps you find your people.\n\nMembers range from 20-40 years old. The group is a mix of GTA locals and newcomers to Toronto from within Canada and abroad.\n\nAttendance numbers on Meetup don't reflect our actual event attendance - we typically have 15-20 community members at each event. Large enough that there's someone new to meet but small enough that it's not overwhelming!\n\n***Learn more at our website [www.wildernessunion.com](https://www.wildernessunion.com/)***\n\nSource: Meetup: Wilderness Union",

His professional career began with the Carla Bley Band and continued as a solo performer with a wide spectrum of artists including Dizzy Gillespie, Lester Bowie, Wynton Marsalis, and Harry Belafonte. \n\nHis powerful piece “Three Revolutions” from the album \"Familia: Tribute to Bebo & Chico\" won the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. Most recently, in February of 2023, Arturo was awarded his eighth Grammy for the album \"Fandango at the Wall in New York\".\n\nAfter the concert, enjoy a beverage and more music.\n\nCategories: Arts/Exhibits, Live Performances, Music\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

After learning the history of snowshoes and practicing our stride, we’ll head out on an Olympic-themed nature walk through frosty forests on snowy trails, discovering how animals compete to survive during the coldest season. Snowshoes will be provided by the High Park Nature Centre. Note: This event is highly snow-dependent. The program may be modified or canceled if the forecast changes. What to Wear Unlike skis, snowshoes don’t require special boots.  Snowshoes can be adjusted to fit most winter boots.  Insulated, waterproof winter boots are ideal for snowshoeing. This is an entirely outdoor event making dressing for the weather important.  Please come dressed in warm outer and inner layers including, winter coats, snow pants, mitts, gloves, scarves, toques, etc.   Price: $30 (Children 12 and Under – $20)Ages: 6+ years, Family-friendly, Adults accompanying children must register for the eventMeeting Location: High Park Forest School, 375 Colborne Lodge Drive \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvent Cancelled\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate & Time\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDay: Saturday, February 7, 2026Time: 10AM-12 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLocation\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis event will start at the High Park Forest School building located at 375 Colborne Lodge Drive. A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

The program empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban design, city building, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigations, storytelling, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session options, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  * The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic, figure-8 skate trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is held across The Bentway sites, including indoor and outdoor activities and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the elements and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut-sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff, please do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts, nuts and all other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent following online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session, young urbanists will ask questions, gather information, compare and collaborate, draw conclusions, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\nInteractive experiences including site tours, outdoor recreation, and hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth education leaders Maximum City, will encourage participants to not only explore The Bentway, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s history, current state, and potential future through skill building in multidisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping, ecology, storytelling, adaptation, and youth agency, the program empowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can become when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently and collaboratively, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Passport,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines, and ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information, contact rcastonguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway.ca\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

Award-winning author Kotaro Isaka takes readers on a tension packed journey as the bullet train hurtles toward its final destination. Who will make it off the train alive—and what awaits them at the last stop?\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56969543-bullet-train))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE MOVIE ::**\n\"In Bullet Train, Brad Pitt stars as Ladybug, an unlucky assassin determined to do his job peacefully after one too many gigs gone off the rails. Fate, however, may have other plans, as Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe -- all with connected, yet conflicting, objectives -- on the world's fastest train. From the director of Deadpool 2, David Leitch, the end of the line is only the beginning in a wild, non-stop thrill ride through modern-day Japan.\" (from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bullet_train_2022))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nInstead of just reading the book as usual, this time we're asking that you also watch the movie adaptation. During our discussion, we'll explore the strengths of both the book and the movie, evaluate the adaptation's effectiveness, and touch on any other topics that arise.\n\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book and watched the movie before attending (though finishing either is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT READ&WATCH ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next Read & Watch (date TBA). If you have a good pairing in mind, please ensure that the book is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules), and that the movie or TV-series is readily available. When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

    "description": "Bad Indians Book Club, by Anishinaabe and Ukrainian writer Patty Krawec, is a bold exploration of Indigenous literature and the stories that challenge colonial narratives. Emerging from a year-long reading journey, Krawec blends memoir, cultural critique, and storytelling to examine works by marginalized voices and their power to reshape identity and belonging. Interwoven with the figure of Deer Woman, this book invites readers to the edges of worlds waiting to be born. Praised with a Booklist starred review, it offers a potent call to rethink the stories we inherit.\n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni. Each in-person event features readings, discussions, Q&A, book signings and ASL interpretation, while virtual sessions include live subtitles and audio access.\nCategories: Literary\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin us for a one hour hands-on workshop where we will explore emerging challenges in developing and validating world foundation models and video-generation AI systems for robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\n**Time and Location**\n\nMar 11, 2026\n10-11am PST\nOnline, **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/debugging-the-future-strategies-for-validating-world-models-and-action-conditioned-video-march)**\n\nIndustries from robotics to autonomous vehicles are converging on world foundation models (WFMs) and action-conditioned video generation, where the challenge is predicting physics, causality, and intent. But this shift has created a massive new bottleneck: validation.\n\nHow do you debug a model that imagines the future? How do you curate petabyte-scale video datasets to capture the \"long tail\" of rare events without drowning in storage costs? And how do you ensure temporal consistency when your training data lives in scattered data lakes?\n\nIn this session, we explore technical workflows for the next generation of Visual AI. We will dissect the \"Video Data Monster,\" demonstrating how to build feedback loops that bridge the gap between generative imagination and physical reality. Learn how leading teams are using federated data strategies and collaborative evaluation to turn video from a storage burden into a structured, queryable asset for embodied intelligence.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Nick Lotz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholaslotz/) is chemical process engineer-turned-developer who is currently a Technical Marketing Engineer at Voxel51. He is particularly interested in bringing observability and security to all layers of the AI stack.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

    "description": "Promoting ethical engineering research is necessary given the potential for widespread social and technological impacts of these research outcomes. But what motivates engineers to think and act ethically, particularly in the domain of research?   \nIn this interactive talk, Dr. Justin L. Hess will address this question by sharing types of critical incidents experienced by engineering faculty who conduct biomedical engineering research. The incident types denote the formative impacts of professional culture and academic norms, engaging in ethical behaviors, observing questionable behaviors, attending to novel perspectives, formal and informal training and mentoring events, and reflecting on one’s own views and experiences. By understanding what experiences inspire engineers to think and act ethically, institutions of higher education and engineering organizations will be better positioned to support ethical growth be it in formal courses, faculty research labs, organizational training efforts, or by reshaping institutional norms. Cost: Free\nLimited alumni tickets available.   \nRegister now\nRegister by March 2, 2026.

Hess is an associate professor in the School of Engineering Education, where he also co-directs the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies undergraduate programs.

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin us for a special edition of the AI, ML and Computer Vision Meetup where we will focus on Agents, MCP and Skills!\n\n**Date, Time, Location**\n\nMar 12, 2026\n9 - 11 AM PST\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/mcp-and-skills-meetup-march-12-2026)**\n\n**Agents Building Agents on the Hugging Face Hub**\n\nDiscover how coding agents can run or support your fine-tuning experiments. From quick dataset validation and preprocessing, to optimal GPU hardware selection, to automated job submission based on metric tracking, to evaluation. Ben will demonstrate how Hugging Face skills can be used to define best practices for agents to support machine learning experiments. Bring Claude, Codex, or Mistral Vibes, and we’ll show you to get it training models with GRPO, SFT, and DPO.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Ben Burtenshaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-burtenshaw/) is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face, focusing on building agents with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. He led educational projects like the Agents Course, the MCP Course, and the LLM course, which bridge the gap between complex Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques and practical application. Ben focuses on democratizing access to efficient AI, empowering the community to align, evaluate, and deploy transparent agentic systems.\n\n**Claude Code Templates**\n\nThis talk explores how to configure and align Claude Code agents using templates and custom components. I'll demonstrate practical configuration patterns that ensure your CLI agent executes exactly what you intend, covering Skills setup, hooks implementation, and template customization. Drawing from real-world examples building Claude Code Templates, attendees will learn how to structure their agent configurations for consistent, reliable behavior and create reusable components that maintain alignment across different use cases.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Daniel Avila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-avila-arias/) is an AI Engineer at Hedgineer building agentic systems and creator of Claude Code Templates.\n\n**Move Faster in Computer Vision by Teaching Agents to See Your Data**\n\nComputer vision teams spend too much time writing scripts just to find bad labels, blurry images, and edge cases. In this talk, I’ll show how to move that work to agents by using FiftyOne as a visual operating system. With Skills and MCP, agents can see inside your datasets, explore them visually, and handle common data cleanup tasks, so you can spend less time on data and more time shipping models.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Adonai Vera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adonai-vera/) \\- Machine Learning Engineer & DevRel at Voxel51\\. With over 7 years of experience building computer vision and machine learning models using TensorFlow\\, Docker\\, and OpenCV\\. I started as a software developer\\, moved into AI\\, led teams\\, and served as CTO\\. Today\\, I connect code and community to build open\\, production\\-ready AI\\, making technology simple\\, accessible\\, and reliable\\.\n\n**Skills As Documentation**\n\nSkills are self-contained recipes - each one a piece of a larger puzzle. Instead of trying to modify human-centric documentation to better fit agents, skills let us build capabilities into our agents directly. This talk will showcase how to think about leveraging skills to enhance how users interact with your software!\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Chris Alexiuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csalexiuk/) is a deep learning developer advocate at NVIDIA, working on creating technical assets that help developers use the incredible suite of AI tools available at NVIDIA. Chris comes from a machine learning and data science background, and he is obsessed with everything and anything about large language models.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

    "description": "The Logic and Philosophy of Science Group is pleased to welcome as guest speaker Sorin Bangu, a professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bergen in Norway. Dr. Bangu works in philosophy of science (especially philosophy of mathematics and physics), with further interests in Wittgenstein and Quine. He is involved in the activities of the Wittgenstein Archives Bergen and serves as a co-editor of its open access journal, Nordic Wittgenstein Review. \nTalk Title\nThe Odd Couple: later Wittgenstein and Quine on the Existence of Numbers \nTalk Abstract\nThe aim of this talk is to sketch and contrast later Wittgenstein’s and Quine’s views on the perennial, and central, question in metaphysics and in the philosophy of mathematics: do numbers exist? Against the background of an example involving elementary arithmetic, I’ll maintain that they are indeed an odd couple: their views are both very different, but also related. I’ll argue that one of them (easy to guess who) holds that ‘the question contains a mistake’, so can’t even be meaningfully asked, let alone answered — which is disturbing news for both the realist and the antirealist projects in the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Quine, on the other hand, contends that the answer to the question is affirmative. However, his reason to answer so is quite provocative as well, for it illustrates a pragmatic approach to metaphysical question. It relies on the contingent fact that mathematics is successfully applied — that it is, in fact, indispensable to science and everyday life. It is this perspective, the paramount role assigned to the applicability of mathematics, that he and Wittgenstein share.\nAbout the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group\nOne of six departmental Research Interest Groups, the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group hosts talks on logic, general philosophy of science, and philosophy of the particular sciences, as well as talks in allied areas such as formal epistemology, decision theory, and the metaphysics of science.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

Tuckett balances the moral aspects of the original story with heartwarming characters, magical stage effects and playful Canadiana, making Pinocchio a delightful experience for audiences of all ages.\n\nCategories: Dance, Live Performances\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

A number of changes were made to the travel network within High Park as part of the High Park Movement Strategy that might influence your decision to drive to High Park. In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend, you will need to park outside the park and walk in, or take transit.

    "description": "Join us for this beginner-friendly 2-day workshop and learn needle felting & embroidery techniques!\n\n\nDiscover the beauty and ecological importance of milkweed through fiber art at the Toronto Botanical Gardens! In this immersive two-day workshop, you’ll create a textile artwork inspired by actual milkweed herbarium specimens—plants that are essential to monarch butterflies and countless other pollinators. \nWorking with a soft palette of greens, browns, warm pinks, and purples on creamy white felt, you’ll learn two complementary textile techniques: needle felting (which allows you to “paint” with wool) and hand embroidery (which adds intricate detail and texture). No prior drawing or embroidery experience is necessary. \nMilkweed is one of nature’s most remarkable plants, playing a critical role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining fragile ecosystems. For monarch butterflies, milkweed is literally a matter of survival—it is the only plant on which they can lay their eggs, and milkweed leaves are the sole food source for their caterpillars. The plant’s leaves also provide monarchs with chemical defenses against predators, while its nectar-rich flowers fuel the adults’ incredible multi-generational migrations across thousands of miles. \nBeyond monarchs, milkweed is a keystone species that supports an entire web of life. Its flowers provide essential nectar for bees, wasps, flies, and hummingbirds, while its distinctive seed pods offer nourishment for birds. \nBy creating art inspired by milkweed, we celebrate this extraordinary plant and reflect on ecosystems and interconnection. \nDay One: Needle Felting Foundations \n\nIntroduction to milkweed ecology and examination of herbarium specimens\nObservational drawing: tracing and adapting milkweed forms to create your unique composition\nTransferring your drawing onto felt backing\nNeedle felting techniques: learning to “paint” with wool roving\nBuilding up layers of color and creating shading effects\nDeveloping leaves, stems, seed pods, and flowers using our nature-inspired color palette\n\nDay Two: Embroidery Details \n\nReview of Day One work and troubleshooting\nIntroduction to hand embroidery stitches for adding definition and detail\nStitching techniques for different elements: veining in leaves, texture in seed pods, delicate flower details\nCombining needle felting and embroidery for dimensional effects\nFinishing techniques and backing options\nCare instructions and ideas for continuing your practice at home\n\nWhat You’ll Learn \n\nHow to translate natural forms into fiber art through observational drawing and tracing\nNeedle felting fundamentals: choosing needles, controlling wool placement, creating gradients and shading\nEssential embroidery stitches for botanical details\nColor theory and blending techniques specific to wool\nHow to combine two textile techniques for rich, layered results\nStrategies for creating depth, dimension, and naturalistic effects\n\nAll materials are provided, and you’ll take home supplies to continue your creative practice. Optional items to bring: \n\nComfortable clothing (small wool fibers may cling to fabric)\nAn apron or smock if desired\nA camera or phone to photograph the herbarium specimens (optional—printed reference images will be provided)\n\nSchedule: Sunday, March 15 and 22 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. There will be a one-hour break for lunch. We recommend bringing a lunch as there are limited options nearby. \nRegistration: Public $145, Members $125 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \n \nAbout Amanda McCavour\nAmanda McCavour is a Canadian artist who works with stitch to create large-scale embroidered installations. \nHer immersive installations speak to themes of memory, environment, colour and line. She is interested in finding connections between scientific research and decorative patterns found in textiles and wallpaper. Her lace-like pieces are made by sewing into fabric that dissolves in water. When the fabric is dissolved, the thread drawings interlock together even without a base. Plants and their ecologies are similarly linked—a biological network is a bound system that sustains a community of plants. \nMcCavour holds a BFA from York University and an MFA in Fibers and Material Studies from Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. McCavour shows her work in galleries nationally and internationally and has completed residencies at Harbourfront Centre’s Textile Studio in Toronto, and the Klondike Institute of Art and Culture in Dawson City, Yukon. She has been recognized by the Ontario Crafts Council, The Canada Council for the Arts, The Handweavers and Spinners Guild of America, The Ontario Society of Artists, The Surface Design Association, and The Embroiderers Guild of America. \n \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

    "description": "The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone,\n\nWidely regarded among science fiction readers and critics as one of the standout space opera novels of its era, *A Fire Upon the Deep* has been on my radar for a while but hasn't made it to our survey. I was glad to see it immediately selected by membership. It's especially touted in hard sci-fi circles, so it will be a good follow-up after a more fantasy-leaning novel in *Black Sun*.\n\nBook of the Month\n*A Fire Upon the Deep -* Vernor Vinge (1992)\n\nMuch of *A Fire Upon the Deep*'s reputation comes from its innovative worldbuilding and unique alien culture. Vinge is generally praised for his writing chops and being able to balance the concept and the details. As reported in this interesting [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2022/11/geeks-guide-fire-upon-the-deep/), the novel \"...juggles dozens of characters and plotlines without ever becoming confusing. Science fiction author Abby Goldsmith [says] '...plotwise it’s stunning...the work shows. The amount of time and effort he put into thinking it through, I really admire that.'\" All this said, I've heard that it can be a slow start for some readers and a hill to climb at the beginning. But once it gets going, it's hard to put down. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this one!\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting, all you will need is YOURSELF. If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book, we still would love for you to join us in the discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for events? [The Sci Fi Book Club is on Discord](https://discord.gg/B9NMnC2F). Join us and keep the conversation going.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sci Fi Book Club",

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

The form is remarkably flexible, so while the genre remains consistent, the emotional depth and variety of the compositions, as well as Lortie’s performance, will make for fascinating and a deeply satisfying evening.\n\nLouis Lortie has earned an extraordinary international reputation as both a recitalist and a soloist with orchestras worldwide. Enjoy his program of Gabriel Fauré: Ballade in F-sharp major, Op. 19, Claude Debussy: Ballade, Johannes Brahms: Ballades, Op. 10 (Complete) and Franz Liszt: Ballade.\nCategories: Cultural, Live Performances, Music\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

Nous aurons une discussion rapide sur les différents ingrédients requis pour l’animation d’une marionnette pleine de personnalité, puis le vrai plaisir commencera. Nous construirons d'abord nos marionnettes en sac en papier, puis nous apprendrons à nous en servir !

    "description": "Join us and learn how to grow your own urban vegetable garden in this 4-part workshop.\n\n\nIn this 4-part workshop series, Toronto Master Gardeners will guide you through a variety of topics on Urban Vegetable Gardening with presentations, hands-on demonstrations, and exercises. From the process of garden planning to vegetable selection and seeding, these workshops will provide you with the knowledge and tools to create your own successful and productive garden. Everyone is welcome at this workshop, which is geared to novice and intermediate gardeners. \nSchedule: Wednesdays, March 18, 25, April 1 and 8 from 7 to 9 p.m. (four sessions). \nRegistration: Public $100, TBG Members $85 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nProgram Schedule: \nSession 1 – From Balconies to Backyards: Planning a Successful Vegetable Garden \nWednesday, March 18: \nAre you growing vegetables for the first time or aiming to increase the productivity of an existing vegetable patch? This session will highlight key factors to consider when planning a vegetable garden in a variety of growing spaces. Participants will have the opportunity to begin designing a garden plan with the help of a Toronto Master Gardener. A pre-measure or thought about size and area of your proposed garden is recommended. Basic sketching materials will be provided. Come prepared with your dreams & ideas! \nSession 2 – What does it all mean!? Demystifying gardening terminology and deciding what to plant! \nWednesday, March 25: \nFabaceae and Solanaceae, Heirloom, Open-pollinated and Hybrid – oh my! Gardening can feel like learning a new language. In this session we’ll demystify the terminology first, then work on choosing plants that will suit your conditions and thrive. Participants will learn key tips for reading seed catalogues and packets with confidence. Building on your garden plan this session will guide you in choosing specific vegetables to grow. Participants will learn about vegetable selection, planting strategies and begin work on their own personalized planting plan. \nSession 3 – Tips for a successful crop and plentiful harvest \nWedesday, April 1: \nIn this session, we’ll take a deeper dive into some of the most commonly grown vegetables, exploring their growth habits, plant care, disease prevention, and harvesting techniques. You’ll learn practical tips and tricks for producing a successful crop, along with strategies for extending the growing season and harvesting more than one crop from the same space. Participants are encouraged to bring a cell phone, iPad, or other WiFi-enabled device to join a fun Kahoot quiz! \nSession 4 – Starting Your Veggies From Seed \nWednesday, April 8: \nWould you like to grow veggies that have been in your family for generations, maybe even start homesteading, or perhaps (like many of us) just have fun experimenting with a home garden? From seed sowing to thinning plants, learning the difference between cotyledons and true leaves, knowing when to use warming pads or grow-lights … in this seminar you’ll learn everything you didn’t know you needed to know to start growing veggies and herbs from seed! Our workshop activity will be learning how to plant seeds and transplant seedlings. \nAbout Toronto Master Gardeners (TMG) \nToronto Master Gardeners (TMG) is a volunteer not-for-profit organization that shares current, science-based horticultural information with the gardening public through various channels, including in person, in print, through the media, and online.

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nHear talks from experts on the latest topics in AI, ML, and computer vision on March 19th.\n\n**Date and Location**\n\nMar 19, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/women-in-ai-meetup-march-19-2026)**\n\n**Towards Reliable Clinical AI: Evaluating Factuality, Robustness, and Real-World Performance of Large Language Models**\n\nLarge language models are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, but their reliability remains uncertain—they hallucinate facts, behave inconsistently across instruction phrasings, and struggle with evolving medical terminology. In my talk, I address methods to systematically evaluate clinical LLM reliability across four dimensions aligned with how healthcare professionals actually work: verifying concrete facts (FactEHR), ensuring stable guidance across instruction variations (instruction sensitivity study showing up to 0.6 AUROC variation), integrating up-to-date knowledge (BEACON improving biomedical NER by 15%), and assessing real patient conversations (PATIENT-EVAL revealing models abandon safety warnings when patients seek reassurance). These contributions establish evaluation standards spanning factuality, robustness, knowledge integration, and patient-centered communication, charting a path toward clinical AI that is safer, more equitable, and more trustworthy.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Monica Munnangi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monicamunnangi/) is a doctoral student at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by Saiph Savage. Her doctoral research, which she began in 2021 and expects to complete in 2026, focuses on multi-modal machine learning for healthcare. After being introduced to artificial intelligence and machine learning during her undergraduate studies, Munnangi earned her master’s degree from UMass Amherst.\n\n**Neural BRDFs: Learning Compact Representations for Material Appearance**\n\nAccurately modeling how light interacts with real-world materials remains a central challenge in rendering. Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) describe how materials reflect light as a function of viewing and lighting directions. Creating realistic digital materials has traditionally required choosing between fast parametric models that can't capture real-world complexity, or massive measured BRDFs that are expensive to acquire and store. Neural BRDFs address this challenge by learning continuous reflectance functions from data, exploiting directional correlations and symmetry to achieve significant compression while maintaining rendering quality. In this talk, we examine how neural networks can encode complex material behavior compactly, why this matters for rendering and material capture, and how neural BRDFs fit into the broader evolution toward data-driven graphics.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Manushree Gangwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manushreegangwar/) is a Machine Learning Engineer at Voxel51 working on data-centric visual AI. She holds an MS in Computer Science from Columbia University and has previously worked in robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR, with a focus on scene understanding and 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Supercharging AI agents with evaluations**\n\nReliable deployment of AI agents depends on rigorous evaluation, which must shift from a nice-to-have QA step to a core engineering discipline. Robust evaluation is essential for safety, predictability, misuse resistance, and sustained user trust. To meet this bar, Evals must be deeply integrated into the agent development lifecycle. This talk will outline how simulation-based testing—using high-fidelity, controllable environments—provides the next generation of evaluation infrastructure for production-ready AI agents.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Priya Venkat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priya26/), PhD, is a Senior AI Manager at Intuit, where she leads teams that build and scale ML and Agentic AI systems for finance. Her work integrates cutting-edge agentic workflows and robust evaluation systems to drive business impact while ensuring AI safety and reliability. Priya is a strong advocate of responsible AI, and actively mentors the next generation of AI scientists and engineers.\n\n**Language Diffusion Models**\n\nAutoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). Challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. Optimizing a likelihood bound provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Jayita Bhattacharyya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayita-bhattacharyya) is a AI ML Nerd with a blend of technical speaking & hackathon wizardry! Applying tech to solve real-world problems. The work focus these days is on generative AI. Helping software teams incorporate AI into transforming software engineering.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

Her book, Hegel’s Concept of Life: Self-Consciousness, Freedom, Logic (Oxford University Press, 2020), won the 2021 Journal of the History of Philosophy Book Prize. In addition to her research in post-Kantian philosophy, Dr. Ng is interested in the ongoing influence of Hegel and Marx for critical social theory, particularly as their legacies help us understand the relation between human beings and nature, possibilities and failures of mutual recognition, and conceptions of progress and critique. \nTalk Title\nTBD \nTalk Abstract\nTBD \nAbout the Continental Philosophy Group\nOne of six departmental research interest groups, the Continental Philosophy Group works in the traditions of textual interpretation of human consciousness, phenomenology, and post-structuralist critical theory, among other related traditions of thought.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

    "description": "A multi-modal brain-computer interface for restoring lost communication \nJoin in-person in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nRestoring the ability to communicate to people with neurological injuries has long been a goal of neurotechnology research; today, this dream is on the verge of fruition with ongoing commercial cursor and click brain-computer interface (BCI) clinical trials. I will describe our lab’s development of an intracortical speech BCI, which is the next frontier in restoring communication. First, we built a 99% word accuracy “brain-to-text” speech BCI. To this core capability, we’ve added neural cursor control over the participant’s personal computer (despite recording from orofacial cortex). We’ve also augmented text decoding with a loudness layer and a gesture (emoji) layer, both of which provide added expressivity, and we prototyped a neural error decoder which can reduce user frustration. Lastly, I’ll describe our progress towards an instantaneous voice synthesis BCI aimed at functionally replacing the paralyzed vocal system. \nSpeaker bio \n\nI’m a neuroscientist and neural engineer working at the intersection of systems and computational neuroscience, neural engineering, and machine learning. I’m trying to understand how the brain controls movements, and to use this knowledge to build brain-computer interface (BCIs) that treat brain injury and disease. My immediate goals are to develop BCIs for restoring speech. Closely related, I’m developing next-generation neural interfaces for human use. \nAs an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, Davis, I co-direct the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab . Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Stanford Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory led by Jaimie Henderson and Krishna Shenoy.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering",

    "description": "Join Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down, ground yourself, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation, open-ended art-making, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth, connection, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle, creative spaces that support care, growth, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork, offering a supportive space to reflect, connect, and simply be. \nPlease note, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Presence, arriving, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space, the body, and the group. This session focuses on grounding, safety, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness, inviting participants to notice texture, sound, colour, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature, others, ourselves. This session explores how we connect, separate, and relate—within ourselves, with others, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness, boundaries, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th, 2026 \nTheme: Growth, loss, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth, rest, grief, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration, personal meaning, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage. If you have any accessibility requirements during your program please email programsupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca.\nTo learn more about the Toronto Botanical Garden and our programs, please review our list of Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nSource: Toronto Botanical Garden",

    "description": "Post-Apocalyptic Book Club - Toronto Chapter\nOur next book will be We by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Here's the blurb:\n\nThe exhilarating dystopian novel that inspired George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadowed the worst excesses of Soviet Russia.\n\nYevgeny Zamyatin's *We* is a powerfully inventive vision that has influenced writers from George Orwell to Ayn Rand. In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over by the all-powerful 'Benefactor', the citizens of the totalitarian society of OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503, a mathematician who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the twenty-sixth century AD, *We* is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner of works such as George Orwell's *1984* and Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding cry for individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science fiction.\n\nNote for this book - there are a large variety of versions and translations!\nThe book is available here:\n\nAmazon- Paperback, eBook, Audiobook:\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/We-New-Yevgeny-Zamyatin/dp/0140185852/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1F40XUYQSJJR5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qtnfVTNJy7sDsVS0eoa9JtqB7JoGb8sAn0aoNr9Rfsc_cy-44iL7-uNztrGRAAfSgc0OOyZps2gind9jIK192fuDkP9C1GW0p-5icZpnVnkHroJKALac03KjwgbNFxRnm4GDhyEC0wJLjwhJVB7mfXJ_a0f2J7mXdKMiN7OznwQpOmxma-hl5BnUIj3BYMxPzpolK8-0otroPxbpgWlImLccJvVam7IlIjSavo_UJ3I.keBYwutgNiLNXMPGPfa2gwaQU_j60nv4Iou9lWThOXE&dib_tag=se&keywords=we+zamyatin&qid=1768345285&s=books&sprefix=we+zamyatin%2Cstripbooks%2C105&sr=1-1\n\nIndigo- Paperback:\nhttps://www.indigo.ca/en-ca/we-a-novel/9780771050220.html\n\nKobo- eBook:\nhttps://www.kobo.com/ca/en/ebook/we-2?sId=c05b9047-f00c-4d46-99ec-a975db6170b2&ssId=BBrkaNNgMIF1oXV-VzSs8&cPos=19\n\nToronto Public Library:\nhttps://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM530463&R=530463\n\nToronto Public Library- eBook https://toronto.overdrive.com/media/971F3D86-F246-4CB9-A3CB-94738696A77C\n\nProject Gutenberg:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61963\n\nSource: Meetup: Post-Apocalyptic Book Club",

Who has observed amorous salamanders, piscine stonemasons, or crooning tree crickets?  We are more aware of birds and the larger mammals, but there is a host of animals active underwater or after dark that are seldom noticed.  Others use camouflage to conceal their presence. Come to our March talk to hear Don Scallen share stories and show images about fish, caterpillars and other animals that slip under our radar. \nDon is a writer, naturalist, and former president of the Halton North Peel Naturalist Club. He is a regular contributor to an acclaimed regional magazine called In The Hills. https://www.inthehills.ca/author/don-scallen/  and has published two books: Nature Where We Live and Spotted Salamanders and their world” \n\n\nSource: Ontario Nature",

    "description": "Children across the country are growing up with constant reminders that our planet is under strain: shrinking wildlife populations, climate change, pollution, and habitats in decline. It’s a heavy weight for young shoulders, and many feel overwhelmed by what psychologists now call “eco-anxiety.” For children, the future seems daunting and hopeless. \nYet hope is within reach. \nIt begins with simple, joyful experiences outdoors, supported by caring adults and rooted in the places that children call home. When young people can explore nature, feel its rhythms, and take age-appropriate action on its behalf, they discover confidence, belonging, and their own capacity to make a difference. \nIn Peterborough, Ontario, a community-rooted initiative, recently honoured by the United Nations University as an Outstanding Flagship Project, is charting a new path forward. The Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship is a practical, inspiring guide for parents, educators, conservationists, and community leaders who want to help raise the next generation of Earth stewards. \nRooted in local ecosystems and strengthened by caring adult mentors, the Pathway model shows how simple, consistent engagements with nature can grow into a lifelong ethic of stewardship. It offers a hopeful, actionable roadmap for communities seeking to protect the places they love by empowering the young people who will inherit them. \nThis talk will share the story behind the Pathway and explore how conservation groups, educators, and citizens can work together to cultivate a generation ready to care for and care about the natural world. \n \n\nAbout Jacob Rodenburg \nJacob Rodenburg is an award-winning environmental educator with more than 35 years of experience inspiring children, youth, and communities to connect with the natural world. As Executive Director of Camp Kawartha and an instructor in Environmental Education at Trent University, he blends ecological literacy, experiential learning, and sustainability into innovative programs. Jacob is the co-creator of the Eco-Mentor Program and co-author of The Big Book of Nature Activities and The Wild Path Home: A Guide to Raising the Earth Stewards of Tomorrow as well as the author of the Book of Nature Connection. He co-led the development of the Pathway to Stewardship & Kinship Program, recently recognized as an Outstanding Flagship Project by the United Nations University. \n \n  \nPay What You Can \nrare strives to host community events for everyone with a ‘pay what you can’ model.

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

At a slow pace and in community with other participants and the environment, you will be guided by a series of invitations throughout the experience to awaken your senses and intentionally connect with nature in the present moment. \nWe will gather briefly indoors to prepare for the walk and consider the origin of Forest Bathing as well as some of the benefits of the practice. When we venture outside onsite, we will cover a loop of approx.1.5 Km on paved pathways, lawns and bare ground, at times encountering uneven terrain and inclines. We will be strolling, standing and sitting (if you wish to). Your comfort and safety are most important! As this program occurs rain or shine, please dress warmly for the weather and wear sturdy, closed-toed footwear. You may wish to bring a water bottle, a hat, mittens, sun glasses, walking poles and/or a folding stool or sitting/kneeling pad. \nAs the walk ends, we will gather and partake in a seasonal tea, snacks and taste honey harvested at Toronto Botanical Garden. \nIn the event of severe weather or environmental conditions, TBG staff will make alternative arrangements to the program. \nWashrooms are available onsite. \nThe program is suited for adults 18+. All participants must sign a liability waiver at the start of the program. \nFriday, March 27 from 1 to 3 p.m. \nRegistration: Public $35, TBG Members $30 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nAbout Laura Bincik \nLaura Bincik is a certified Forest Therapy guide with the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy. Following a career that straddled health care and education, Laura discovered that her lifelong sense of awe for the natural world could be enriched and shared with others to enhance wellbeing. Laura feels a connection to the land and the wonder of being in nature from countless hours spent exploring Toronto ravines in all seasons. An active member of Nature and Forest Therapy Canada, Laura follows the growing research on the mental and physical health benefits of Forest Bathing and is expanding her practice by connecting with local, national and international leaders in the field. \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden \nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

The best part is you get to choose the colors and arrange the flowers in your own style, making each piece a one‑of‑a‑kind creation that’s uniquely yours. \nBeginners welcome. All materials included. \nSaturday, March 28 from 2 to 4 p.m. \nRegistration: Public $50, TBG Members $45 (plus applicable taxes and fees). \nSuitable for ages 9+. \nAbout Deepa Krishnan \nDeepa Krishnan is a self-taught artist specializing in the art of Paper Quilling which involves manipulating narrow strips of paper to create exquisite designs. She discovered this art form when she was looking for a creative outlet from her engineering job. She was amazed by the possibilities and beauty of paper quilling, that she decided to pursue it as a full-time career. Since then, she has been passionately mastering this technique and has created many artworks drawing inspiration from nature, music and travel. She cuts the paper strips in different widths to add depth and dimension to her creations. She loves to play with the colours and experiment with the quilling techniques to create her own distinctive style. Deepa believes that anyone can learn this art form, regardless of their age or skill level and she hosts many workshops to spread the joy of quilling. She enjoys seeing her students discover their own creativity and style in paper quilling. \nWebsite: https://www.deepakrishnan.com/ \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden \nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

    "description": "A Book Club, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads \"**[The Age of Innocence](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM185033&R=185033)**\" by Edith Wharton\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/5169317438291968) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n\"Winner of the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, The Age of Innocence is Edith Wharton’s masterful portrait of desire and betrayal during the sumptuous Golden Age of Old New York, a time when society people “dreaded scandal more than disease.”\nThis is Newland Archer’s world as he prepares to marry the beautiful but conventional May Welland. But when the mysterious Countess Ellen Olenska returns to New York after a disastrous marriage, Archer falls deeply in love with her. Torn between duty and passion, Archer struggles to make a decision that will either courageously define his life—or mercilessly destroy it.\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53835.The_Age_of_Innocence))\n\n\"Set in the 1870s, the novel revolves around Newland Archer, a young lawyer from New York's high society, who is engaged to the beautiful and conventional May Welland. His life takes a turn when he meets May's cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, who has returned from Europe after leaving her scandalous husband. Torn between his duty and passion, Archer struggles with the constraints of the society he is a part of. The book offers a vivid portrayal of the struggle between individual desires and societal expectations in the upper-class New York society of the late 19th century.\" (from [The Greatest Books](https://thegreatestbooks.org/books/146))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in mind, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin our virtual Meetup to hear talks from experts on cutting-edge topics across AI, ML, and computer vision.\n\n**Date, Time and Location**\n\nApr 2, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/ai-ml-and-computer-vision-meetup-april-2-2026)**\n\n**Async Agents in Production: Failure Modes and Fixes**\n\nAs models improve, we are starting to build long-running, asynchronous agents such as deep research agents and browser agents that can execute multi-step workflows autonomously. These systems unlock new use cases, but they fail in ways that short-lived agents do not.\n\nThe longer an agent runs, the more early mistakes compound, and the more token usage grows through extended reasoning, retries, and tool calls. Patterns that work for request-response agents often break down, leading to unreliable behaviour and unpredictable costs.\n\nThis talk is aimed at use case developers, with secondary relevance for platform engineers. It covers the most common failure modes in async agents and practical design patterns for reducing error compounding and keeping token costs bounded in production.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Meryem Arik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meryemarik/) is the co-founder and CEO of Doubleword, where she works on large-scale LLM inference and production AI systems. She studied theoretical physics and philosophy at the University of Oxford. Meryem is a frequent conference speaker, including a TEDx speaker and a four-time highly rated speaker at QCon conferences. She was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for her work in AI infrastructure.\n\n**Visual AI at the Edge: Beyond the Model**\n\nEdge-based visual AI promises low latency, privacy, and real-time decision-making, but many projects struggle to move beyond successful demos. This talk explores what deploying visual AI at the edge really involves, shifting the focus from models to complete, operational systems. We will discuss common pitfalls teams encounter when moving from lab to field. Attendees will leave with a practical mental model for approaching edge vision projects more effectively.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[David Moser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-moser-dm/) is an AI/Computer Vision expert and Founding Engineer with a strong track record of building and deploying safety-critical visual AI systems in real-world environments. As Co-Founder of Orella Vision, he is building Visual AI for Autonomy on the Edge - going from data and models to production-grade edge deployments.\n\n**Sanitizing Evaluation Datasets: From Detection to Correction**\n\nWe generally accept that gold standard evaluation sets contain label noise, yet we rarely fix them because the engineering friction is too high. This talk presents a workflow to operationalize ground-truth auditing. We will demonstrate how to bridge the gap between algorithmic error detection and manual rectification. Specifically, we will show how to inspect discordant ground truth labels and correct them directly in-situ. The goal is to move to a fully trusted end-to-end evaluation pipeline.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Nick Lotz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholaslotz) is an engineer on the Voxel51 community team. With a background in open source infrastructure and a passion for developer enablement, Nick focuses on helping teams understand their tools and how to use them to ship faster.\n\n**Building enterprise agentic systems that scale**\n\nBuilding AI agents that work in demos is easy, building true assistants that make people genuinely productive takes a different set of patterns. This talk shares lessons from a multi-agent system at Cisco used by 2,000+ sellers daily, where we moved past \"chat with your data\" to encoding business workflows into true agentic systems people actually rely on to get work done.\n\nWe'll cover multi-agent orchestration patterns for complex workflows, the personalization and productivity features that drive adoption, and the enterprise foundations that helped us earn user trust at scale. You'll leave with an architecture and set of patterns that have been battle tested at enterprise scale.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Aman Sardana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amansardana/) is a Senior Engineering Architect at Cisco, I lead the design and deployment of enterprise AI systems that blend LLMs, data infrastructure, and customer experience to solve high‑stakes, real-world problems at scale. I’m also an open-source contributor and active mentor in the AI community, helping teams move from AI experimentation to reliable agentic applications in production.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

    "description": "The Global Philosophy Research Interest Group is delighted to welcome as guest speaker Sayeh Meisami, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Dayton. Dr. Meisami has published several books and articles in the fields of philosophy and religion. She is the author of Mulla Sadra (2013), Knowledge and Power in the Philosophies of Ḥamīd al-Dīn Kirmānī and Mullā Ṣadrā Shīrāzī (2018), and Nasir al-Din Tusi: A Philosopher for All Seasons (2019). In line with her interdisciplinary interests, her most recent articles demonstrate the significance of poetic techniques of thinking and writing in later Islamic philosophy and sufism, and her ongoing research is on the continuity of mythological and philosophical discourses in the Persianate context. \nTalk Title\nPoetic Thinking and the Divergent Philosophies of Rumi and Heidegger \nTalk Abstract\n\nThe talk is a critical analysis of Martin Heidegger’s engagement with “poetic thinking” by comparing it to that of Rumi’s. The comparison aims to investigate how a poetic thinker’s historical, cultural, and lived experiences fundamentally shape the ethical and sociopolitical outcomes of the discourses they create in their philosophies. I attempt to demonstrate that Heidegger correctly considers poetic thinking as a wholesome conflict between conceptualization and experiential finding that is essential to authentic human experience. This is exemplified by his reading of German lyrical voices, such as Hölderlin, that is conditioned by Eurocentrism and German exceptionalism.  I argue that both Heidegger and Rumi are great at poetic thinking and for this reason their starkly different lived experiences lead them to diverging directions:  Heidegger’s poetic thinking unleashes the “will to power”, and Rumi’s poetic thinking that is grounded in his experience as a multi-cultural immigrant and a lover gives rise to the “will to love.”  I will ultimately demonstrate that Rumi’s “will to love” functions as an interpretive/epistemic lens that justifies his philosophy of unity and inclusivity.   \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems, new questions and research directions, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy, and Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy in English, and classical Islamic philosophy.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nThis workshop provides a technical foundation for managing large scale computer vision datasets. You will learn to curate, visualize, and evaluate models using the [open source FiftyOne app](https://docs.voxel51.com/).\n\n**Date, Time and Location**\n\nApr 8, 2026\n10 AM PST - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/getting-started-with-fiftyone-april-8-2026)**\n\nThe session covers data ingestion, embedding visualization, and model failure analysis. You will build workflows to identify dataset bias, find annotation errors, and select informative samples for training. Attendees leave with a framework for data centric AI for research and production pipelines, prioritizing data quality over pure model iteration.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\n* **Structure unstructured data.** Map data and metadata into a queryable schema for images, videos, and point clouds.\n* **Query datasets with the FiftyOne SDK**. Create complex views based on model predictions, labels, and custom tags. Use the FiftyOne to filter data based on logical conditions and confidence scores.\n* **Visualize high dimensional embeddings**. Project features into lower dimensions to find clusters of similar samples. Identify data gaps and outliers using FiftyOne Brain.\n* **Automate data curation.** Implement algorithmic measures to select diverse subsets for training. Reduce labeling costs by prioritizing high entropy samples.\n* **Debug model performance.** Run evaluation routines to generate confusion matrices and precision recall curves. Visualize false positives and false negatives directly in the App to understand model failures.\n* **Customize FiftyOne**. Build custom dashboards and interactive panels. Create specialized views for domain specific tasks.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Working knowledge of Python and machine learning and/or computer vision fundamentals.\n* All attendees will get access to the tutorials and code examples used in the workshop.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

All DETAILS are below.\n\n***(Note--this trip is filling up)***\n\n**PLEASE READ** **EVERYTHING** over before signing on--everything you need to know is here. I'll try to make it work--but this trip is always in high demand.\n\n**There is a Non-Refundable fee to join us. Please Email me before signing up. All details are below. $150 per person.**\n\n[https://www.plural.art/en](https://www.plural.art/en)\n\nCan you join us for a mid-April/Spring 2026 long weekend! We have the best time in Montreal!\n\nSomething to look forward to--as Toronto winter approaches. We normally post these trips 4-6 months in advance. This trip is in just 4 months.\n\n--Each trip is unique, very organized, individual, and never to be repeated! For the culturally curious! Art/Food enthusiast. Explorers!\n\nWe can work off a group size of 15 people.\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT**: Please read all the information before signing up to this trip, as there is a **NON-refundable fee** involved upfront.\n\nCheck your schedules and calendars--and then double check them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Please do not sign up for the trip until you've emailed me. Very important.\n\nThese are very social trips--we are 'explorers'. Montreal treats us very well. We generally walk everywhere (thousands of steps!)\n\n**We will return to Plural Contemporary Art Fair for the *8th time*.**\n\n[https://www.plural.art/en](https://www.plural.art/en)\n\n**4 nights (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday--returning home on Sunday)**\n\n**Plural** celebrates the best of contemporary art in Canada. Created *by* and *for* the galleries, the fair presents and brings together the plurality of voices and works in contemporary art from across the country. It elevates art market practices through a rigorous selection of galleries presenting thoughtfully chosen artists and artworks; and through accessible programming that addresses current issues and questions in the field of art.\n\n**Plural's 19th edition** will be held from April 10-12th at the Port of Montreal’s Grand Quay. (Old Montreal). Just a fabulous space/btw. Old warehouse.\n\nIf you are familiar with Art Toronto and The Artist Project, then you have an idea about Papier Fair. **This is Quebec's most important Art Fair. 50 booths+**\n\n**Also, on the this trip**, we will visit OTHER larger Montreal galleries and explore various smaller galleries, food, public art, and architecture. We will meet artists, curators, and directors--with private tours. PLUS more.\n\n--We spend most of **ONE** day at the Fair, then the other time exploring Montreal's vibrant culture scene. After 20+ past trips, we are so fortunate to have many Montreal culture/gallery friends--they look forward to us/and we to them.\n\nOur full schedule of events is not finalized until late March 2026, but I keep you posted along the way (every month). **We meet as a group** before the trip in Toronto--mid/late March. TBD\n\nSpecial surprises always await us in Montreal!\n\n***Here is what you need to know to make a decision:***\n\n1. **I will** provide 3 1/2 days of cultural programming **on the ground**. Wednesday night, all day Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday. You return home on Sunday at your own time.\n2. **You are** responsible for your own travel, accommodation, insurance and other costs you will incur. In the past, members have travelled either by air, VIA, drive, Bus. They have stayed in hotels (points), Airbnb, Bed & Breakfast, Hostel, or with friends.\n\nBy planning ahead, you can get the best rates etc. VIA and accommodations.\n\nThere is no \"wrong\" place to stay in Montreal, but ideally you want to be about 1km/20 mins **walk** from St. Catherine St/Place des Arts.\n\n3\\. These are full trips\\, with very little \"free\\-time\"\\. We are on the go\\.\n4\\. On the Saturday night\\, we have a \"full Group\" restaurant dinner\\. About $125\\-$150 per person range\\. This is the only formal meal event I organize\\, although other meals fall into place while there\\.\n5\\. You would need to be in Montreal and ready to go by about 6pm on Wednesday April 8th\\, and you return home on your own time of choosing on Sunday April 13th\\.\n6\\. Can you attend\\, please be sure\\.\\.\\.\n\n**There is a non-refundable fee to participate in this trip, and you MUST connect with me before signing up on Meetup at:**\n\ntorontoisculture@gmail.com\n\nThe non-refundable fee is **$150 per person** payable within 2 days of signing up on Meetup.\n\n7\\. For your budgeting\\, **other** gallery/event \"entry\" costs may total $150 maximum over the weekend.\n8\\. By planning ahead\\, you can get the best rates on travel and accommodations\\. **Be proactive. By doing so, this covers your non-refundable fee. I travel by VIA, and stay at Airbnb.**\n9\\.

    "description": "Toronto AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nThis hands-on workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to building and evaluating visual agents for GUI automation using modern tools and techniques.\n\n**Date, Time and Location**\n\nApril 9, 2026 at 9 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom](https://voxel51.com/events/visual-agents-what-it-takes-to-build-an-agent-that-can-navigate-guis-like-humans-april-9-2026)**\n\nVisual agents that can understand and interact with graphical user interfaces represent a transformative frontier in AI automation. These systems combine computer vision, natural language understanding, and spatial reasoning to enable machines to navigate complex interfaces—from web applications to desktop software—just as humans do. However, building robust GUI agents requires careful attention to dataset curation, model evaluation, and iterative improvement workflows.\n\nParticipants will learn how to leverage [FiftyOne](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone), an open-source toolkit for dataset curation and computer vision workflows, to build production-ready GUI agent systems.\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\n\n* **Dataset Creation & Management:** How to structure, annotate, and load GUI interaction datasets using the COCO4GUI standardized format\n* **Data Exploration & Analysis:** Using FiftyOne's interactive interface to visualize datasets, analyze action distributions, and understand annotation patterns\n* **Multimodal Embeddings:** Computing embeddings for screenshots and UI element patches to enable similarity search and retrieval\n* **Model Inference:** Running state-of-the-art models like Microsoft's GUI-Actor to predict interaction points from natural language instructions\n* **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy using standard metrics and normalized click distance to assess localization precision\n* **Failure Analysis:** Investigating model failures through attention maps, error pattern analysis, and systematic debugging workflows\n* **Data-Driven Improvement:** Tagging samples based on error types (attention misalignment vs. localization errors) to prioritize fine-tuning efforts\n* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Using FiftyOne plugins to augment training data with synthetic task descriptions and variations\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Harpreet Sahota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harpreetsahota204/) is a hacker-in-residence and machine learning engineer with a passion for deep learning and generative AI. He’s got a deep interest in RAG, Agents, and Multimodal AI.\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto AI & ML",

    "description": "Toronto Enterprise DevOps User Group\nModern Microsoft Fabric projects often start with built‑in Git integration and deployment pipelines—but at enterprise scale, those capabilities alone are rarely sufficient. As environments grow in size and complexity teams need more advanced tools and patterns to manage Fabric artifacts reliably across development, test, and production.\n\nIn this session, we will:\n\\- Review common enterprise lifecycle challenges in Microsoft Fabric\n\\- Introduce advanced DevOps tooling and automation patterns used to address them\n\\- Walk through a realistic implementation pattern that shows how these tools fit together in practice\n\nThis session is designed for data and platform engineers and architects responsible for operating Microsoft Fabric in production. If you’re already using Git integration and deployment pipelines and are looking to extend them with more scalable, repeatable, and enterprise‑ready CI/CD practices, this session will help you understand when and how to go beyond the defaults.\n\n*Come at 5:30 pm have some pizza and chat for a bit. The presentation starts at 6:00 pm.*\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Enterprise DevOps",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

Dr. Beaulieu works broadly in the fields of epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics, with his research to date focusing primarily on absence. He is currently working on issues related to introspection and iterated knowledge, especially whether the former offers a route into the latter. Dr. Beaulieu also maintains active teaching interests in philosophy of disability. \nTalk Title\nTBD \nTalk Abstract\n\nTBD \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems, new questions and research directions, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy, and Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy in English, and classical Islamic philosophy.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy",

All participants will go home with a dip pen handle, metal drawing nip and small bottle of black walnut ink made at Toronto Botanical Garden! \nNo experience is required; just bring your curiosity and enthusiasm! \nBeginners welcome. \nMaterials are included.

Alan’s mission is to build connections to nature through arts-based education. Since 2015, he has been partnering with non-profit environmental organizations to teach nature-focused art programs and workshops. \nAlan was responsible for the successful launch of the Toronto Nature Sketch program in 2018, teaching all of the art lessons during that inaugural year. Nature Sketch is an initiative of Canadian artist Robert Bateman and the Bateman Foundation. \nIn 2019, Alan was a speaker at the annual Ravine Symposium at Toronto Botanical Garden. In his presentation, he shared stories behind ravine-inspired artwork created by himself and a small brigade of volunteer artists. Funds raised through the sale of the artwork were donated to ravine conservation initiatives at the garden. \nAlan currently teaches Field Sketching, Nature Drawing and Linocut Printmaking at Toronto Botanical Garden and the High Park Nature Centre. \nwww.alanlidrawings.com \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program, upcoming events and classes, and free parking.

Despite her callous management style, the cooks learn to reclaim their lives, find purpose, and become inspired to dream by their shared quest to create the perfect sandwich. A buoyant play full of witty dialogue, Clyde’s is a transcendent story about second chances, rising above past mistakes, and reconnecting with the world.  \n\nFull of sizzling wit, big heart, and mouthwatering ambition, Clyde’s serves up a thrilling, high-energy ride—think The Bear meets Broadway. Helmed by returning director Philip Akin (The Lehman Trilogy, Fat Ham), an all-star Canadian cast takes on this deliciously funny and deeply moving play. \nCategories: Live Performances, Theatre\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

In \"A Temporary Matter,\" published in The New Yorker, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant.\" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies))\n\n\"With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence, Jhumpa Lahiri traces the crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants, expatriates, and their children arrive, quite literally, at a cultural divide.\nA blackout forces a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tattered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural identity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakastani civil war rages on television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession.\nImbued with the sensual details of Indian culture, these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner. Like the interpreter of the title story, Lahiri translates between the strict traditions of her ancestors and a baffling new world.\" (from the [Toronto Public Library](https://tpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S234C194772))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more information, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in mind, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long, available from the Toronto Public Library, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown",

Inspired by the real-life daughter of Miguel de Cervantes, the book follows fifteen-year-old Isabel as she navigates secrecy, love, and survival in a patriarchal world while her father works on Don Quixote. Through richly detailed prose, Bátiz gives voice to the women who lived in the shadows of history, blending drama, resilience and untold stories.\n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni. Each in-person event features readings, discussions, Q&A, book signings and ASL interpretation, while virtual sessions include live subtitles and audio access.\nCategories: Literary\n\nSource: City of Toronto Festivals & Events",

    "description": "Perception solutions for enabling automated driving in winter conditions \nJoin in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nThis talk presents methods and findings from research on perception solutions for automated driving in winter conditions, carried out at the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory, Aalto University. Winter conditions pose several challenges for automated vehicle perception pipelines, which currently limit the applicability of the technology in adverse weather conditions. The talk focuses on two main research directions: denoising snowflakes from LiDAR data and road segmentation in snowy conditions. Airborne snowflakes introduce significant noise into LiDAR scans, which can hinder downstream perception tasks. To address this challenge, the talk presents deep learning approaches for point cloud denoising based on both supervised and self-supervised learning. In addition, snowy conditions drastically alter the visual appearance of the environment and the road, rendering road segmentation methods trained on traditional datasets unreliable. To overcome this, trajectory-based approaches leveraging vision foundation models are presented for learning varied road appearance without requiring manual labeling. \nSpeaker bio \nRisto Ojala (DSc, Tech) is an Assistant Professor at Aalto University, Finland, where he leads the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory within the Mechatronics research group. His research focuses on intelligent vehicles and mobile robotics, with particular emphasis on perception, sensor fusion, and applied machine learning for autonomous systems. He is also currently a Visiting Scholar at Simon Fraser University, Canada, collaborating with the Multi-Agent Robotic Systems Laboratory on research in semantic understanding for mobile robotics. His work develops perception solutions that enable robust autonomous operation in challenging environments. A central application of his research is automated driving in winter conditions, addressing problems such as scene understanding, situational awareness, and perception reliability. His work has been published in leading robotics and intelligent transportation venues and he collaborates closely with both academic and industrial partners.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering",

    "description": "The Sci Fi Book Club\nBook of the Month:\n“The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025”\nEditors: John Joseph Adams, Nnedi Okorafor\n\nThis month we are keeping a beloved Sci Fi Book Club tradition alive. For the eleventh year in a row (wow, still can't believe that's right), we will be reading the newest edition of a short story collection called *The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy*. It has been a Club favorite each year and takes a look at the current state of science fiction by highlighting some new and established writers in the genre. Each story has to meet certain criteria that you can read up on at the editor’s website, and is chosen without the author’s name attached.\n\nStories are selected by John Joseph Adams and this year's guest editor, Nnedi Okorafor. Okorafor has appeared in this collection before and is best known for novels like *Who Fears Death*, *Binti*, *and* Lagoon (a Book Club selection back in 2018). She is celebrated for imaginative storytelling that is deeply rooted in African cultures, myths, and histories. Her work often blends Africanfuturism with speculative fiction, highlighting marginalized perspectives and exploring futures where myth and science coexist.\n\nIt's always interesting to see what themes and premonitions make their way into the writing zeitgeist in a given year. From [Adams' website](https://www.johnjosephadams.com/projects/best-american-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2025/) \"The twenty stories in this collection simultaneously fulfill and defy expectations of genre, showcasing boundary-pushing authors at their best..From the joyous, to the terrifying, to the heart-wrenching and the absurd, these stories encourage you to open your mind and, as Okorafor promises, 'Watch your world expand.'\"\n\nPer usual, I recommend coming back around to the Introduction by Okorafor once you've read the stories, as it sometimes contains spoilers. The Preface is worth it, for sure! It describes the selection process.\n\nLet us know in the Comments below which stories you like, and feel free to skip one if you’re not digging it. There are always plenty of perspectives and approaches to the format in this collection.\n\n*The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025* is available in paperback and audiobook via Amazon and other online booksellers, and is also available via the New York Public Library.\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting, all you will need is YOURSELF! If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book, we still would love for you to join us in the discussion.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sci Fi Book Club",

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers.

For two Fridays each month, our Studio theatre is transformed into a cozy playspace with soft surfaces, sensory-friendly toys, and activities that spark imaginative play and meaningful interactions between little ones and their grownups. Unique to this program are special 30-minute song circles that fuse music, drama, and play, led by guest artist-educators: Pete Moss and Songs with Nash.\n\nWhat is open playtime?\nOpen playtime is a period of unstructured play where children engage in activities of their own choosing, without specific rules or guidance. It plays an important role in child development, helping to foster creativity, problem solving, social skills, and emotional regulation.\n\nFriday Playdate is a part of Room for Play, YPT's newest program for young children ages 0 months - 5 years old and their caregivers. Learn more about Room for Play here: https://www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/room-for-play/ www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/room-for-play/ https://www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/room-for-play/\n\nSource: St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association",

    "description": "The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi all,\n\nFor May, we will be reading another short story collection. Following April’s selection, *Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025*, we’ll turn to an older anthology. This collection features stories by a science fiction writer who remained cloaked in mystery for years.\n\nBook of the Month\n*Her Smoke Rose Up Forever* \\- James Tiptree Jr\\. \\(1990\\)\n\nDirect from [this amazing Portalist](https://theportalist.com/james-tiptree-jr-enigmatic-author) article:\n\"James Tiptree Jr. left an enduring mark on modern speculative fiction — but she’s perhaps more mysterious and enigmatic today than ever before.\n\nTiptree was one of the pen names used by female sci-fi author Alice Bradley Sheldon (née Alice Hastings Bradley). The daughter of prolific fiction writer Mary Hastings Bradley, Sheldon may have been born with the gift of words, but her path to literary success wasn’t clear-cut.\n\nAlthough Sheldon is best known for her sci-fi writing, she had an eclectic and accomplished career. At various times in her life, Sheldon was a research psychologist, painter, art critic, imagery intelligence operative, CIA operative, and more. In many of these fields, she was one of the few women in an industry dominated by men. \"\n\nGiven this and Tiptree's well-known stories included in this collection, I don't think we can pass up this opportunity. As with any other collection we read for Book Club, if a story isn't speaking to you, go ahead and skip it! There are 18 selections in here, I'm sure we'll have plenty to discuss.\n\nBelow, you'll find a few notables and a brief description:\n\n* “The Women Men Don’t See” – A classic feminist sci-fi story exploring gender, invisibility, and societal expectations.\n* “Houston, Houston, Do You Read?” – A Hugo Award–winning story about time travel, gender, and post-apocalyptic society.\n* “Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death” – A highly acclaimed story told from the perspective of an alien species, exploring instinct, love, and survival.\n* “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” – A groundbreaking cyberpunk-like story about identity, media, and corporate control of bodies.\n* “And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill’s Side” – A dark, unsettling exploration of obsession and desire for alien contact.\n\nThere are a few printings of this collections. I think [I'm going to pick up this one](https://bookshop.org/p/books/her-smoke-rose-up-forever-james-tiptree/163a6a04d0124023?ean=9781892391209&next=t&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%7Bcampaignname%7D&utm_content=6443417794&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=16235479093&gbraid=0AAAAACfld43fka72FJRQfybRz8siTTDOZ&gclid=Cj0KCQiAprLLBhCMARIsAEDhdPdhUhUk1aiXVGaWtVIu9frZcido-IwCeX0rcqajtxQRQLphaxpwy68aAvCqEALw_wcB), as it includes some revisions from the author’s original notes.\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting, all you will need is YOURSELF. If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book, we still would love for you to join us in the discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for events? [The Sci Fi Book Club is on Discord](https://discord.gg/MM3hNQFW). Join us and keep the conversation going.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sci Fi Book Club",

His life is dominated by the place and the thriving black market in the alien products. But when he and his friend Kirill go into the Zone together to pick up a “full empty,” something goes wrong. And the news he gets from his girlfriend upon his return makes it inevitable that he’ll keep going back to the Zone, again and again, until he finds the answer to all his problems.\n\nFirst published in 1972, *Roadside Picnic* is still widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction novels.\n\nThe book is available here:\n\nAmazon- Paperback, eBook, Audiobook:\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Roadside-Picnic-Arkady-Strugatsky/dp/1613743416/ref=sr_1_1?crid=4CF8Z2KM9FR5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OkKU7AC1WfScTlwfheDPnXc6RoH27bTDKMyfAgC_JANost0NCKJUcjZqbrLEile8IathzFMmAmFe9oXiUWLxKh0sg2kayNmgEhJeLKnThaxDk_9Nmn1yHf77Bct23OqBlVzxGEpNppD1tjZHWL0s7jQ4OA2YCoqJ5wL-eUmc8we34pauk-oG5kcohPzDgi_je8CjkyuMZtBD9FL-ijN8lzwv7OthBw_4PRiTvvZPAoimmLqGW3osojbapjD2J2EwKkDSsW8nh6xzHTdnXuVZKsuwVD2Pb6_99nT4Yqhn-WU.W4eSQPh8pV3pjNwYowMlY_NWsCM75jm2_aqs1Z4WAl0&dib_tag=se&keywords=roadside+picnic&qid=1768352378&sprefix=roadside+picnic%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-1\n\nIndigo- Paperback:\nhttps://www.indigo.ca/en-ca/roadside-picnic/9781613743416.html\n\nKobo- eBook:\nhttps://www.kobo.com/ca/en/ebook/roadside-picnic-1?sId=a2633ff7-55e3-4248-88ad-9f7fedb4c18f&ssId=1AYtAyk0vt3KTVdGTn8zv&cPos=1\n\nToronto Public Library:\nhttps://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2898868&R=2898868\n\nToronto Public Library- eBook https://toronto.overdrive.com/media/1075415\n\nSource: Meetup: Post-Apocalyptic Book Club",

    "description": "The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone,\n\nOur novel for June came in at a close second for contemporary picks on our survey. The story takes place around a devastating flu pandemic that threatens society as we know it. It's often cited as one of the more prophetic novels of recent times, but takes things well beyond the covid pandemic.\n\nBook of the Month\n*Station Eleven -* Emily St. John Mandel (2014)\n\nFrom [Grimdark Magazine](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel/), \"*Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel takes the best parts of the dystopian science fiction and fantasy genre and does one thing most books can’t, give the reader hope.\" I really like the way [A Little Book Problem](https://alittlebookproblem.co.uk/2023/08/04/book-review-station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel-book-6-of-20booksofsummer/#:~:text=The%20book%20is%20a%20beautiful%2C,to%20in%20a%20world%20when)'s review describes the tone. \"The book is a beautiful, heart-wrenching and moving exploration of what is important to us in life, what we would hang on to in a world when almost everything we know and care about is torn away, and what kind of people we discover we are in the face of great adversity.\"\n\n*Station Eleven* shows how science fiction isn’t just about the future. It’s about how we live today, and the threads that connect us all. It's a celebration of the arts and bound to be a great conversation. I look forward to discussing this one with you!\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting, all you will need is YOURSELF. If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book, we still would love for you to join us in the discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for events? [The Sci Fi Book Club is on Discord](https://discord.gg/B9NMnC2F). Join us and keep the conversation going.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sci Fi Book Club",

    "description": "The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone,\n\nOur selection for July is short but mighty story, and I'm here for it. It has been rediscovered recently on BookTok and is being compared to books like Margaret Atwood’s *A Handmaid's Tale* and Octavia E Butler’s *Parable* series. Translated from French and published in 1995 then slipped into relative obscurity. The themes are intense but I'm told that the storytelling and the message are well worth it. If you're interested in learning more about the book's resurgence, check out this great [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/01/i-who-have-never-known-men-lost-dystopia-new-readers-after-buzz-on-tiktok).\n\nBook of the Month\n*I Who Have Never Known Men* \\- Jacqueline Harpman \\(1995\\)\n\nFrom Goodreads, *I Who Have Never Known Men* is a story about a group of women imprisoned and guarded. The women have no memory of how they got there, no notion of time, and only a vague recollection of their lives before. What comes next is a story of a young woman's fight to uncover her past and make her own future. People are divided on the story's finer points, but just about everyone I've read has echoed [What Is Quinn Reading](https://www.whatisquinnreading.com/reviews/i-who-have-never-known-men-book-review)'s review, saying they're grateful for the read and will carry it with them. At approximately 190 pages, I'm glad you'all feel that we should dive in and investigate this kind of story.\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting, all you will need is YOURSELF. If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book, we still would love for you to join us in the discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for events? [The Sci Fi Book Club is on Discord](https://discord.gg/B9NMnC2F). Join us and keep the conversation going.\n\nSource: Meetup: Sci Fi Book Club",

All programming is free and open to the public.\n\nIn association with the festival, TO Live will be installing a temporary outdoor stage and closing Scott Street from Front Street East to Scott Lane. This location will serve as one of two performance stages, showcasing Indigenous artists from across Canada at no cost to attendees. This will require the temporary closure of this section of Scott Street to motor vehicles. Front Street will remain open to ongoing traffic.\n\nIn addition, there will be a pedestrian Indigenous marketplace along Scott Street from Front Street to Wellington Street and throughout Berczy Park. This marketplace will feature Indigenous artisan vendors, food trucks, pop-up food tents. As part of this activation, Scott Street south of the public parking lot will also be closed to motor vehicles. Neither of the Public parking lots on Scott Street will be blocked.\n\nAlongside the marketplace, the existing platform within Berczy Park will become a second performance stage to fully animate the park and surrounding area.\n\nStreet closures will commence at 12:00 a.m. on August 14, 2025, and remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. on August 16, 2025.\n\nProgramming hours will be approximately 12:00 p.m.–10:00 p.m. on August 14, and 10:00 a.m.–10:00 p.m. on August 15 and 16.\n\nTO Live welcomes the St. Lawrence community to this free and inclusive celebration of Indigenous arts and culture.
