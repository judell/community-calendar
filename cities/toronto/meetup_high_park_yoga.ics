SUMMARY:Breath\, Sweat and Chills
DESCRIPTION:High Park Yoga\nJoin us for a **120-minute ultra-sensory journ
 ey** through breath\, heat\, and ice. The cost for this event is $45 pp\, 
 please **[buy your ticket here.](https://www.breathinginnature.com/product
 /breath-sweat-and-chills-wild-breath-journey/)** Only 25 seats!\n\n**The B
 reath**\nWe begin with guided breathwork in the warm sauna as the drum bea
 ts in time with your heart\, calling you deeper into your body\, into the 
 primal rhythms of the soul.\n**The Sweat**\nIn the post-breath bliss – t
 he heat rises. The sauna becomes a womb of transformation\, the sweat risi
 ng as layers fall away. Old energies melt. Boundaries dissolve. You become
  pure presence.\n**The Cold**\nWhen you’re ready—plunge into one of th
 e five ice baths. Shudder\, shake\, and shiver away the stagnant energy th
 at no longer serves. Feel the fire of your own vitality reignite as the co
 ld awakens every cell.\n\nRinse and repeat as needed\, moving through cont
 rast therapy throughout the evening. Enjoy social time at Revive afterward
 s.\n\nCheck your emails for confirmation and the link to the waiver for Re
