SUMMARY:In Search of Imperfection: The Macdonald Collection of Japanese and Japanese-Inspired Ceramics
DESCRIPTION:In Search of Imperfection: The Macdonald Collection of Japanese and Japanese-Inspired Ceramics                                                                          \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n	\n\n	\n\n\n			\nEvents\n	\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    Ongoing\nJoan Courtois Gallery.

The Macdonalds’ collecting journey was first sparked by an admiration for the imperfect beauty of early Japanese porcelain often characterized by a taste for asymmetry\, spontaneous decoration\, or uneven shapes. What they called an “adventure in search of imperfection” led to the formation of a unique collection that traces the rise of Arita’s porcelain industry while highlighting the role of ceramics in fostering global connections. At the heart of their vision was a desire to demonstrate how Japanese Kakiemon-style porcelain functioned as both a vehicle for the exchange of ideas and a source of inspiration for makers in other parts of the world. \nFor the first time\, the Macdonald Collection is on view in its entirety throughout the Museum. Spanning the three levels of the Museum’s stairwell\, the Courtois Gallery features a special display that invites you to discover Japanese porcelain from the early Edo period (1603–1868) and Japanese-inspired ceramics through the themes of nature\, leisure\, and global trade. Continue your visit in the Macdonald Gallery of Japanese Porcelain and Its Influence on the second floor to delve deeper into some of these histories. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n	\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n  Download the Object Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                              Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid \n\n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                              Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid \n\n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                              Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid \n\n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                              Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid \n\n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                              Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid \n\n                          \n          \n        \n\n          \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n

SUMMARY:Linda Rotua Sormin: Uncertain Ground

The exhibition asks how life in the modern\, cosmopolitan city can coexist with memories and experiences of our ancestral traditions. \nRaised in Canada and Thailand\, artist Linda Rotua Sormin has emerged as a leading voice in sculpture with her fearless\, monumental structures. Continually pushing clay beyond its limits\, Sormin’s web-like forms burst through the boundaries of the medium\, literally breaking apart and re-convening in new forms. Colonial artifacts\, everyday kitsch\, and fragments from the artist’s studio floor dangle and nestle within the latticework. \nIn her first solo museum exhibition and largest project to date\, Sormin delves into her lineage among the Batak people of Sumatra in the Indonesian archipelago\, exploring how images and ideas of her ancestors have\, sometimes unwittingly\, infused her artistic practice. She studied traditional Batak divination books\, available to her only in European museum collections\, with access strictly controlled\, as well as the script and spoken language of her ancestors. Building on her research\, Sormin weaves a rich family history of shamanic and other spiritual practices fragmented by colonialism\, Christianization\, and diaspora. \nThe exhibition unfolds on three levels: a central raised platform evokes a volcanic lake with an underworld of mythical beasts and coded divination texts; a tangle of precarious ceramic sculptures suggests an earthly middle ground inhabited by humans; and a suspended projection screen references a celestial realm of spirits and birds. The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion\, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative. \nPlease note: This exhibition contains a video projection with flashing lights. \nClick here for more accessibility information. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                       \n            \n                \n                    About the Artist\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Born in Bangkok\, Thailand\, Linda Rotua Sormin moved to Canada with her family at the age of five. Her sculptures and site-responsive installations embody the vulnerable and fragmentary nature of her diasporic experience. Since the early 2000s\, she has established a distinct visual and material language\, using raw clay\, fired ceramics\, found objects\, and interactive methods. \nSormin’s research and writing cast light on how her work has always been influenced—though at times unwittingly—by cultural practices in her family histories rooted in Thailand\, China\, and Indonesia. Advocating for decolonial approaches in art and education since the early 1990s when she worked in community development in Laos\, she has since taught visual art at Emily Carr University\, Rhode Island School of Design\, Sheridan College\, Alfred University\, and currently New York University\, where she is a tenured Professor of Studio Art and Head of Ceramics. \nHer work is included in private and public collections including the permanent collections of the Gardiner Museum (Toronto\, ON\, Canada)\, Museum of Fine Arts Boston (Boston\, MA\, USA)\, Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington\, DC\, USA)\, and Victoria & Albert Museum (London\, UK). \nSormin lives and works in New York City. \nPhoto: David Schmitz \n                            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n                               \n                  \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        Linda Rotua Sormin discusses her exhibition at the Gardiner Museum. \nRecorded on November 4\, 2025. \n \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n      \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n            \n                          \n          \n        \n\n          \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n                      \n                Exhibition Programs\n            \n            \n                            \n                Join us for special exhibition programs including talks\, tours\, and more! \n \n            \n                \n            \n                                     \n                    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n              \n                                            \n        \n        \n        \n        \n                        \n                        \n        \n               \n        \n                    \n                \n                        \n                \n            \n                                    \n                Family Recipes: Multimedia Illustration Workshop\n                \n            \n                         \n                Feb 17 2026 @ 5:30 pm\n                                                    \n                Join artist Breanne Bradshaw for a workshop inspired by the exhibition Linda Rotua Sormin: Uncertain Ground.

Pleasant Smells and Warm Fellowships: Scent in Islamic Ceramics asks us to foreground our noses\, imagining the rich and intoxicating scents ceramics have elicited\, especially when shared with others. \nThe exhibition evokes a common smellscape—an olfactory social environment—Muslim women have and continue to cultivate: the home or harem. Artists Elif Uras\, Kaashif Ghanie\, and Leila Fatemi present distinct cultural explorations of scent in feminized spaces including domestic settings. The contemporary artworks are juxtaposed with historical objects to reveal an interconnected and fragrant social sphere amongst diverse cultures in enduring contact with the Islamic world. Scent becomes the connector: to home\, to others\, and between cultures. \nThe Gardiner Museum Curatorial Residency is made possible through the generous support of the Rebanks Family. \nSupport for Elif Uras is provided by SAHA Association. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                       \n            \n                \n                    About the Artist \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Elif Uras\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Elif Uras (b. Ankara) attended Brown University and Columbia Law School before receiving a BFA from School of Visual Arts and and MFA from Columbia School of the Arts. Her practice spans ceramics\, drawing\, and painting. She frequently employs labor intensive intricate patterns on her surfaces inspired by diverse art historic sources including Prehistoric art\, antiquity\, Islamic geometry\, Iznik tiles and Western modernism. Her work also engages with questions of tradition\, ornament\, and labor\, especially feminized labor. Often working on location in Iznik (Nicaea)\, where the most renowned tiles and ceramics of the Ottoman Empire were produced centuries ago\, Uras produces works in ceramic that incorporate the non-figurative visual vocabulary of Iznik with the female body. \n                            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                       \n            \n                \n                    About the Artist\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Kaashif Ghanie\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Kaashif Ghanie (he/him) is a first-generation Guyanese Canadian Muslim ceramic and visual artist based in Kjipuktuk/Halifax. He works at Wonder’neath Art Society and KG Ceramics Studio\, which he co-runs with his partner\, Kate Grey. Ghanie’s practice integrates historical Islamic vessel forms with motifs drawn from family prayer rugs\, creating a contemporary visual language rooted in cultural memory and identity. He holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Ceramics with a minor in Art History from NSCAD University (2016). \n                            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                       \n            \n                \n                    About the Artist\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Leila Fatemi \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Leila Fatemi (b. 1991\, Milan) is a contemporary visual artist currently based in Tkaronto/Toronto. Through a combination of material and textual research\, her practice unfolds across a variety of mediums including photography\, collage\, archival materials\, textile\, pattern and printmaking. Bridging themes of postcolonialism\, gender\, and spirituality\, Fatemi’s work challenges viewers to consider their role in relation to the representational accuracy and cultural consequences of Orientalized subjects. Her work offers alternative perspectives surrounding the colonial gaze\, ethnic representation\, and collective numinous experiences by employing methods of subversion and reclamation as tools to resist imperialist legacies. \n                            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                       \n            \n                \n                    About the Curator\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Regatu Asefa\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Regatu Asefa (she/her) is a curator and art historian based in Toronto and Oxford\, where she is completing her MPhil in Islamic Art and Architecture.

Studio members made the works on display through a series of workshops led by local ceramic artists Japneet Kaur\, Zoë Pinnell\, and Nurielle Stern. In the workshops\, each artist shared their particular approach\, which the participants adapted to their own ways of making. The series sought to strengthen technical skills\, broaden conceptual strategies\, and build professional networks. \nFor many Inspirations Studio members\, intersecting systemic barriers and the lack of accessible art spaces in the GTA have hindered opportunities for artistic growth. This workshop series aimed to address this imbalance. Presenting the resulting artworks at the Gardiner Museum highlights the work of Inspirations Studio and its members\, while offering space for new narratives to emerge. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    About Inspirations Studios \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    Inspirations Studio was founded in 1994 to provide studio access\, storefront selling opportunities\, arts education\, and professional training opportunities to women who have experienced multiple forms of discrimination. The Studio’s core mission is to contribute to improving women’s lives through the making and selling of pottery. Through creative\, therapeutic\, and skill-building work\, women gain self-confidence and stability while connecting to community. Studio members also gain a source of supplemental income and find a new way to engage with the world as makers. Art—and ceramics in particular—can bring change and offer healing\, while giving people purpose\, pride\, passion\, and joy. Inspirations Studio workshop and storefront space is located at 389 Church St\, on the main floor of YWCA Toronto’s supportive housing building.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                     \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion\, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n  \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n

This once-in-a-generation renovation reimagined the Gardiner’ss role as an inspiring and accessible community-driven hub where clay serves as a bridge between cultures\, histories\, and people. Designed by Montgomery Sisam Architects and Andrew Jones Design\, in collaboration with architect Chris Cornelius of studio:indigenous\, the transformation of the Gardiner’s 9\,000-square-foot ground floor was guided by the principles of connectivity\, access\, and Indigeneity. It features new Collection Galleries\, a fully equipped Makerspace\, a Community Learning Centre\, and the Gardiner’s first-ever gallery of Indigenous ceramics.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n

Pleasant Smells and Warm Fellowships: Scent in Islamic Ceramics asks us to foreground our noses\, imagining the rich and intoxicating scents ceramics have elicited\, especially when shared with others. The exhibition evokes a common smellscape—an olfactory social environment—Muslim women have and continue to cultivate: the home or harem.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                       \n            \n                \n                    Rubia Homa \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Rubia Homa is a perfumer from Burlington\, Ontario.
