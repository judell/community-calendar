SUMMARY:$5.99 afternoon movie. Best In Show at Imagine Cinema Carlton
DESCRIPTION:Toronto Movies & Social Group - Celebrating 14 Years!\n🎬
 🐾 **Meetup Movie Matinee: *Best In Show* at Imagine Cinema Carlton** 
 🐾🎬\n**Saturday February 21 \\| 3:40PM Show \\| Only $5\\.99**\n\nAs 
 some of you know\, while I don't currently own a dog of my own\, I frequen
 tly borrow some for Meetup adventures. I couldn't miss this one especially
  after news Catherine O'Hara's passing.\n\nDog lovers\, comedy fans\, and 
 anyone who appreciates brilliantly awkward humour — this one’s for you
 .\nWe’re heading to **Best in Show** at **Imagine Cinemas Carlton** for 
 the 3:40PM screening in **Auditorium 4**.\n\n🎟 **Tickets are just $5.99
 **\nPurchase in person or online here:\n[https://omniwebticketing6.com/ima
 ginecinemas/carlton/?schdate=2026-02-21&perfix=133459](https://omniwebtick
 eting6.com/imaginecinemas/carlton/?schdate=2026-02-21&perfix=133459)\n\n**
 *\n\n### 🐩 About the Movie\n\nDirected by Christopher Guest\, *Best In 
 Show* (2000) is a mockumentary-style comedy that follows five delightfully
  eccentric dog owners as they prepare for the prestigious Mayflower Kennel
  Club Dog Show.\nWith a pitch-perfect ensemble cast — including the inco
 mparable **Catherine O'Hara** — the film hilariously captures the intens
 e devotion\, neuroses\, and unconditional love between humans and their fo
 ur-legged companions.\n\n⏱ **Run Time:** 1 hour 30 minutes\n▶️ **Wat
 ch the trailer:**\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94y9n9lNy2Y](https://w
 ww.youtube.com/watch?v=94y9n9lNy2Y)\n\n***\n\n### 💛 Why This Screening 
 Feels Special\n\nFollowing the recent passing of Catherine O’Hara\, this
  screening feels especially meaningful. Her performance as Cookie Fleck 
 — warm\, chaotic\, and endlessly quotable — is one of the great comedi
 c character roles of the early 2000s. Watching her here is a reminder of h
 ow much joy she brought to audiences\, especially us Canadians who proudly
  claim her.\nThis is a chance to laugh together and celebrate her legacy.\
 n\n***\n\n### 🐕 Perfect for Dog Lovers\n\nIf you:\n\n* Have a dog\n* Lo
 ve dogs\n* Once made your pet wear a ridiculous outfit\n* Or secretly beli
 eve your pup could win Best In Show\n\n…this movie understands you. Deep
 ly.\nExpect pure-bred chaos\, competitive spirit\, and surprisingly heartf
 elt moments about the bonds we share with our pets.\n\n***\n\n### 📍 Mee
 tup Details\n\n* **Arrive by 3:25PM** so we can gather before heading in.\
 n* Look for **Nick and a Meetup sign outside Auditorium 4** before and aft
 er the movie.\n* We’ll hang out briefly afterward to share favourite lin
 es and moments.\n\nLow-cost. Big laughs. Lots of dogs.\nHope you’ll join
  us! 🐶✨\n\nRemember you can just show up if unsure of your schedule
