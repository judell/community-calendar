SUMMARY:Unionnale: Aura by Jason Zante
DESCRIPTION:Unionnale\nPresenting Aura by Jason Zante\nIn partnership with the City of Toronto \nYou say ale\, we say alley. Inspired by the streets and alleys of Toronto decked with art\, Unionnale is a space envisioned to animate the south corridor of the Union Market with art by local artists. The space was created as a special art “alley” which provides visual storytelling and interest through a fun and creative artistic moment in the heart of Union Station. As part of Union’s continuing contemporary programming\, the public art in Unionnale will rotate every two years\, with artists chosen through a juried selection process. Unionnale is part of the City of Toronto’s public art initiative. \nAura by Jason Zante \nAura explores the power of biophilic imagery\, its positive effects on the mind and the role of our environment in our daily lives. The ephemeral moments of the seasons are captured through arrangements of lush blooms\, asserting their dominance in the space. Each embodies an aura of coloured emanations in intense hues. The imbued belief of spirited qualities surrounding living things is seen through vibrant expressions. Inspired by neuroaesthetics and the positive physiological responses from nature-derived imagery\, these digital works encourage viewers to pause and have a brief release from the realities and tensions of life. Butterfly milkweed\, blue false indigo\, pale purple cone flowers\, and staghorn sumac line the walls of the space\, with a grand maple tree that towers above the ceiling. Its bark\, composed of a web of intricate and winding patterns\, creates veins of connections. This complex tapestry is a dynamic viewing experience where spectators can find solace and renewal through botanical and natural patterns. It emulates the feeling of walking in a garden\, a park or a forest. In this instance\, staring at an image becomes a vehicle for rejuvenation\, and the installation is a natural sanctuary for wonder and awe. Aura becomes a dialogue between our ecological landscape and mental well-being\, an interconnectedness of our relationship with ourselves and our surroundings. It is not just a visual escape but a return to the environment. \nAbout the Artist \nJason Zante (b. 1998 Aklan\, Philippines) is a Filipino-Canadian artist based in Toronto\, Canada. With a multidisciplinary background\, he creates large-scale mural installations\, paintings\, and digital illustrations. His work embraces escapism\, capturing nature’s essence to depict the liminal space between reality and imagination. Exploring themes of biophilia\, surrealism\, and landscapes\, his works use visual metaphors to personify plants\, shapes\, and symbols in his multilayered narratives. His bold and saturated approach to colour has a transformative effect on both the environment and the viewer. Zante’s creative process involves both digital and traditional methods. He builds his works in layers by adding\, subtracting\, covering\, and revealing using digital tools and acrylic mediums. Zante earned a Bachelor of Design at OCAD University and has created notable site-specific commissions including a mural for The Four Seasons Hotel Toronto (2021) and a 1200-squarefoot mural for Fallsview Casino Resorts in Niagara Falls (2022). Works by the artist are in prestigious and private collections\, including TD Bank of Canada\, CIBC\, Bentallgreenoak\, Cboe Global Markets\, and Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts. His clients include Justin Bieber\, The Globe & Mail\, NBA Canada\, Klick Health\, Deciem\, and the Government of Canada. \nAbout Union \nUnion is committed to reflecting the diversity of Canadians in all our programs and operations. Our programming vision encourages and celebrates creativity\, diversity\, inclusion and accessibility. Our goal is to strengthen the connection between public art and civic engagement ultimately striving to create connectedness amongst our communities. \nAbout the City of Toronto \nThe City of Toronto The City of Toronto’s Public Art Strategy outlines the City’s commitment to public art created for\, and with the input of\, Toronto communities\, and to create opportunities for artists of diverse backgrounds\, experience and practice. The Public Art Strategy recommends opportunities for temporary public art and career-development.

SUMMARY:Union Art : A Kind of Order
DESCRIPTION:A Kind of Order is a free\, publicly accessible art exhibition presented by Union\, sponsored by TD Bank Group (TD)\, and curated in partnership with BAND Gallery. The exhibition is part of Union’s year‑long commitment to promoting and supporting BIPOC creatives\, using public space to amplify Black voices at one of the busiest civic sites in the country. \nFeaturing Timothy Yanick Hunter\, Aaron Jones\, Thato Toeba\, and Hazelle Palmer\, the exhibition explores movement\, migration\, memory\, and becoming through collage\, photography\, installation\, and mixed media. \nA Kind of Order considers transit as more than physical travel\, framing it as an emotional\, intellectual\, and imaginative state shaped by lived experience\, history\, and identity. Installed across multiple locations within Union Toronto\, the exhibition meets audiences mid‑journey\, creating moments of reflection and storytelling. Storytelling and collage act as both method and metaphor\, assembling fragments of personal and collective history into new forms of relation\, belonging\, and possibility. \nWhere is the exhibition located? \nThe exhibition is installed throughout the station\, including: \n\nThe West Wing\nThe Oak Room\nFaçade banners\nUnion Market hoarding walls\n\nOur Artists \nTimothy Yanick Hunter \nTimothy Yanick Hunter uses self-led research and methodologies of recording and sampling to explore the experiential and aesthetic dimensions of the Black diaspora. References culled from a range of sources suggest shifting proximities\, novel interactions between material and provenance. Historical photographs from museum archives meet ephemera from obscure corners of the Internet\, overlaid with shards of music and spoken recordings. The resulting works are living mélanges\, invested in alternative modes of making and thinking about memory\, temporality\, and the unknowable facets of existence. \n \nAaron Jones \nCombining elements of collage\, photography\, and found imagery\, Aaron Jones (b.1993) constructs dreamlike worlds that examine Black identity\, memory\, and transformation. His work reimagines personal and collective histories through a lens of fantasy\, spirituality\, and the everyday\, exploring fragments of life that cannot be captured in real time. Jones began experimenting with collage as a way to escape and feel free from his undergraduate studies at OCAD University\, reassembling meaning from fragments of the familiar—books\, magazines\, family photographs\, and discarded materials. This practice evolved into a meditation on the irreparable and the imaginative\, merging the mystical with the mundane. Jones’s work considers the tensions between the real and the fantastical\, the visible and the invisible. By constructing hybrid figures and landscapes\, he offers poetic counter-narratives to dominant visual histories of Blackness—ones that prioritize renewal\, play\, and inner life over representation and spectacle. \n \nThato Toeba \nThato Toeba was born in 1990 in Maseru\, and lives in Amsterdam. They completed a two-year residency at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam in 2025\, and received an LLM from Humboldt University\, Berlin in 2015.\nToeba’s first solo exhibition with the gallery\, Phate lia Lekana\, took place in Johannesburg in 2023\, followed by sehlahla se tukang empa se sa che in Cape Town in 2025. The artist is included in I Still Dream of Lost Vocabularies at Autograph\, London (October 2025) and Manifestation #52: To Be Determined\, Buro Stedelijk\, Amsterdam (August 2025). Past group exhibitions include Tools for Conviviality\, Kunstinstituut Melly\, Rotterdam (2024); Today I wish to talk to your dreams\, Mount Nelson\, Cape Town (2023); Where do I begin\, Stevenson\, Cape Town (2022); and Propelling Otherness\, Morija Museum\, Maseru (2021) Toeba was awarded the 2025 FNB Art Prize\, which is accompanied by a solo exhibition at the Johannesburg Art Gallery in 2026. \n \nHazelle Palmer \nHazelle Palmer is a Toronto based artist whose work embodies the diversity of her lived experiences. Hazelle has been an artist for over 30 years and holds a Bachelor of Arts in Communications. Her work has appeared on the covers of publications including “Tales from the Gardens and Beyond” and “Eyeing the North Star”. Her work is held in numerous private collections. \nHazelle Palmer is drawn to a dynamic palette of rich\, rustic tones that evoke the colours and memories of her childhood experiences and celebrate the tropical hues often associated with her Caribbean heritage. Fascinated by the ways in which she can add depth to her work\, she explores how colour is used to define identity and how the use of texture\, paper and patterns bring those identities to life and capture moments defined by her experiences. Her work is always evolving from the abstract to collage to figurative depictions but central is an element of perfect imperfection – often visible in how she blends colour\, layers paper in collages\, or the sometimes-awkward positions of the figures in her work to suggest the challenges we all face fitting in.
