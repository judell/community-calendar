SUMMARY:A Fire Upon the Deep - Vernor Vinge
DESCRIPTION:The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone\,\n\nWidely regarded among s
 cience fiction readers and critics as one of the standout space opera nove
 ls of its era\, *A Fire Upon the Deep* has been on my radar for a while bu
 t hasn't made it to our survey. I was glad to see it immediately selected 
 by membership. It's especially touted in hard sci-fi circles\, so it will 
 be a good follow-up after a more fantasy-leaning novel in *Black Sun*.\n\n
 Book of the Month\n*A Fire Upon the Deep -* Vernor Vinge (1992)\n\nMuch of
  *A Fire Upon the Deep*'s reputation comes from its innovative worldbuildi
 ng and unique alien culture. Vinge is generally praised for his writing ch
 ops and being able to balance the concept and the details. As reported in 
 this interesting [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2022/11/geeks-guide
 -fire-upon-the-deep/)\, the novel "...juggles dozens of characters and plo
 tlines without ever becoming confusing. Science fiction author Abby Goldsm
 ith [says] '...plotwise it’s stunning...the work shows. The amount of ti
 me and effort he put into thinking it through\, I really admire that.'" Al
 l this said\, I've heard that it can be a slow start for some readers and 
 a hill to climb at the beginning. But once it gets going\, it's hard to pu
 t down. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this one!\n\nTo join a
  Book Club meeting\, all you will need is YOURSELF. If you haven’t had a
  chance to finish the book\, we still would love for you to join us in the
  discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for events? [The Sci Fi Book
  Club is on Discord](https://discord.gg/B9NMnC2F). Join us and keep the co
 nversation going.

SUMMARY:"Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy 2025" Editor: John Joseph
  Adams
DESCRIPTION:The Sci Fi Book Club\nBook of the Month:\n“The Best American
  Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025”\nEditors: John Joseph Adams\, Nnedi O
 korafor\n\nThis month we are keeping a beloved Sci Fi Book Club tradition 
 alive. For the eleventh year in a row (wow\, still can't believe that's ri
 ght)\, we will be reading the newest edition of a short story collection c
 alled *The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy*. It has been a Club 
 favorite each year and takes a look at the current state of science fictio
 n by highlighting some new and established writers in the genre. Each stor
 y has to meet certain criteria that you can read up on at the editor’s w
 ebsite\, and is chosen without the author’s name attached.\n\nStories ar
 e selected by John Joseph Adams and this year's guest editor\, Nnedi Okora
 for. Okorafor has appeared in this collection before and is best known for
  novels like *Who Fears Death*\, *Binti*\, *and* Lagoon (a Book Club selec
 tion back in 2018). She is celebrated for imaginative storytelling that is
  deeply rooted in African cultures\, myths\, and histories. Her work often
  blends Africanfuturism with speculative fiction\, highlighting marginaliz
 ed perspectives and exploring futures where myth and science coexist.\n\nI
 t's always interesting to see what themes and premonitions make their way 
 into the writing zeitgeist in a given year. From [Adams' website](https://
 www.johnjosephadams.com/projects/best-american-science-fiction-and-fantasy
 -2025/) "The twenty stories in this collection simultaneously fulfill and 
 defy expectations of genre\, showcasing boundary-pushing authors at their 
 best..From the joyous\, to the terrifying\, to the heart-wrenching and the
  absurd\, these stories encourage you to open your mind and\, as Okorafor 
 promises\, 'Watch your world expand.'"\n\nPer usual\, I recommend coming b
 ack around to the Introduction by Okorafor once you've read the stories\, 
 as it sometimes contains spoilers. The Preface is worth it\, for sure! It 
 describes the selection process.\n\nLet us know in the Comments below whic
 h stories you like\, and feel free to skip one if you’re not digging it.
  There are always plenty of perspectives and approaches to the format in t
 his collection.\n\n*The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025* is
  available in paperback and audiobook via Amazon and other online booksell
 ers\, and is also available via the New York Public Library.\n\nTo join a 
 Book Club meeting\, all you will need is YOURSELF! If you haven’t had a 
 chance to finish the book\, we still would love for you to join us in the 
 discussion.

SUMMARY:Her Smoke Rose Up Forever - James Tiptree Jr.
DESCRIPTION:The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi all\,\n\nFor May\, we will be reading
  another short story collection. Following April’s selection\, *Best Ame
 rican Science Fiction and Fantasy 2025*\, we’ll turn to an older antholo
 gy. This collection features stories by a science fiction writer who remai
 ned cloaked in mystery for years.\n\nBook of the Month\n*Her Smoke Rose Up
  Forever* \\- James Tiptree Jr\\. \\(1990\\)\n\nDirect from [this amazing 
 Portalist](https://theportalist.com/james-tiptree-jr-enigmatic-author) art
 icle:\n"James Tiptree Jr. left an enduring mark on modern speculative fict
 ion — but she’s perhaps more mysterious and enigmatic today than ever 
 before.\n\nTiptree was one of the pen names used by female sci-fi author A
 lice Bradley Sheldon (née Alice Hastings Bradley). The daughter of prolif
 ic fiction writer Mary Hastings Bradley\, Sheldon may have been born with 
 the gift of words\, but her path to literary success wasn’t clear-cut.\n
 \nAlthough Sheldon is best known for her sci-fi writing\, she had an eclec
 tic and accomplished career. At various times in her life\, Sheldon was a 
 research psychologist\, painter\, art critic\, imagery intelligence operat
 ive\, CIA operative\, and more. In many of these fields\, she was one of t
 he few women in an industry dominated by men. "\n\nGiven this and Tiptree'
 s well-known stories included in this collection\, I don't think we can pa
 ss up this opportunity. As with any other collection we read for Book Club
 \, if a story isn't speaking to you\, go ahead and skip it! There are 18 s
 elections in here\, I'm sure we'll have plenty to discuss.\n\nBelow\, you'
 ll find a few notables and a brief description:\n\n* “The Women Men Don
 ’t See” – A classic feminist sci-fi story exploring gender\, invisib
 ility\, and societal expectations.\n* “Houston\, Houston\, Do You Read?
 ” – A Hugo Award–winning story about time travel\, gender\, and post
 -apocalyptic society.\n* “Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death” – A hi
 ghly acclaimed story told from the perspective of an alien species\, explo
 ring instinct\, love\, and survival.\n* “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” 
 – A groundbreaking cyberpunk-like story about identity\, media\, and cor
 porate control of bodies.\n* “And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold 
 Hill’s Side” – A dark\, unsettling exploration of obsession and desi
 re for alien contact.\n\nThere are a few printings of this collections. I 
 think [I'm going to pick up this one](https://bookshop.org/p/books/her-smo
 ke-rose-up-forever-james-tiptree/163a6a04d0124023?ean=9781892391209&next=t

SUMMARY:Station Eleven - Emily St. John Mandel
DESCRIPTION:The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone\,\n\nOur novel for June came
  in at a close second for contemporary picks on our survey. The story take
 s place around a devastating flu pandemic that threatens society as we kno
 w it. It's often cited as one of the more prophetic novels of recent times
 \, but takes things well beyond the covid pandemic.\n\nBook of the Month\n
 *Station Eleven -* Emily St. John Mandel (2014)\n\nFrom [Grimdark Magazine
 ](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-
 mandel/)\, "*Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel takes the best parts
  of the dystopian science fiction and fantasy genre and does one thing mos
 t books can’t\, give the reader hope." I really like the way [A Little B
 ook Problem](https://alittlebookproblem.co.uk/2023/08/04/book-review-stati

 0book%20is%20a%20beautiful%2C\,to%20in%20a%20world%20when)'s review descri
 bes the tone. "The book is a beautiful\, heart-wrenching and moving explor
 ation of what is important to us in life\, what we would hang on to in a w
 orld when almost everything we know and care about is torn away\, and what
  kind of people we discover we are in the face of great adversity."\n\n*St
 ation Eleven* shows how science fiction isn’t just about the future. It
 ’s about how we live today\, and the threads that connect us all. It's a
  celebration of the arts and bound to be a great conversation. I look forw
 ard to discussing this one with you!\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting\, all

SUMMARY:I Who Have Never Known Men - Jacqueline Harpman
DESCRIPTION:The Sci Fi Book Club\nHi everyone\,\n\nOur selection for July 
 is short but mighty story\, and I'm here for it. It has been rediscovered 
 recently on BookTok and is being compared to books like Margaret Atwood’
 s *A Handmaid's Tale* and Octavia E Butler’s *Parable* series. Translate
 d from French and published in 1995 then slipped into relative obscurity. 
 The themes are intense but I'm told that the storytelling and the message 
 are well worth it. If you're interested in learning more about the book's 
 resurgence\, check out this great [Guardian article](https://www.theguardi
 an.com/books/2025/feb/01/i-who-have-never-known-men-lost-dystopia-new-read
 ers-after-buzz-on-tiktok).\n\nBook of the Month\n*I Who Have Never Known M
 en* \\- Jacqueline Harpman \\(1995\\)\n\nFrom Goodreads\, *I Who Have Neve
 r Known Men* is a story about a group of women imprisoned and guarded. The
  women have no memory of how they got there\, no notion of time\, and only
  a vague recollection of their lives before. What comes next is a story of
  a young woman's fight to uncover her past and make her own future. People
  are divided on the story's finer points\, but just about everyone I've re
 ad has echoed [What Is Quinn Reading](https://www.whatisquinnreading.com/r
 eviews/i-who-have-never-known-men-book-review)'s review\, saying they're g
 rateful for the read and will carry it with them. At approximately 190 pag
 es\, I'm glad you'all feel that we should dive in and investigate this kin
 d of story.\n\nTo join a Book Club meeting\, all you will need is YOURSELF
 . If you haven’t had a chance to finish the book\, we still would love f
 or you to join us in the discussion.\n\nNot able to join us in person for
