SUMMARY:Enterprise‑Grade DevOps for Microsoft Fabric
DESCRIPTION:Toronto Enterprise DevOps User Group\nModern Microsoft Fabric 
 projects often start with built‑in Git integration and deployment pipeli
 nes—but at enterprise scale\, those capabilities alone are rarely suffic
 ient. As environments grow in size and complexity teams need more advanced
  tools and patterns to manage Fabric artifacts reliably across development
 \, test\, and production.\n\nIn this session\, we will:\n\\- Review common
  enterprise lifecycle challenges in Microsoft Fabric\n\\- Introduce advanc
 ed DevOps tooling and automation patterns used to address them\n\\- Walk t
 hrough a realistic implementation pattern that shows how these tools fit t
 ogether in practice\n\nThis session is designed for data and platform engi
 neers and architects responsible for operating Microsoft Fabric in product
 ion. If you’re already using Git integration and deployment pipelines an
 d are looking to extend them with more scalable\, repeatable\, and enterpr
 ise‑ready CI/CD practices\, this session will help you understand when a
 nd how to go beyond the defaults.\n\n*Come at 5:30 pm have some pizza and 
 chat for a bit. The presentation starts at 6:00 pm.*
