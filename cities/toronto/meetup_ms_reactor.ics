SUMMARY:Prompt Engineering with LangChain4j
DESCRIPTION:Microsoft Reactor Toronto\nThe same AI gives wildly different 
 results based on how you ask. Master eight prompting patterns that control
  GPT-5's reasoning depth\, from quick calculations to deep architectural a
 nalysis. Learn to write self-reflecting prompts that iterate until code me
 ets quality criteria\, structured analysis frameworks for consistent revie
 ws\, and chain-of-thought techniques that reveal the AI's reasoning proces
 s.\n\nPre-requisites:\nCheck out the LangChain4j beginners series: https:/

SUMMARY:VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day
DESCRIPTION:Microsoft Reactor Toronto\nJoin us for VS Code Live: Agent Ses
 sions Day on Feb 19th: a global virtual event celebrating how Visual Studi
 o Code continues to evolve as the world’s most loved editor\, now redefi
 ned with AI. Join the product team for live demos showing how VS Code enab
 les agentic development while staying true to its core values: open\, exte
 nsible\, and deeply community‑driven. See how developers are using agent
 s\, customizable workflows\, and open integrations to build smarter.\n\n| 
 Session | Description | Speaker(s) |\n| :------------------- |:-----------
 ----------- | :------------------- |\n| Welcome & Agent HQ Vision | Welcom
 e to VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day! | Kyle Daigle |\n| Keynote | VS Cod
 e has evolved into the unified home for multi-agent development—where de
 velopers delegate\, orchestrate\, and collaborate with AI agents across lo
 cal\, background\, and cloud environments. This keynote demo will showcase
  how the latest updates make working with multiple agents seamless\, power
 ful\, and secure. | Harald Kirschner |\n| How VS Code Builds with AI | The
  VS Code team uses agents every day to build and improve the editor. Hear 
 firsthand how we integrate AI into our development workflow\, what we've l
 earned about working alongside agents\, and how feedback from our own usag
 e shapes the features you use today. | Pierce Boggan\, Peng Lyu |\n| A Uni
 fied Agent Experience | VS Code has become the unified interface for all y
 our coding agents. Learn how to manage local\, background\, and cloud agen
 t sessions from a single view. We'll dive into cloud agents—including Cl
 aude and Codex—and show how to delegate tasks to remote infrastructure\,
  collaborate with your team through PRs\, and leverage partner agents unde
 r your GitHub Copilot subscription. | Josh Spicer |\n| Extend Agents with 
 MCP | MCP Apps let tool calls return interactive UI components that render
  directly in chat—dashboards\, forms\, visualizations\, and multi-step w
 orkflows. Discover how this first official MCP extension creates richer hu
 man-agent collaboration. We'll also cover the latest MCP updates in VS Cod
 e. | Connor Peet |\n| The Browser in your Editor | The new integrated brow
 ser lets you preview and inspect sites directly inside VS Code—complete 
 with DevTools\, authentication support\, and the ability to select page el
 ements as AI chat context. See how it streamlines your inner dev loop and 
 enables agents to work more effectively with web applications. | Joaquin R
 uales\, Justin Chen\, Kyle Cutler |\n| Bring your own model in VS Code | V
 S Code supports using your own API keys and custom model providers alongsi
 de GitHub Copilot. Learn how to configure BYOK models and how local agents
  can leverage models from other providers to empower developer choice. | S
 andeeep Somavarapu |\n| How we ship models | Shipping the right AI model f
 or each task requires a lot of testing and evaluation. Get an inside look 
 at how the VS Code and Copilot teams assess model quality\, decide when to
  roll out updates\, and balance capability with reliability. | Julia Kaspe
 r |\n| Customize your agents | Turn GitHub Copilot in VS Code into a speci
 alized AI teammate with custom agents\, Agent Skills\, and MCP integration
 s. We'll show you how to build agents for specific roles and wire them tog
 ether with handoffs to create guided workflows. Walk away with practical p
 atterns for making Copilot work the way your team works. | Courtney Webste
 r |\n| Copilot CLI in VS Code | The Copilot CLI brings powerful AI assista
 nce directly to your terminal. And now\, VS Code connects seamlessly with 
 the CLI—track sessions\, view progress\, and switch between terminal and
  editor without losing context. See how the two work together to give you 
 Copilot wherever you prefer to code. | Alex Weininger |\n| Best Practices 
 for Agentic Coding | After live coding an app all through the event\, Burk
 e and Pierce will share their tips and best practices for how you can get 
 started with the power of multi-agent development in VS Code. | Burke Holl
 and\, Pierce Boggan |\n| Closing Message | Thank you for joining us for VS

SUMMARY:Building RAG‑Powered Intelligent Apps with SQL
DESCRIPTION:Microsoft Reactor Toronto\n**Welcome to the SQL + AI Datathon!
 **\n\nIn this session\, we prepare you to complete the final Datathon miss
 ions. We bring everything together starting from notebooks to a working ap
 plication. You’ll orchestrate SQL + AI workflows using notebooks and age
 nt-style patterns\, then turn those workflows into a full-stack applicatio
 n with SQL Server 2025.\n\nWe’ll cover how to treat SQL queries as retri
 eval tools\, wire them into RAG-based workflows\, and expose SQL data thro
 ugh APIs using Data API Builder (DAB).\n\nBy the end\, you’ll understand
  how embeddings\, RAG\, and SQL-powered APIs fit together to support a sma

SUMMARY:Python + Agents: Building your first agent in Python
DESCRIPTION:Microsoft Reactor Toronto\nIn the first session of our Python 
 + Agents series\, we’ll kick things off with the fundamentals: what AI a
 gents are\, how they work\, and how to build your first one using the Micr
 osoft Agent Framework.\n\nWe’ll start with the core anatomy of an agent\
 , then walk through how tool calling works in practice—beginning with a 
 single tool\, expanding to multiple tools\, and finally connecting to tool
 s exposed through local MCP servers.\n\nWe’ll conclude with the supervis
 or agent pattern\, where a single supervisor agent coordinates subtasks ac
 ross multiple subagents\, by treating each agent as a tool.\n\nAlong the w
 ay\, we'll share tips for debugging and inspecting agents\, like using the
  DevUI interface from Microsoft Agent Framework for interacting with agent
  prototypes.\n\n**Prerequisites**: To follow along with the live examples\
 , sign up for a free GitHub account. If you are brand new to generative AI
  with Python\, start with our [9-part Python + AI series](https://aka.ms/p
 ythonai/rewatch)\, which covers LLMs\, embedding models\, RAG\, tool calli
 ng\, MCP\, and more.\n\nPre-requisites:\nTo follow along with the live exa
