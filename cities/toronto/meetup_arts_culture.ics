SUMMARY:Hot Docs:  Exhibition on Screen--Turner & Constable   ($10-$15)
DESCRIPTION:TORONTO ARTS & CULTURE\nThis is a brand new **2026 release** f
 rom the folks behind 'Exhibition on Screen'\n\n**Ticket link is below.** $
 10-$15 per ticket\n\nIt coincides with this ART exhibition at **TATE** Lon
 don. On NOW.\n\nhttps://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/turner-and-c
 onstable\n\nCan't make it to London/UK--let 'Exhibition on Screen' bring i
 t to you!\n\n(These DOCS are so very well done--perhaps this is our 5th 'A
 RT' tour)\n\n***Two of Britain’s greatest painters\, J.M.W. Turner and J
 ohn Constable were also the greatest of rivals.*** Born within a year of e
 ach other\, both used landscape painting to reflect the changing world aro
 und them.\n\n\\*\\*Tate Britain is bringing these two greats together for 
 a groundbreaking exhibition in London from November 2025 to April 2026.\n\
 n***Exhibition on Screen*** once again has exclusive and privileged access
  to bring their extraordinary art and remarkable stories to the big screen
 . Discover unexpected sides to both artists with intimate views of sketchb
 ooks and personal items and insights from leading experts.\n\n**Turner’s
  blazing sunsets** and sublime scenes from his travels and **Constable’s
  idealised depictions of beloved places** from home whipped the public of 
 the time into a frenzy of enthusiasm. Constable represents the very best o
 f the old school of realism and pastoral nostalgia\; Turner\, an exciting 
 new way of depicting emotion and dreamlike impressions. Critics compared t
 heir starkly different styles to a clash of "fire and water." Don't miss t
 his opportunity to see these greats side-by-side\, as they so often were i
 n life\, on the big screen for the first time.\n\nConstable-\n\nhttps://ww

 nce and other costs you will incur. In the past\, members have travelled e
 ither by air\, VIA\, drive\, Bus. They have stayed in hotels (points)\, Ai
 rbnb\, Bed & Breakfast\, Hostel\, or with friends.\n\nBy planning ahead\, 
 you can get the best rates etc. VIA and accommodations.\n\nThere is no "wr

 ins **walk** from St. Catherine St/Place des Arts.\n\n3\\. These are full 
 trips\\\, with very little "free\\-time"\\. We are on the go\\.\n4\\. On t
