SUMMARY:Hot Docs:  Exhibition on Screen--Turner & Constable   ($10-$15)
DESCRIPTION:TORONTO ARTS & CULTURE\nThis is a brand new **2026 release** f
 rom the folks behind 'Exhibition on Screen'\n\n**Ticket link is below.** $
 10-$15 per ticket\n\nIt coincides with this ART exhibition at **TATE** Lon
 don. On NOW.\n\nhttps://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/turner-and-c
 onstable\n\nCan't make it to London/UK--let 'Exhibition on Screen' bring i
 t to you!\n\n(These DOCS are so very well done--perhaps this is our 5th 'A
 RT' tour)\n\n***Two of Britain’s greatest painters\, J.M.W. Turner and J
 ohn Constable were also the greatest of rivals.*** Born within a year of e
 ach other\, both used landscape painting to reflect the changing world aro
 und them.\n\n\\*\\*Tate Britain is bringing these two greats together for 
 a groundbreaking exhibition in London from November 2025 to April 2026.\n\
 n***Exhibition on Screen*** once again has exclusive and privileged access
  to bring their extraordinary art and remarkable stories to the big screen
 . Discover unexpected sides to both artists with intimate views of sketchb
 ooks and personal items and insights from leading experts.\n\n**Turner’s
  blazing sunsets** and sublime scenes from his travels and **Constable’s
  idealised depictions of beloved places** from home whipped the public of 
 the time into a frenzy of enthusiasm. Constable represents the very best o
 f the old school of realism and pastoral nostalgia\; Turner\, an exciting 
 new way of depicting emotion and dreamlike impressions. Critics compared t
 heir starkly different styles to a clash of "fire and water." Don't miss t
 his opportunity to see these greats side-by-side\, as they so often were i
 n life\, on the big screen for the first time.\n\nConstable-\n\nhttps://ww

  a rigorous selection of galleries presenting thoughtfully chosen artists 
 and artworks\; and through accessible programming that addresses current i
 ssues and questions in the field of art.\n\n**Plural's 19th edition** will
  be held from April 10-12th at the Port of Montreal’s Grand Quay. (Old M
 ontreal). Just a fabulous space/btw. Old warehouse.\n\nIf you are familiar

 \, all day Friday and Saturday. You return home on Sunday at your own time
 .\n2. **You are** responsible for your own travel\, accommodation\, insura
 nce and other costs you will incur. In the past\, members have travelled e
 ither by air\, VIA\, drive\, Bus. They have stayed in hotels (points)\, Ai
 rbnb\, Bed & Breakfast\, Hostel\, or with friends.\n\nBy planning ahead\, 
 you can get the best rates etc. VIA and accommodations.\n\nThere is no "wr
 ong" place to stay in Montreal\, but ideally you want to be about 1km/20 m
 ins **walk** from St. Catherine St/Place des Arts.\n\n3\\. These are full 
 trips\\\, with very little "free\\-time"\\. We are on the go\\.\n4\\. On t

 25\\-$150 per person range\\. This is the only formal meal event I organiz
 e\\\, although other meals fall into place while there\\.\n5\\. You would 
 need to be in Montreal and ready to go by about 6pm on Wednesday April 8th

 ery rewarding\\! Much of what we do while there is FREE\\.\n\nAny question
