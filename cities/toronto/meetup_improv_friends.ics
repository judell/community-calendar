SUMMARY:Improv Class for New Friends
DESCRIPTION:Improv For New Friends\nDon't be disappointed if you don't see
  a bunch of people attending. I advertise this on multiple platforms and t
 he class usually sells out.\n\n\\*\\*If you don't use Paypal\, email me at
  ralph@socap.ca and we'll figure it out. You can pay be etransfer or with 
 a credit card/cash at the venue.\\*\\*\n\nImprov comedy uses several techn
 iques to create laughter. These include\, creating an atmosphere free of j
 udgement\, saying 'yes'\, active listening\, being positive\, putting your
  focus on others\, and the importance of play and laughter.\n\nNot coincid
 entally\, these are the same things that happen to us naturally when we ar
 e bonding with another person.\n\nIn this class\, we'll explore these tech
 niques not with the goal of being funny\, but with the goal of being peopl
 e that other people want to be around.\n\nThe teacher\, Ralph MacLeod\, is
  a co-founder of two independent improv clubs in Toronto - Bad Dog Theatre
  and Social Capital Theatre. He's been teaching improv for over 30 years. 
 He also teaches these same techniques to several organizations including U
 ofT\, Google\, Kraft\, Shopify and many\, many more.\n\nPlease feel free t
 o ask any questions you may have!\n\nFAQs and Good To Know....\n\nAfter ev
 ery event\, a group from this class sit down and have a drink together so 
 be prepared to stay if you want! Of course\, you don't HAVE to.\n\nYou als
 o don't have to be single or bring a friend. The vibe of this class is muc
 h more 'making new friends' than a 'singles' mixer'.\n\nWe usually run to 
 8:15 so pay for extra parking!
