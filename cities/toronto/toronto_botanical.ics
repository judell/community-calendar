SUMMARY:Milkweed Meadow: Needle Felting & Embroidery 2-Day Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Join us for this beginner-friendly 2-day workshop and learn needle felting & embroidery techniques!\n\n\nDiscover the beauty and ecological importance of milkweed through fiber art at the Toronto Botanical Gardens! In this immersive two-day workshop\, you’ll create a textile artwork inspired by actual milkweed herbarium specimens—plants that are essential to monarch butterflies and countless other pollinators. \nWorking with a soft palette of greens\, browns\, warm pinks\, and purples on creamy white felt\, you’ll learn two complementary textile techniques: needle felting (which allows you to “paint” with wool) and hand embroidery (which adds intricate detail and texture). No prior drawing or embroidery experience is necessary. \nMilkweed is one of nature’s most remarkable plants\, playing a critical role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining fragile ecosystems. For monarch butterflies\, milkweed is literally a matter of survival—it is the only plant on which they can lay their eggs\, and milkweed leaves are the sole food source for their caterpillars. The plant’s leaves also provide monarchs with chemical defenses against predators\, while its nectar-rich flowers fuel the adults’ incredible multi-generational migrations across thousands of miles. \nBeyond monarchs\, milkweed is a keystone species that supports an entire web of life. Its flowers provide essential nectar for bees\, wasps\, flies\, and hummingbirds\, while its distinctive seed pods offer nourishment for birds. \nBy creating art inspired by milkweed\, we celebrate this extraordinary plant and reflect on ecosystems and interconnection. \nDay One: Needle Felting Foundations \n\nIntroduction to milkweed ecology and examination of herbarium specimens\nObservational drawing: tracing and adapting milkweed forms to create your unique composition\nTransferring your drawing onto felt backing\nNeedle felting techniques: learning to “paint” with wool roving\nBuilding up layers of color and creating shading effects\nDeveloping leaves\, stems\, seed pods\, and flowers using our nature-inspired color palette\n\nDay Two: Embroidery Details \n\nReview of Day One work and troubleshooting\nIntroduction to hand embroidery stitches for adding definition and detail\nStitching techniques for different elements: veining in leaves\, texture in seed pods\, delicate flower details\nCombining needle felting and embroidery for dimensional effects\nFinishing techniques and backing options\nCare instructions and ideas for continuing your practice at home\n\nWhat You’ll Learn \n\nHow to translate natural forms into fiber art through observational drawing and tracing\nNeedle felting fundamentals: choosing needles\, controlling wool placement\, creating gradients and shading\nEssential embroidery stitches for botanical details\nColor theory and blending techniques specific to wool\nHow to combine two textile techniques for rich\, layered results\nStrategies for creating depth\, dimension\, and naturalistic effects\n\nAll materials are provided\, and you’ll take home supplies to continue your creative practice. Optional items to bring: \n\nComfortable clothing (small wool fibers may cling to fabric)\nAn apron or smock if desired\nA camera or phone to photograph the herbarium specimens (optional—printed reference images will be provided)\n\nSchedule: Sunday\, March 15 and 22 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. There will be a one-hour break for lunch. We recommend bringing a lunch as there are limited options nearby. \nRegistration: Public $145\, Members $125 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \n \nAbout Amanda McCavour\nAmanda McCavour is a Canadian artist who works with stitch to create large-scale embroidered installations. \nHer immersive installations speak to themes of memory\, environment\, colour and line. She is interested in finding connections between scientific research and decorative patterns found in textiles and wallpaper. Her lace-like pieces are made by sewing into fabric that dissolves in water. When the fabric is dissolved\, the thread drawings interlock together even without a base. Plants and their ecologies are similarly linked—a biological network is a bound system that sustains a community of plants. \nMcCavour holds a BFA from York University and an MFA in Fibers and Material Studies from Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. McCavour shows her work in galleries nationally and internationally and has completed residencies at Harbourfront Centre’s Textile Studio in Toronto\, and the Klondike Institute of Art and Culture in Dawson City\, Yukon.
