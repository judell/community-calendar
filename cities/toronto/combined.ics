Please register on our website before coming to High Park. We cannot guarantee availability of walk-in spots. If an event is at capacity\, please put yourself on our waitlist.

SUMMARY:Theatre Passe Muraille:  Through the Eyes of God  (World Premiere)
DESCRIPTION:TORONTO ARTS & CULTURE\n{ SOLD-OUT }\n\n*“A searing tale of 
 a Mother’s devotion\, defiance\, and survival.”*\n\nTwo decades after 
 **Anusree Roy** wrote her hit play *Pyaasa*\, she returns to **Theatre Pas
 se Muraille** with a powerful sequel — *Through the Eyes of God*.\n\nTic
 kets are **$40 each**. *Reserve your own* at the link below. Venue only ha
 s 40 seats!!\n\nChaya\, the protagonist at the centre of the original play
 \, is now a spirited young woman and mother\, who is arrested for the desp
 erate act of stealing rice to feed her young daughter. But soon she faces 
 a far greater horror: her child\, Krishna\, has been trafficked to Delhi. 
 Driven by primal love\, she embarks on a gut-wrenching journey through the
  underbelly of a broken system\, where every lead is a gamble and every ch
 oice is impossible. ***Through the Eyes of God*** is a piercingly emotiona
 l and sharply critical journey that asks: How far will a mother go to prot
 ect her child?\n\nA reminder on who **Anusree Roy** is:\n\nhttps://en.wiki
 pedia.org/wiki/Anusree_Roy\n\n**Ticket link here: (for Sunday February 15t
 h @ 2pm)**\n\nhttps://www.passemuraille.ca/through-the-eyes-of-god/\n\nNOT
 E: this performance is taking place in the new smaller/intimate 'Back Spac
 e" at Theatre Passe Muraille.\n\n*Theatre Passe Muraille* is Canada's alte
 rnative theatre company for Independent and experimental theatrical work s
 ince 1968.\n\nAlso--this Play has just been recommended as 'Not to be miss
 ed' by a local theatre reviewer!\n\n**Seating for 40 people only!** Plan a
 head. Don't delay.\n\nI found this review from 2008--**PYAASA** (her origi
 nal play about the outlawed caste system)\n\nhttps://www.stage-door.com/Th

SUMMARY:❄️ Winter Ravines Walk: Finch West to Downsview Park ❄️
DESCRIPTION:Try New Things in Toronto!\n**❄️ Winter Ravines Walk: Finc
 h West to Downsview Park ❄️**\n\nIf winter has been making you want to
  hibernate\, this is your sign to bundle up\, step outside\, and do someth
 ing that feels genuinely good for the soul. This winter walk is all about 
 fresh air\, movement\, conversation\, and discovering just how much green 
 space is quietly tucked into the city — even in the colder months.\n\nWe
 ’ll start at **Finch West Subway Station** and head out together along t
 he **Finch Corridor Trail**\, an unexpectedly peaceful stretch that eases 
 you into the walk. From there\, we’ll move through **Derrydowns Park** a
 nd **Downsview Dells Park**\, where winter turns the ravines into a calm\,
  almost meditative landscape — snow-dusted paths\, bare trees\, and that
  crisp\, quiet feeling you only get this time of year.\n\nThis isn’t a p
 ower walk and it’s not a hike that leaves you gasping for air. It’s an
  **easy-to-moderate winter stroll**\, paced so people can chat\, get to kn
 ow one another\, and actually enjoy where they are. These walks have a way
  of breaking down walls — conversations flow more easily when you’re w
 alking side by side\, and by the time we reach the end\, strangers often f
 eel like familiar faces.\nWe’ll finish our journey at **Downsview Park**
 \, wrapping up at\n\n**Downsview Park Subway Station**\, feeling refreshed
 \, accomplished\, and very glad we didn’t stay inside.\n\n📱 **Don’t

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion\, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum

SUMMARY:ABCD Reads "Heart the Lover" by Lily King
DESCRIPTION:A Book Club\, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads "**Heart the Lover**
 " by Lily King.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/6289524441481216
 ) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n"For its first 
 half...a wry\, witty\, exquisitely evocative campus tale\, a fevered ficti
 on of a youthful love triangle\, and a reflection\,...on the growth and de
 velopment of a writer. By the end\, it stands as one of the most emotional
 ly devastating and soulfully wise novels I have ever read ... Literary wit
 hout pretension\, emotional without maudlin sentimentality. It must be sai
 d\, however\, that King skirts perilously close to the latter in Part 3\, 
 and it is a tribute to the power of her moral vision\, the precision of he
 r prose\, and her animating empathy that the novel avoids bathos and pulls
  off these wild swerves convincingly ... Heartrending\, swoonily romantic\
 , rigorously clear-sighted." (from [The Boston Globe](https://www.bostongl
 obe.com/2025/09/23/arts/lily-king-heart-the-lover/))\n\n"Our narrator unde
 rstands good love stories—their secrets and subtext\, their highs and th
 eir free falls. But her greatest love story\, the one she lived\, never fo
 llowed the simple rules.\nIn the fall of her senior year of college\, she 
 meets two star students from her 17th-Century Lit class: Sam and Yash. Bes
 t friends living off-campus in the elegant house of a professor on sabbati
 cal\, the boys invite her into their intoxicating world of academic fervor
 \, rapid-fire banter and raucous card games. They nickname her Jordan\, an
 d she quickly discovers the pleasures of friendship\, love and her own int
 ellectual ambition. Youthful passion is unpredictable though\, and she soo
 n finds herself at the center of a charged and intricate triangle. As grad
 uation comes and goes\, choices made will alter these three lives forever.
 \nDecades later\, Jordan is living the life she dreamed of\, and the vulne
 rable days of her youth seem comfortably behind her. But when a surprise v
 isit and unexpected news brings the past crashing into the present\, Jorda
 n returns to a world she left behind and is forced to confront the decisio
 ns and deceptions of her younger self.\nWritten with the superb wit and em
 otional sensitivity fans and critics of Lily King have come to adore\, *He
 art the Lover* is a deeply moving story that celebrates love\, friendship\
 , and the transformative nature of forgiveness. Wise\, unforgettable\, and
  with a delightful connective thread to *Writers & Lovers*\, this is King 
 at her very best\, affirming her as a masterful chronicler of the human ex
 perience and one of the finest novelists at work today." (from [Goodreads]
 (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228110489-heart-the-lover))\n\n**:: A
 BOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event
  and stay 30 minutes or longer afterward to connect with other attendees o
 utside the book talk.\n\nPlease ensure you have read the book before atten
 ding (though finishing any book is not a barrier to participating\, as lon
 g as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. 
 If the event is full\, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Mi
 chael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more
  information\, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regula
 r attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT
  BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each event\, we will ask for nominees for our ne
 xt book. If you have a good one in mind\, please ensure it is between 200-
 400 pages long\, available from the Toronto Public Library\, and counts as
  contemporary literary fiction (though these are not hard and fast rules).
  When enough nominees are collected\, Michael will send the members a dire
 ct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown

SUMMARY: bentway after school - for curious and creative community explor
 ers\, ages 9-14
DESCRIPTION:If you're looking for a creative\, after-school\, winter prog
 ram in downtown Toronto\, check out the "Bentway after school".\n\nThe Be
 ntway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with 
 lots of fun\, creativity\, and outdoor discovery along the way. The progr
 am empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban de
 sign\, city building\, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigatio
 ns\, storytelling\, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session optio
 ns\, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or
  both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  *
  The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will
  be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and 
 February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic\, figure-8 skate
  trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is
  held across The Bentway sites\, including indoor and outdoor activities 
 and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the ele
 ments and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender
  washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut
 -sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff\, p
 lease do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts\, nuts and al
 l other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent follo
 wing online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” 
 — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session\, young urbanists will 
 ask questions\, gather information\, compare and collaborate\, draw concl
 usions\, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\
 nInteractive experiences including site tours\, outdoor recreation\, and 
 hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth ed
 ucation leaders Maximum City\, will encourage participants to not only ex
 plore The Bentway\, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s hist
 ory\, current state\, and potential future through skill building in mult
 idisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping
 \, ecology\, storytelling\, adaptation\, and youth agency\, the program e
 mpowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can becom
 e when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently
  and collaboratively\, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Pa
 ssport\,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines\, and
  ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates 
 their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information\, contact rcast
 onguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway

 k signing\n\n**Book Synopsis:**\n\nSetting goals is easy. Finishing them i
 s the challenge.\n\nIn ***'Intentional* '--productivity expert Chris Baile
 y** reveals the surprising truth: **willpower isn’t enough**. The secret
  to accomplishing your goals lies in **being more intentional.** Bailey di
 stills a decade of deep research on productivity to deliver a profound\, p
 ractical\, and counterintuitive roadmap to getting things done. Forget end
 less to-do lists and a never-ending workload. To reach your goals\, you ha
 ve to structure your daily actions around what’s most important to you
 —and let go of the rest.\n\nThis way\, getting things done becomes secon
 d nature.\n\nIntegrating the science of desire\, values\, and procrastinat
 ion with the wisdom of Buddhist monks\, Bailey empowers us to build a life
  of true purpose and accomplishment. He offers practical strategies for fo
 llowing through on our goals\, including how to:\n\n* Structure goals for 
 maximum completion\n* Make unappealing\, boring\, or challenging tasks mor
 e attractive to tackle\n* Lower the chance of procrastinating on long-term
  goals\n* Create a framework for tracking intentions and progress\n* Know 
 when a goal isn’t for you—and when it’s time to let it go\n\nFinishi
 ng what you start is more possible than you think!!\n\n**Ticket link here:

SUMMARY:TD Music celebrates Black History Month
DESCRIPTION:As part of the TD Music Series\, Join us for a live music performance in the West Wing with performances by:  Dylan Sinclair and King Cruff \nThis ongoing series brings vibrant sets from emerging and established artists to Union’s public spaces\, transforming daily commutes into moments of cultural celebration and connection. \nDylan Sinclair is a Canadian R&B singer-songwriter from Toronto\, Ontario\, whose full-length debut album Proverb was a Juno Award nominee for Traditional R&B/Soul Recording of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2021.\nHe has been a part of the record labels Prodigal\, Five Stones Media and Five Stone Records Inc. \nMC King Cruff (Solomon Marley-Spence) was Jamaican-raised\, Toronto-based born with the talents of songwriting and performance in his blood. The Tuff Gong/Universal Music Canada-signed artist sees his songs as think pieces set to ‘punky’ rhythms. Drawing on his own audio engineering background\, the versatile King Cruff fuses genres across the diaspora including hip-hop\, Afrobeats\, dancehall and reggae into his original ‘punky’ sound. An introspective storyteller\, King Cruff explores the juxtapositions of human behavior with energizing\, innovative sounds that uplift and inspire for an ear-bending amalgam of Black musical styles.\n\nSource: Union Station Toronto

SUMMARY:Metamorphosis XIX: ALIENS!!!!
DESCRIPTION:February 20\, 2026  // 10pm\nEarly Bird $15 // General $25 //  Door $35\nall prices + fees\nBUY TICKETS \nToronto’s T4T rave haven is hatching from its ovomorph and making its long-awaited return this February with an extraterrestrial entropy of light and sound. Metamorphosis invites you to usher in a new eon in a brand new venue! The mothership will be touching down at Buddies in Bad Times\, transforming the cabaret into a Gigerian trip. \nWe are proud to present a wide array of hypnotic\, otherworldly sounds from a lineup of all local\, all trans talent: \nHectik and Nolly will be stepping up to the Metamorphosis decks for the very first time with psychedelic musical stylings alongside Mission Control and an epic B2B from Rata and Zellers. Prepare to be abducted and taken far\, far away! \nThis is a party for trans people first. Allies are welcome\, so long as you’re an ALLY\, and not just a tolerator. All attendees are implored to challenge earthy conventions\, and discover who they would be in a post-gender\, post-human world.\n\nSource: Buddies in Bad Times Theatre

We do this to ensure we don’t exceed our capacity for indoor events or the maximum limits for group sizes on High Park’s ecologically sensitive trails. Please register on our website before coming to High Park. We cannot guarantee availability of walk-in spots. If an event is at capacity\, please put yourself on our waitlist.

SUMMARY:Rooted & Reaching: Art Therapy at The Garden
DESCRIPTION:Join Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee\, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching\, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down\, ground yourself\, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation\, open-ended art-making\, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts\, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth\, connection\, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle\, creative spaces that support care\, growth\, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process\, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes\, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required\, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork\, offering a supportive space to reflect\, connect\, and simply be. \nPlease note\, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand\, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays\, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15\, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier\, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Presence\, arriving\, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space\, the body\, and the group. This session focuses on grounding\, safety\, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd\, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness\, inviting participants to notice texture\, sound\, colour\, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th\, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature\, others\, ourselves. This session explores how we connect\, separate\, and relate—within ourselves\, with others\, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness\, boundaries\, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th\, 2026 \nTheme: Growth\, loss\, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles\, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth\, rest\, grief\, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration\, personal meaning\, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st\, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world\, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people\, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

SUMMARY: bentway after school - for curious and creative community explor
 ers\, ages 9-14
DESCRIPTION:If you're looking for a creative\, after-school\, winter prog
 ram in downtown Toronto\, check out the "Bentway after school".\n\nThe Be
 ntway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with 
 lots of fun\, creativity\, and outdoor discovery along the way. The progr
 am empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban de
 sign\, city building\, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigatio
 ns\, storytelling\, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session optio
 ns\, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or
  both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  *
  The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will
  be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and 
 February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic\, figure-8 skate
  trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is
  held across The Bentway sites\, including indoor and outdoor activities 
 and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the ele
 ments and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender
  washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut
 -sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff\, p
 lease do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts\, nuts and al
 l other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent follo
 wing online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” 
 — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session\, young urbanists will 
 ask questions\, gather information\, compare and collaborate\, draw concl
 usions\, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\
 nInteractive experiences including site tours\, outdoor recreation\, and 
 hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth ed
 ucation leaders Maximum City\, will encourage participants to not only ex
 plore The Bentway\, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s hist
 ory\, current state\, and potential future through skill building in mult
 idisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping
 \, ecology\, storytelling\, adaptation\, and youth agency\, the program e
 mpowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can becom
 e when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently
  and collaboratively\, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Pa
 ssport\,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines\, and
  ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates 
 their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information\, contact rcast
 onguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway

Studio members made the works on display through a series of workshops led by local ceramic artists Japneet Kaur\, Zoë Pinnell\, and Nurielle Stern. In the workshops\, each artist shared their particular approach\, which the participants adapted to their own ways of making. The series sought to strengthen technical skills\, broaden conceptual strategies\, and build professional networks. \nFor many Inspirations Studio members\, intersecting systemic barriers and the lack of accessible art spaces in the GTA have hindered opportunities for artistic growth. This workshop series aimed to address this imbalance. Presenting the resulting artworks at the Gardiner Museum highlights the work of Inspirations Studio and its members\, while offering space for new narratives to emerge. \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    About Inspirations Studios \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                    Inspirations Studio was founded in 1994 to provide studio access\, storefront selling opportunities\, arts education\, and professional training opportunities to women who have experienced multiple forms of discrimination. The Studio’s core mission is to contribute to improving women’s lives through the making and selling of pottery. Through creative\, therapeutic\, and skill-building work\, women gain self-confidence and stability while connecting to community. Studio members also gain a source of supplemental income and find a new way to engage with the world as makers. Art—and ceramics in particular—can bring change and offer healing\, while giving people purpose\, pride\, passion\, and joy. Inspirations Studio workshop and storefront space is located at 389 Church St\, on the main floor of YWCA Toronto’s supportive housing building.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n                \n                     \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum

The result is an environment that feels alive and in motion\, offering audiences an encounter that is both visceral and contemplative.\nLearn more \n  \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum

SUMMARY:Together Toronto
DESCRIPTION:TechTO\n\\*\\*This is a paid event\, please register via our L
 uma Page. You need to have a ticket in order to attend this event: https:/
 /luma.com/together-toronto-mar-2-2026\n\n**​Together Toronto brings the 
 city’s tech community together for an evening of connection\, inspiratio
 n\, and learning**\n\n​Together Toronto is where the city’s most passi
 onate tech builders\, thinkers\, and doers come together to learn from the
  journeys that rarely get shared. At this signature event\, we spotlight r
 eal stories from founders who’ve navigated the ups\, downs\, and in-betw
 eens of building in Toronto’s fast-moving tech scene. These aren’t pol
 ished pitches or surface-level panels\, they’re honest\, behind-the-scen
 es conversations that reveal what it actually takes to launch\, scale\, an
 d grow a company.\n\n​You’ll hear from entrepreneurs who’ve taken bo
 ld bets\, faced unexpected challenges\, and found creative ways to move fo
 rward. Their stories offer more than inspiration - they deliver lessons\, 
 frameworks\, and insights that can change how you approach your own work. 
 Whether you're starting your first venture\, scaling a team\, or simply cu
 rious about how Canadian leading companies are built\, this event is for y
 ou.\n\nThis event is about more than just listening\, it’s about connect
 ing. You’ll be in a room full of founders\, investors\, operators\, and 
 future collaborators who believe in the power of community. It’s a chanc
 e to meet the people building what's next\, share ideas\, and be part of s
 omething bigger than yourself.\n\nSource: Meetup: TechTO

SUMMARY:Rooted & Reaching: Art Therapy at The Garden
DESCRIPTION:Join Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee\, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching\, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down\, ground yourself\, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation\, open-ended art-making\, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts\, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth\, connection\, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle\, creative spaces that support care\, growth\, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process\, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes\, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required\, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork\, offering a supportive space to reflect\, connect\, and simply be. \nPlease note\, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand\, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays\, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15\, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier\, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Presence\, arriving\, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space\, the body\, and the group. This session focuses on grounding\, safety\, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd\, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness\, inviting participants to notice texture\, sound\, colour\, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th\, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature\, others\, ourselves. This session explores how we connect\, separate\, and relate—within ourselves\, with others\, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness\, boundaries\, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th\, 2026 \nTheme: Growth\, loss\, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles\, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth\, rest\, grief\, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration\, personal meaning\, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st\, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world\, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people\, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

SUMMARY: bentway after school - for curious and creative community explor
 ers\, ages 9-14
DESCRIPTION:If you're looking for a creative\, after-school\, winter prog
 ram in downtown Toronto\, check out the "Bentway after school".\n\nThe Be
 ntway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with 
 lots of fun\, creativity\, and outdoor discovery along the way. The progr
 am empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban de
 sign\, city building\, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigatio
 ns\, storytelling\, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session optio
 ns\, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or
  both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  *
  The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will
  be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and 
 February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic\, figure-8 skate
  trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is
  held across The Bentway sites\, including indoor and outdoor activities 
 and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the ele
 ments and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender
  washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut
 -sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff\, p
 lease do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts\, nuts and al
 l other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent follo
 wing online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” 
 — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session\, young urbanists will 
 ask questions\, gather information\, compare and collaborate\, draw concl
 usions\, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\
 nInteractive experiences including site tours\, outdoor recreation\, and 
 hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth ed
 ucation leaders Maximum City\, will encourage participants to not only ex
 plore The Bentway\, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s hist
 ory\, current state\, and potential future through skill building in mult
 idisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping
 \, ecology\, storytelling\, adaptation\, and youth agency\, the program e
 mpowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can becom
 e when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently
  and collaboratively\, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Pa
 ssport\,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines\, and
  ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates 
 their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information\, contact rcast
 onguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway

This once-in-a-generation renovation reimagined the Gardiner’ss role as an inspiring and accessible community-driven hub where clay serves as a bridge between cultures\, histories\, and people. Designed by Montgomery Sisam Architects and Andrew Jones Design\, in collaboration with architect Chris Cornelius of studio:indigenous\, the transformation of the Gardiner’s 9\,000-square-foot ground floor was guided by the principles of connectivity\, access\, and Indigeneity. It features new Collection Galleries\, a fully equipped Makerspace\, a Community Learning Centre\, and the Gardiner’s first-ever gallery of Indigenous ceramics.\nLearn more \n\n                \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Gardiner Museum

SUMMARY:Rooted & Reaching: Art Therapy at The Garden
DESCRIPTION:Join Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee\, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching\, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down\, ground yourself\, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation\, open-ended art-making\, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts\, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth\, connection\, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle\, creative spaces that support care\, growth\, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process\, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes\, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required\, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork\, offering a supportive space to reflect\, connect\, and simply be. \nPlease note\, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand\, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays\, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15\, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier\, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Presence\, arriving\, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space\, the body\, and the group. This session focuses on grounding\, safety\, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd\, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness\, inviting participants to notice texture\, sound\, colour\, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th\, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature\, others\, ourselves. This session explores how we connect\, separate\, and relate—within ourselves\, with others\, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness\, boundaries\, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th\, 2026 \nTheme: Growth\, loss\, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles\, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth\, rest\, grief\, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration\, personal meaning\, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st\, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world\, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people\, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

SUMMARY:ABCD Reads AND Watches "Bullet Train"
DESCRIPTION:A Book Club\, Downtown (ABCD)\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/
 results/6251599225946112) of the poll for this event]\n\nABCD Reads AND Wa
 tches "**Bullet Train**"\, a novel by Kōtarō Isaka\, and a movie adaptat
 ion starring Brad Pitt.\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n"A dark\, satirical t
 hriller by the bestselling Japanese author\, following the perilous train 
 ride of five highly motivated assassins.\nA massive bestseller in Japan\, 
 Bullet Train is an original and propulsive thriller that fizzes with an in
 credible energy and surprising humor as its complex net of double-crosses 
 and twists unwind. Award-winning author Kotaro Isaka takes readers on a te
 nsion packed journey as the bullet train hurtles toward its final destinat
 ion. Who will make it off the train alive—and what awaits them at the la
 st stop?" (from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56969543-b
 ullet-train))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE MOVIE ::**\n"In Bullet Train\, Brad Pitt s
 tars as Ladybug\, an unlucky assassin determined to do his job peacefully 
 after one too many gigs gone off the rails. Fate\, however\, may have othe
 r plans\, as Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with 
 lethal adversaries from around the globe -- all with connected\, yet confl
 icting\, objectives -- on the world's fastest train. From the director of 
 Deadpool 2\, David Leitch\, the end of the line is only the beginning in a
  wild\, non-stop thrill ride through modern-day Japan." (from [Rotten Toma
 toes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bullet_train_2022))\n\n**:: ABOUT T
 HE EVENT ::**\nInstead of just reading the book as usual\, this time we're
  asking that you also watch the movie adaptation. During our discussion\, 
 we'll explore the strengths of both the book and the movie\, evaluate the 
 adaptation's effectiveness\, and touch on any other topics that arise.\n\n
 You are welcome to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes 
 or longer afterward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.
 \n\nPlease ensure you have read the book and watched the movie before atte
 nding (though finishing either is not a barrier to participating\, as long
  as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nFirst-time attendees can join for free. I
 f the event is full\, we maintain an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Mic
 hael](https://www.meetup.com/members/55295192/) a direct message for more 
 information\, in either case.\n\nWe request a $3 contribution from regular
  attendees to help cover our monthly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT 
 READ&WATCH ::**\nAt the end of each event\, we will ask for nominees for o
 ur next Read & Watch (date TBA). If you have a good pairing in mind\, plea
 se ensure that the book is between 200-400 pages long\, available from the
  Toronto Public Library\, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (tho
 ugh these are not hard and fast rules)\, and that the movie or TV-series i
 s readily available. When enough nominees are collected\, Michael will sen
 d the members a direct message with a link where you can vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown

SUMMARY: bentway after school - for curious and creative community explor
 ers\, ages 9-14
DESCRIPTION:If you're looking for a creative\, after-school\, winter prog
 ram in downtown Toronto\, check out the "Bentway after school".\n\nThe Be
 ntway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with 
 lots of fun\, creativity\, and outdoor discovery along the way. The progr
 am empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban de
 sign\, city building\, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigatio
 ns\, storytelling\, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session optio
 ns\, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or
  both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  *
  The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will
  be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and 
 February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic\, figure-8 skate
  trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is
  held across The Bentway sites\, including indoor and outdoor activities 
 and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the ele
 ments and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender
  washrooms are available on-site.\n  * The Bentway Studio is a peanut/nut
 -sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff\, p
 lease do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts\, nuts and al
 l other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent follo
 wing online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” 
 — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session\, young urbanists will 
 ask questions\, gather information\, compare and collaborate\, draw concl
 usions\, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\
 nInteractive experiences including site tours\, outdoor recreation\, and 
 hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth ed
 ucation leaders Maximum City\, will encourage participants to not only ex
 plore The Bentway\, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s hist
 ory\, current state\, and potential future through skill building in mult
 idisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping
 \, ecology\, storytelling\, adaptation\, and youth agency\, the program e
 mpowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can becom
 e when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently
  and collaboratively\, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Pa
 ssport\,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines\, and
  ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates 
 their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information\, contact rcast
 onguay@thebentway.ca mailto:rcastonguay@thebentway.ca or visit thebentway

SUMMARY:2026 Fred Kan Distinguished Lecture in Engineering Ethics
DESCRIPTION:Promoting ethical engineering research is necessary given the potential for widespread social and technological impacts of these research outcomes. But what motivates engineers to think and act ethically\, particularly in the domain of research?   \nIn this interactive talk\, Dr. Justin L. Hess will address this question by sharing types of critical incidents experienced by engineering faculty who conduct biomedical engineering research. The incident types denote the formative impacts of professional culture and academic norms\, engaging in ethical behaviors\, observing questionable behaviors\, attending to novel perspectives\, formal and informal training and mentoring events\, and reflecting on one’s own views and experiences. By understanding what experiences inspire engineers to think and act ethically\, institutions of higher education and engineering organizations will be better positioned to support ethical growth be it in formal courses\, faculty research labs\, organizational training efforts\, or by reshaping institutional norms. Cost: Free\nLimited alumni tickets available.   \nRegister now\nRegister by March 2\, 2026. Limited alumni tickets available. \nRead more about the Fred Kan lecture series. \nFor questions or more information\, please contact istep@utoronto.ca. \nAbout the speaker: Professor Justin L. Hess\nDr. Justin L. Hess is an associate professor in the School of Engineering Education\, where he also co-directs the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies undergraduate programs. Dr. Hess’s research explores how engineers develop ethical and empathic dispositions. He received his PhD in Engineering Education from Purdue University in 2015\, and his BS/MS in Civil Engineering from Purdue in 2011 and 2015\, respectively. He served as the assistant director of the STEM Education Research Institute at Purdue University for four years (2015-2019) before returning to Purdue as a tenure-track faculty member in 2019.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering

SUMMARY:What Inspires Ethical Research? Lessons from Biomedical Engineering Faculty
DESCRIPTION:Fred Kan Distinguished Lecture In Engineering Ethics 2026\nPromoting ethical engineering research is necessary given the potential for widespread social and technological impacts of engineering research outcomes. But what motivates engineers to think and act ethically\, particularly in the domain of research? In this interactive talk\, Dr. Justin L. Hess will address this question by sharing types of critical incidents experienced by engineering faculty who conduct biomedical engineering research. The incident types denote the formative impacts of professional culture and academic norms\, engaging in ethical behaviors\, observing questionable behaviors\, attending to novel perspectives\, formal and informal training and mentoring events\, and reflecting on one’s own views and experiences. By understanding what experiences inspire engineers to think and act ethically\, institutions of higher education and engineering organizations will be better positioned to support ethical growth be it in formal courses\, faculty research labs\, organizational training efforts\, or by reshaping institutional norms.  \nAbout the Speaker: \n\nDr. Justin L. Hess is an associate professor in the School of Engineering Education\, where he also co-directs the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies undergraduate programs. Dr. Hess’s research explores how engineers develop ethical and empathic dispositions. He received his PhD in Engineering Education from Purdue University in 2015\, and his BS/MS in Civil Engineering from Purdue in 2011 and 2015\, respectively. He served as the assistant director of the STEM Education Research Institute at Purdue University for four years (2015-2019) before returning to Purdue as a tenure-track faculty member in 2019.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering

SUMMARY:Logic and Philosophy of Science Group Talk (Sorin Bangu\, Bergen)
DESCRIPTION:The Logic and Philosophy of Science Group is pleased to welcome as guest speaker Sorin Bangu\, a professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bergen in Norway. Dr. Bangu works in philosophy of science (especially philosophy of mathematics and physics)\, with further interests in Wittgenstein and Quine. He is involved in the activities of the Wittgenstein Archives Bergen and serves as a co-editor of its open access journal\, Nordic Wittgenstein Review. \nTalk Title\nThe Odd Couple: later Wittgenstein and Quine on the Existence of Numbers \nTalk Abstract\nThe aim of this talk is to sketch and contrast later Wittgenstein’s and Quine’s views on the perennial\, and central\, question in metaphysics and in the philosophy of mathematics: do numbers exist? Against the background of an example involving elementary arithmetic\, I’ll maintain that they are indeed an odd couple: their views are both very different\, but also related. I’ll argue that one of them (easy to guess who) holds that ‘the question contains a mistake’\, so can’t even be meaningfully asked\, let alone answered — which is disturbing news for both the realist and the antirealist projects in the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Quine\, on the other hand\, contends that the answer to the question is affirmative. However\, his reason to answer so is quite provocative as well\, for it illustrates a pragmatic approach to metaphysical question. It relies on the contingent fact that mathematics is successfully applied — that it is\, in fact\, indispensable to science and everyday life. It is this perspective\, the paramount role assigned to the applicability of mathematics\, that he and Wittgenstein share.\nAbout the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group\nOne of six departmental Research Interest Groups\, the Logic and Philosophy of Science Group hosts talks on logic\, general philosophy of science\, and philosophy of the particular sciences\, as well as talks in allied areas such as formal epistemology\, decision theory\, and the metaphysics of science.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy

We do this to ensure we don’t exceed our capacity for indoor events or the maximum limits for group sizes on High Park’s ecologically sensitive trails. Please register on our website before coming to High Park. We cannot guarantee availability of walk-in spots. If an event is at capacity\, please put yourself on our waitlist. We will notify waitlisted participants if we open up new spots or sessions for our events.

Snowshoes will be provided by the High Park Nature Centre. Note: This event is highly snow-dependent. The program may be modified or canceled if the forecast changes. What to Wear Unlike skis\, snowshoes don’t require special boots.  Snowshoes can be adjusted to fit most winter boots.  Insulated\, waterproof winter boots are ideal for snowshoeing. This is an entirely outdoor event making dressing for the weather important.  Please come dressed in warm outer and inner layers including\, winter coats\, snow pants\, mitts\, gloves\, scarves\, toques\, etc.   Price: $30 (Children 12 and Under – $20)Ages: 6+ years\, Family-friendly\, Adults accompanying children must register for the eventMeeting Location: High Park Forest School\, 375 Colborne Lodge Drive 								\n				\n				\n				\n									\n					\n						\n									Event Cancelled\n					\n					\n				\n								\n				\n					\n		\n					\n		\n				\n						\n					\n			\n						\n				\n																														\n				\n				\n				\n																														\n				\n				\n						\n					\n			\n							\n		\n				\n			\n						\n				\n							\n							\n					\n												\n															\n								\n													\n												Date & Time\n					\n\n					Day: Saturday\, February 7\, 2026Time: 10AM-12 PM\n				\n							\n					\n												\n															\n								\n													\n												Location\n					\n\n					This event will start at the High Park Forest School building located at 375 Colborne Lodge Drive.

In case you’re driving we strongly recommend you to park your car at the public parking lot near Grenadier Cafe. We continue to recommend using the TTC or biking as the best way to get to High Park and the Nature Centre. The Nature Centre is situated just a 5-minute walk from the High Park Subway Station. Please note\, High Park is closed to cars on the weekends. If your event is on a weekend\, you will need to park outside the park and walk in\, or take transit.

SUMMARY:Milkweed Meadow: Needle Felting & Embroidery 2-Day Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Join us for this beginner-friendly 2-day workshop and learn needle felting & embroidery techniques!\n\n\nDiscover the beauty and ecological importance of milkweed through fiber art at the Toronto Botanical Gardens! In this immersive two-day workshop\, you’ll create a textile artwork inspired by actual milkweed herbarium specimens—plants that are essential to monarch butterflies and countless other pollinators. \nWorking with a soft palette of greens\, browns\, warm pinks\, and purples on creamy white felt\, you’ll learn two complementary textile techniques: needle felting (which allows you to “paint” with wool) and hand embroidery (which adds intricate detail and texture). No prior drawing or embroidery experience is necessary. \nMilkweed is one of nature’s most remarkable plants\, playing a critical role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining fragile ecosystems. For monarch butterflies\, milkweed is literally a matter of survival—it is the only plant on which they can lay their eggs\, and milkweed leaves are the sole food source for their caterpillars. The plant’s leaves also provide monarchs with chemical defenses against predators\, while its nectar-rich flowers fuel the adults’ incredible multi-generational migrations across thousands of miles. \nBeyond monarchs\, milkweed is a keystone species that supports an entire web of life. Its flowers provide essential nectar for bees\, wasps\, flies\, and hummingbirds\, while its distinctive seed pods offer nourishment for birds. \nBy creating art inspired by milkweed\, we celebrate this extraordinary plant and reflect on ecosystems and interconnection. \nDay One: Needle Felting Foundations \n\nIntroduction to milkweed ecology and examination of herbarium specimens\nObservational drawing: tracing and adapting milkweed forms to create your unique composition\nTransferring your drawing onto felt backing\nNeedle felting techniques: learning to “paint” with wool roving\nBuilding up layers of color and creating shading effects\nDeveloping leaves\, stems\, seed pods\, and flowers using our nature-inspired color palette\n\nDay Two: Embroidery Details \n\nReview of Day One work and troubleshooting\nIntroduction to hand embroidery stitches for adding definition and detail\nStitching techniques for different elements: veining in leaves\, texture in seed pods\, delicate flower details\nCombining needle felting and embroidery for dimensional effects\nFinishing techniques and backing options\nCare instructions and ideas for continuing your practice at home\n\nWhat You’ll Learn \n\nHow to translate natural forms into fiber art through observational drawing and tracing\nNeedle felting fundamentals: choosing needles\, controlling wool placement\, creating gradients and shading\nEssential embroidery stitches for botanical details\nColor theory and blending techniques specific to wool\nHow to combine two textile techniques for rich\, layered results\nStrategies for creating depth\, dimension\, and naturalistic effects\n\nAll materials are provided\, and you’ll take home supplies to continue your creative practice. Optional items to bring: \n\nComfortable clothing (small wool fibers may cling to fabric)\nAn apron or smock if desired\nA camera or phone to photograph the herbarium specimens (optional—printed reference images will be provided)\n\nSchedule: Sunday\, March 15 and 22 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. There will be a one-hour break for lunch. We recommend bringing a lunch as there are limited options nearby. \nRegistration: Public $145\, Members $125 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \n \nAbout Amanda McCavour\nAmanda McCavour is a Canadian artist who works with stitch to create large-scale embroidered installations. \nHer immersive installations speak to themes of memory\, environment\, colour and line. She is interested in finding connections between scientific research and decorative patterns found in textiles and wallpaper. Her lace-like pieces are made by sewing into fabric that dissolves in water. When the fabric is dissolved\, the thread drawings interlock together even without a base. Plants and their ecologies are similarly linked—a biological network is a bound system that sustains a community of plants. \nMcCavour holds a BFA from York University and an MFA in Fibers and Material Studies from Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. McCavour shows her work in galleries nationally and internationally and has completed residencies at Harbourfront Centre’s Textile Studio in Toronto\, and the Klondike Institute of Art and Culture in Dawson City\, Yukon. She has been recognized by the Ontario Crafts Council\, The Canada Council for the Arts\, The Handweavers and Spinners Guild of America\, The Ontario Society of Artists\, The Surface Design Association\, and The Embroiderers Guild of America. \n \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking.

SUMMARY:Rooted & Reaching: Art Therapy at The Garden
DESCRIPTION:Join Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee\, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching\, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down\, ground yourself\, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation\, open-ended art-making\, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts\, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth\, connection\, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle\, creative spaces that support care\, growth\, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process\, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes\, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required\, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork\, offering a supportive space to reflect\, connect\, and simply be. \nPlease note\, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand\, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays\, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15\, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier\, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Presence\, arriving\, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space\, the body\, and the group. This session focuses on grounding\, safety\, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd\, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness\, inviting participants to notice texture\, sound\, colour\, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th\, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature\, others\, ourselves. This session explores how we connect\, separate\, and relate—within ourselves\, with others\, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness\, boundaries\, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th\, 2026 \nTheme: Growth\, loss\, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles\, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth\, rest\, grief\, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration\, personal meaning\, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st\, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking. A TBG membership helps you deepen your knowledge and connection to the natural world\, become a part of a dynamic community of plant people\, and be inspired! Become a member! \nAdditional Program Information\n\nFor more information on accessibility at the garden please review our Accessibility Features webpage.

From the process of garden planning to vegetable selection and seeding\, these workshops will provide you with the knowledge and tools to create your own successful and productive garden. Everyone is welcome at this workshop\, which is geared to novice and intermediate gardeners. \nSchedule: Wednesdays\, March 18\, 25\, April 1 and 8 from 7 to 9 p.m. (four sessions). \nRegistration: Public $100\, TBG Members $85 (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nProgram Schedule: \nSession 1 – From Balconies to Backyards: Planning a Successful Vegetable Garden \nWednesday\, March 18: \nAre you growing vegetables for the first time or aiming to increase the productivity of an existing vegetable patch? This session will highlight key factors to consider when planning a vegetable garden in a variety of growing spaces. Participants will have the opportunity to begin designing a garden plan with the help of a Toronto Master Gardener. A pre-measure or thought about size and area of your proposed garden is recommended. Basic sketching materials will be provided. Come prepared with your dreams & ideas! \nSession 2 – What does it all mean!? Demystifying gardening terminology and deciding what to plant! \nWednesday\, March 25: \nFabaceae and Solanaceae\, Heirloom\, Open-pollinated and Hybrid – oh my! Gardening can feel like learning a new language. In this session we’ll demystify the terminology first\, then work on choosing plants that will suit your conditions and thrive. Participants will learn key tips for reading seed catalogues and packets with confidence. Building on your garden plan this session will guide you in choosing specific vegetables to grow. Participants will learn about vegetable selection\, planting strategies and begin work on their own personalized planting plan. \nSession 3 – Tips for a successful crop and plentiful harvest \nWedesday\, April 1: \nIn this session\, we’ll take a deeper dive into some of the most commonly grown vegetables\, exploring their growth habits\, plant care\, disease prevention\, and harvesting techniques. You’ll learn practical tips and tricks for producing a successful crop\, along with strategies for extending the growing season and harvesting more than one crop from the same space. Participants are encouraged to bring a cell phone\, iPad\, or other WiFi-enabled device to join a fun Kahoot quiz! \nSession 4 – Starting Your Veggies From Seed \nWednesday\, April 8: \nWould you like to grow veggies that have been in your family for generations\, maybe even start homesteading\, or perhaps (like many of us) just have fun experimenting with a home garden? From seed sowing to thinning plants\, learning the difference between cotyledons and true leaves\, knowing when to use warming pads or grow-lights … in this seminar you’ll learn everything you didn’t know you needed to know to start growing veggies and herbs from seed! Our workshop activity will be learning how to plant seeds and transplant seedlings. \nAbout Toronto Master Gardeners (TMG) \nToronto Master Gardeners (TMG) is a volunteer not-for-profit organization that shares current\, science-based horticultural information with the gardening public through various channels\, including in person\, in print\, through the media\, and online.

SUMMARY:Robotics Institute Seminar: Sergey Stavisky\, “A multi-modal brain-computer interface for restoring lost communication”
DESCRIPTION:A multi-modal brain-computer interface for restoring lost communication \nJoin in-person in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nRestoring the ability to communicate to people with neurological injuries has long been a goal of neurotechnology research; today\, this dream is on the verge of fruition with ongoing commercial cursor and click brain-computer interface (BCI) clinical trials. I will describe our lab’s development of an intracortical speech BCI\, which is the next frontier in restoring communication. First\, we built a 99% word accuracy “brain-to-text” speech BCI. To this core capability\, we’ve added neural cursor control over the participant’s personal computer (despite recording from orofacial cortex). We’ve also augmented text decoding with a loudness layer and a gesture (emoji) layer\, both of which provide added expressivity\, and we prototyped a neural error decoder which can reduce user frustration. Lastly\, I’ll describe our progress towards an instantaneous voice synthesis BCI aimed at functionally replacing the paralyzed vocal system. \nSpeaker bio \n\nI’m a neuroscientist and neural engineer working at the intersection of systems and computational neuroscience\, neural engineering\, and machine learning. I’m trying to understand how the brain controls movements\, and to use this knowledge to build brain-computer interface (BCIs) that treat brain injury and disease. My immediate goals are to develop BCIs for restoring speech. Closely related\, I’m developing next-generation neural interfaces for human use. \nAs an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California\, Davis\, I co-direct the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab . Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Stanford Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory led by Jaimie Henderson and Krishna Shenoy.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering

SUMMARY:Rooted & Reaching: Art Therapy at The Garden
DESCRIPTION:Join Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee\, for a weekly open art therapy experience! \nStep into the garden and take a pause with Rooted & Reaching\, a weekly open art therapy group for adults offered in collaboration with the Toronto Botanical Garden. You’re invited to slow down\, ground yourself\, and explore your inner world through gentle meditation\, open-ended art-making\, and optional sharing. Guided by nature-inspired prompts\, we’ll use the garden as a space and metaphor for growth\, connection\, and belonging. \nThe group is facilitated by Mahja Kabir\, an artist and art therapy trainee who creates gentle\, creative spaces that support care\, growth\, and connection. Art therapy supports emotional expression and relational attunement through the creative process\, with no focus on artistic skill or final outcomes. \nSessions feature standalone themes\, allowing participants to attend any number of weeks across the six-week series. \nNo art experience is required\, only presence and curiosity. The focus is on the creative process rather than the final artwork\, offering a supportive space to reflect\, connect\, and simply be. \nPlease note\, all participants will be asked to sign a consent form upon arrival to agree to participate in the clinical placement provided by art therapy interns of the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. If you would like to view the consent form beforehand\, please reach out to ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca. \nSchedule: \nTuesdays\, February 24 through March 31 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. \nRegistration: Public $15\, TBG Members $10 per session (plus applicable taxes and fees) \nIf the ticket price is a barrier\, please email ProgramSupport@torontobotanicalgarden.ca to request a supported ticket. \n\nWeek 1 – Arriving & Rooting – February 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Presence\, arriving\, grounding. An invitation to slow down and arrive in the space\, the body\, and the group. This session focuses on grounding\, safety\, and finding a sense of support through connection with the natural environment. \n\n\nWeek 2 – Attuning to the Senses – March 3rd\, 2026 \nTheme: Listening to the body and environment. A gentle exploration of sensory awareness\, inviting participants to notice texture\, sound\, colour\, and movement in both the garden and themselves. Emphasis is placed on embodied presence rather than analysis. \n\n\nWeek 3 – Connection & Relationship – March 10th\, 2026 \nTheme: How we relate to nature\, others\, ourselves. This session explores how we connect\, separate\, and relate—within ourselves\, with others\, and with the living world. Nature is used as a mirror to reflect patterns of closeness\, boundaries\, and interdependence. \n\n\nWeek 4 – Seasons and Cycles – March 17th\, 2026 \nTheme: Growth\, loss\, transformation. Drawing inspiration from natural cycles\, this session invites reflection on change and transition. Participants may explore personal seasons of growth\, rest\, grief\, or renewal through symbolic art-making. \n\n\nWeek 5 – Inner landscape – March 24th\, 2026 \nTheme: Self-reflection through nature symbolism. A space to reflect on the experience of the group and what participants wish to take with them. This session focuses on integration\, personal meaning\, and ongoing connection to creativity and nature beyond the program. \n\n\nWeek 6 – Integration & Carrying Forward – March 31st\, 2026 \nTheme: Meaning making and continuity. A reflective closing session focused on integration and what participants wish to carry forward beyond the group. \n\n  \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking.

She discovered this art form when she was looking for a creative outlet from her engineering job. She was amazed by the possibilities and beauty of paper quilling\, that she decided to pursue it as a full-time career. Since then\, she has been passionately mastering this technique and has created many artworks drawing inspiration from nature\, music and travel. She cuts the paper strips in different widths to add depth and dimension to her creations. She loves to play with the colours and experiment with the quilling techniques to create her own distinctive style.

SUMMARY:Global Philosophy Research Interest Group Talk (Sayeh Meisami\, Dayton)
DESCRIPTION:The Global Philosophy Research Interest Group is delighted to welcome as guest speaker Sayeh Meisami\, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Dayton. Dr. Meisami has published several books and articles in the fields of philosophy and religion. She is the author of Mulla Sadra (2013)\, Knowledge and Power in the Philosophies of Ḥamīd al-Dīn Kirmānī and Mullā Ṣadrā Shīrāzī (2018)\, and Nasir al-Din Tusi: A Philosopher for All Seasons (2019). In line with her interdisciplinary interests\, her most recent articles demonstrate the significance of poetic techniques of thinking and writing in later Islamic philosophy and sufism\, and her ongoing research is on the continuity of mythological and philosophical discourses in the Persianate context. \nTalk Title\nPoetic Thinking and the Divergent Philosophies of Rumi and Heidegger \nTalk Abstract\n\nThe talk is a critical analysis of Martin Heidegger’s engagement with “poetic thinking” by comparing it to that of Rumi’s. The comparison aims to investigate how a poetic thinker’s historical\, cultural\, and lived experiences fundamentally shape the ethical and sociopolitical outcomes of the discourses they create in their philosophies. I attempt to demonstrate that Heidegger correctly considers poetic thinking as a wholesome conflict between conceptualization and experiential finding that is essential to authentic human experience. This is exemplified by his reading of German lyrical voices\, such as Hölderlin\, that is conditioned by Eurocentrism and German exceptionalism.  I argue that both Heidegger and Rumi are great at poetic thinking and for this reason their starkly different lived experiences lead them to diverging directions:  Heidegger’s poetic thinking unleashes the “will to power”\, and Rumi’s poetic thinking that is grounded in his experience as a multi-cultural immigrant and a lover gives rise to the “will to love.”  I will ultimately demonstrate that Rumi’s “will to love” functions as an interpretive/epistemic lens that justifies his philosophy of unity and inclusivity.   \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems\, new questions and research directions\, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy\, and Chinese philosophy\, Indian philosophy in English\, and classical Islamic philosophy.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy

  in Montreal!\n\nSomething to look forward to--as Toronto winter approache
 s. We normally post these trips 4-6 months in advance. This trip is in jus
 t 4 months.\n\n--Each trip is unique\, very organized\, individual\, and n
 ever to be repeated! For the culturally curious! Art/Food enthusiast. Expl
 orers!\n\nWe can work off a group size of 15 people.\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT**
 : Please read all the information before signing up to this trip\, as ther
 e is a **NON-refundable fee** involved upfront.\n\nCheck your schedules an
 d calendars--and then double check them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Please do not sign up
  for the trip until you've emailed me. Very important.\n\nThese are very s
 ocial trips--we are 'explorers'. Montreal treats us very well. We generall
 y walk everywhere (thousands of steps!)\n\n**We will return to Plural Cont
 emporary Art Fair for the *8th time*.**\n\n[https://www.plural.art/en](htt
 ps://www.plural.art/en)\n\n**4 nights (Wednesday\, Thursday\, Friday\, Sat
 urday--returning home on Sunday)**\n\n**Plural** celebrates the best of co
 ntemporary art in Canada. Created *by* and *for* the galleries\, the fair 
 presents and brings together the plurality of voices and works in contempo
 rary art from across the country. It elevates art market practices through
  a rigorous selection of galleries presenting thoughtfully chosen artists 
 and artworks\; and through accessible programming that addresses current i
 ssues and questions in the field of art.\n\n**Plural's 19th edition** will
  be held from April 10-12th at the Port of Montreal’s Grand Quay. (Old M
 ontreal). Just a fabulous space/btw. Old warehouse.\n\nIf you are familiar
  with Art Toronto and The Artist Project\, then you have an idea about Pap
 ier Fair. **This is Quebec's most important Art Fair. 50 booths+**\n\n**Al
 so\, on the this trip**\, we will visit OTHER larger Montreal galleries an
 d explore various smaller galleries\, food\, public art\, and architecture
 . We will meet artists\, curators\, and directors--with private tours. PLU
 S more.\n\n--We spend most of **ONE** day at the Fair\, then the other tim
 e exploring Montreal's vibrant culture scene. After 20+ past trips\, we ar
 e so fortunate to have many Montreal culture/gallery friends--they look fo
 rward to us/and we to them.\n\nOur full schedule of events is not finalize
 d until late March 2026\, but I keep you posted along the way (every month
 ). **We meet as a group** before the trip in Toronto--mid/late March. TBD\
 n\nSpecial surprises always await us in Montreal!\n\n***Here is what you n
 eed to know to make a decision:***\n\n1. **I will** provide 3 1/2 days of 
 cultural programming **on the ground**. Wednesday night\, all day Thursday
 \, all day Friday and Saturday. You return home on Sunday at your own time
 .\n2. **You are** responsible for your own travel\, accommodation\, insura
 nce and other costs you will incur. In the past\, members have travelled e
 ither by air\, VIA\, drive\, Bus. They have stayed in hotels (points)\, Ai
 rbnb\, Bed & Breakfast\, Hostel\, or with friends.\n\nBy planning ahead\, 
 you can get the best rates etc. VIA and accommodations.\n\nThere is no "wr
 ong" place to stay in Montreal\, but ideally you want to be about 1km/20 m
 ins **walk** from St. Catherine St/Place des Arts.\n\n3\\. These are full 
 trips\\\, with very little "free\\-time"\\. We are on the go\\.\n4\\. On t
 he Saturday night\\\, we have a "full Group" restaurant dinner\\. About $1
 25\\-$150 per person range\\. This is the only formal meal event I organiz
 e\\\, although other meals fall into place while there\\.\n5\\. You would 
 need to be in Montreal and ready to go by about 6pm on Wednesday April 8th
 \\\, and you return home on your own time of choosing on Sunday April 13th
 \\.\n6\\. Can you attend\\\, please be sure\\.\\.\\.\n\n**There is a non-r
 efundable fee to participate in this trip\, and you MUST connect with me b
 efore signing up on Meetup at:**\n\ntorontoisculture@gmail.com\n\nThe non-
 refundable fee is **$150 per person** payable within 2 days of signing up 
 on Meetup.\n\n7\\. For your budgeting\\\, **other** gallery/event "entry" 
 costs may total $150 maximum over the weekend.\n8\\. By planning ahead\\\,
  you can get the best rates on travel and accommodations\\. **Be proactive
 . By doing so\, this covers your non-refundable fee. I travel by VIA\, and
  stay at Airbnb.**\n9\\. These are NOT expensive trips\\-\\-but they are v
 ery rewarding\\! Much of what we do while there is FREE\\.\n\nAny question

SUMMARY:Global Philosophy Research Group Talk (Jack Beaulieu\, Oxford)
DESCRIPTION:The Global Philosophy Research Interest Group is delighted to welcome as guest speaker Jack Beaulieu\, a graduate from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Toronto and now a Fellow by Examination (Junior Research Fellow) in Philosophy at Magdalen College\, Oxford.  Dr. Beaulieu works on the history of Sanskrit philosophy\, focusing on philosophers belonging to the Nyāya and Prābhākara traditions and\, consequently\, also maintaining interests in Dharmakīrti. Dr. Beaulieu works broadly in the fields of epistemology\, philosophy of mind\, and metaphysics\, with his research to date focusing primarily on absence. He is currently working on issues related to introspection and iterated knowledge\, especially whether the former offers a route into the latter. Dr. Beaulieu also maintains active teaching interests in philosophy of disability. \nTalk Title\nTBD \nTalk Abstract\n\nTBD \n\n  \nThe Global Philosophy Research Interest Group explores the benefits of drawing on diverse traditions of thought in approaching philosophical questions. These include novel insights into familiar problems\, new questions and research directions\, and fresh methodologies. We work to deprovincialize and decolonize all aspects of philosophy in the academy. The group currently has strengths in Sanskrit philosophy\, and Chinese philosophy\, Indian philosophy in English\, and classical Islamic philosophy.\n\nSource: UofT Philosophy

Alan’s mission is to build connections to nature through arts-based education. Since 2015\, he has been partnering with non-profit environmental organizations to teach nature-focused art programs and workshops. \nAlan was responsible for the successful launch of the Toronto Nature Sketch program in 2018\, teaching all of the art lessons during that inaugural year.

In his presentation\, he shared stories behind ravine-inspired artwork created by himself and a small brigade of volunteer artists. Funds raised through the sale of the artwork were donated to ravine conservation initiatives at the garden. \nAlan currently teaches Field Sketching\, Nature Drawing and Linocut Printmaking at Toronto Botanical Garden and the High Park Nature Centre. \nwww.alanlidrawings.com \nJoin Toronto Botanical Garden\nJoin the Toronto Botanical Garden (TBG) as a member to get a discount on this program\, upcoming events and classes\, and free parking.

SUMMARY:ABCD Reads "Interpreter of Maladies" by Jhumpa Lahiri
DESCRIPTION:A Book Club\, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads "**Interpreter of Ma
 ladies**" by Jhumpa Lahiri\, a short story collection that won the Pulitze
 r Prize for Fiction in 2000.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/516
 5914897252352) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n"N
 avigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling
  new world\, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant\, touching stories 
 seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In "A Temporary 
 Matter\," published in The New Yorker\, a young Indian-American couple fac
 es the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood cop
 es with a nightly blackout. In the title story\, an interpreter guides an 
 American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonish
 ing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of An
 ita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant." (from [Goodread
 s](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies))\n\n"
 With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence\, Jhumpa Lahiri traces th
 e crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants\, expatriates\, and their ch
 ildren arrive\, quite literally\, at a cultural divide.\nA blackout forces
  a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tat
 tered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural iden
 tity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakastani civil war rages on
  television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother
  finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta. In the title story\, an interp
 reter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and h
 ears an astonishing confession.\nImbued with the sensual details of Indian
  culture\, these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has
  ever felt like a foreigner. Like the interpreter of the title story\, Lah
 iri translates between the strict traditions of her ancestors and a baffli
 ng new world." (from the [Toronto Public Library](https://tpl.bibliocommon
 s.com/v2/record/S234C194772))\n\n**:: ABOUT THE EVENT ::**\nYou are welcom
 e to arrive 30 minutes before the event and stay 30 minutes or longer afte
 rward to connect with other attendees outside the book talk.\n\nPlease ens
 ure you have read the book before attending (though finishing any book is 
 not a barrier to participating\, as long as you don't mind spoilers).\n\nF
 irst-time attendees can join for free. If the event is full\, we maintain 
 an unofficial waitlist. Please send [Michael](https://www.meetup.com/membe
 rs/55295192/) a direct message for more information\, in either case.\n\nW
 e request a $3 contribution from regular attendees to help cover our month
 ly meetup costs.\n\n**:: ABOUT OUR NEXT BOOK ::**\nAt the end of each even
 t\, we will ask for nominees for our next book. If you have a good one in 
 mind\, please ensure it is between 200-400 pages long\, available from the
  Toronto Public Library\, and counts as contemporary literary fiction (tho
 ugh these are not hard and fast rules). When enough nominees are collected
 \, Michael will send the members a direct message with a link where you ca
 n vote.\n\nSource: Meetup: A Book Club Downtown

SUMMARY:Robotics Institute Seminar: Risto Ojala\, “Perception solutions for enabling automated driving in winter conditions”
DESCRIPTION:Perception solutions for enabling automated driving in winter conditions \nJoin in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nThis talk presents methods and findings from research on perception solutions for automated driving in winter conditions\, carried out at the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory\, Aalto University. Winter conditions pose several challenges for automated vehicle perception pipelines\, which currently limit the applicability of the technology in adverse weather conditions. The talk focuses on two main research directions: denoising snowflakes from LiDAR data and road segmentation in snowy conditions. Airborne snowflakes introduce significant noise into LiDAR scans\, which can hinder downstream perception tasks. To address this challenge\, the talk presents deep learning approaches for point cloud denoising based on both supervised and self-supervised learning. In addition\, snowy conditions drastically alter the visual appearance of the environment and the road\, rendering road segmentation methods trained on traditional datasets unreliable. To overcome this\, trajectory-based approaches leveraging vision foundation models are presented for learning varied road appearance without requiring manual labeling. \nSpeaker bio \nRisto Ojala (DSc\, Tech) is an Assistant Professor at Aalto University\, Finland\, where he leads the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory within the Mechatronics research group. His research focuses on intelligent vehicles and mobile robotics\, with particular emphasis on perception\, sensor fusion\, and applied machine learning for autonomous systems. He is also currently a Visiting Scholar at Simon Fraser University\, Canada\, collaborating with the Multi-Agent Robotic Systems Laboratory on research in semantic understanding for mobile robotics. His work develops perception solutions that enable robust autonomous operation in challenging environments. A central application of his research is automated driving in winter conditions\, addressing problems such as scene understanding\, situational awareness\, and perception reliability. His work has been published in leading robotics and intelligent transportation venues and he collaborates closely with both academic and industrial partners.\n\nSource: UofT Engineering

SUMMARY:Tarragon Theatre:  cicadas
DESCRIPTION:TORONTO ARTS & CULTURE\nWorld Premiere--\n\n*Ticket link is be
 low*. $30-$72 (look at the seating map--and your age!)\n\nIn 2035\, a deca
 de after the Trinity Bellwoods Collapse\, an investigation into the myster
 ious disappearance of a young girl leads to a very peculiar house that has
  sunk into the earth.\n\n**Could a strangely luminous painting** unlock lo
 ng-buried secrets of what flowed beneath the home? Howling winds\, storms\
 , and the ever-present sound of cicadas remind us that nothing stays burie
 d.\n\n***cicadas*** is a modern eco-thriller from the minds of Governor Ge
 neral’s Award and Siminovitch Prize laureate David Yee and award-winning
  composer Chris Thornborrow that serves as both mystery and warning.\n\nDi
 rected by Nina Lee Aquino\n\nhttps://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/nina-lee-aquino\n\n
 **Ticket link here: (Sunday May 10th)**\n\nhttps://tarragontheatre.com/pla
 ys/2025-2026/cicadas/\n\n(Play around with the seating map\, and ticket pr
 ices. Any seat is a great seat--even the last row!)\n\nSource: Meetup: Toronto Arts & Culture
