Metamorphosis invites you to usher in a new eon in a brand new venue! The mothership will be touching down at Buddies in Bad Times\, transforming the cabaret into a Gigerian trip. \nWe are proud to present a wide array of hypnotic\, otherworldly sounds from a lineup of all local\, all trans talent: \nHectik and Nolly will be stepping up to the Metamorphosis decks for the very first time with psychedelic musical stylings alongside Mission Control and an epic B2B from Rata and Zellers. Prepare to be abducted and taken far\, far away! \nThis is a party for trans people first. Allies are welcome\, so long as you’re an ALLY\, and not just a tolerator. All attendees are implored to challenge earthy conventions\, and discover who they would be in a post-gender\, post-human world.
