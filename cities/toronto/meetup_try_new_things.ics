 🦋
DESCRIPTION:Try New Things in Toronto!\n**DANFORTH WALK\, BUTTERFLY MURAL 
 & GREEK LUNCH️**\n\nStreet Culture\, Public Art & A Proper Greek Feast\n
 There’s something about the Danforth that feels like old-school Toronto 
 in the best possible way — vibrant\, layered\, proudly local\, and full 
 of stories.\n\nJoin us for a social walk along one of the city’s most ic
 onic stretches: **Danforth Avenue**. As we stroll west toward downtown\, w
 e’ll pass lively patios\, long-standing family restaurants\, cozy cafés
 \, independent shops\, and the everyday rhythm of a neighbourhood that has
  shaped Toronto’s cultural identity for generations.\n\nThis area is fam
 ously home to the annual **Taste of the Danforth**\, one of the largest st
 reet festivals in the city — and historically\, it was once home to the 
 largest Greek community outside of Greece. You feel that history in the ba
 keries\, the signage\, the music drifting from open doors.\nIt’s not jus
 t a walk.\nI\nt’s a little slice of Toronto heritage — experienced tog
 ether.\n\n**Don’t forget to join our WhatsApp group** – [CLICK HERE!](

 The Butterfly Mural Stop\nAlong the way\, we’ll stop at the Butterfly Mu
 ral\, sponsored by the **David Suzuki Foundation** as part of The Great Ca
 nadian Butterflyway Project.\nIt’s bold\, colourful\, and rooted in envi
 ronmental awareness — a reminder that even in the middle of the city\, w
 e are connected to something larger. We’ll pause\, take photos\, chat\, 
 and enjoy a little moment of art-meets-nature in urban Toronto.\n\n\\*\\*\
 \*\n️ Greek Lunch at a Danforth Institution\nAfter our walk\, we’ll si
 t down for lunch at the historic **Astoria Shish Kebob House**\, one of th
 e most well-known Greek restaurants in the city.\n\nExpect:\nClassic souvl
 aki\nLemon potatoes\nFresh Greek salad\nBig\, generous comfort food energy
 \nMenu: Click Here!\nNothing bonds people like sharing a table and passing
  the tzatziki.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‍♂️ What to Expect\nWe’ll walk at a
  relaxed\, social pace — stopping to observe\, chat\, and enjoy the neig
 hbourhood. The route will take us toward Danforth & Chester.\nYou’re wel
