DESCRIPTION:Try New Things in Toronto!\n# 🚊✨ FIRST RIDE: The Eglinton
  Crosstown Adventure + Brunch! 🥂🥞\n\nWe’ve waited YEARS for this m
 oment… and now it’s finally here.\nSo let’s do something a little di
 fferent. A little unique. A little “only our group would do this.” 
 😄\n\nWe’re riding the **first stretch of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT**
  from **Kennedy Station to Eglinton Station** — about a 40-minute ride (
 fingers crossed 🤞). And we’re not rushing. We’re not commuting. We
 ’re not stressed about missing our stop.\n\nWe’re just… riding. 🚊
 💛\n\nSitting back. Taking it all in. Watching the city glide by. Chatti
 ng. Laughing. People-watching. Experiencing a brand-new piece of Toronto h
 istory together.\n\nBecause honestly? There’s something kind of magical 
 about riding transit with no agenda — just connection and curiosity.\nAn
 d when we arrive?\n\nWe reward ourselves with **brunch at The Pickle Barre
 l**. 🍳🥓☕\n\n👉 **Pickle Barrel** **Menu:** [Click Here!](https:/

 njoy one of Toronto’s most beautiful parks together. 💙\n**High Park**
  is the city’s largest public park — full of winding trails\, little h
 ills (yes\, there are a few! 😄)\, open green space\, squirrels plotting
  world domination 🐿️\, a mini zoo\, lakefront views\, and some of the
  prettiest natural scenery in the city.\nThis isn’t a power hike.\nThis 
 isn’t a marathon.\nThis is a **fun\, light\, social winter wander** — 
 about an hour of walking\, chatting\, laughing\, and just being outside to
 gether. 🌬️👟\nAnd then?\nWe warm up at the **Grenadier Café**\, ri
 ght in the heart of the park\, for a cozy lunch. ☕🍔🍟 Nothing hits 
 quite like a warm meal after a brisk walk.\nFresh air + good conversation 
 + comfort food.\nThat’s the vibe. ✨\n\n***\n\n📱 **Don’t forget to
