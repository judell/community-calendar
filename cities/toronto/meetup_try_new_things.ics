 ANCAKES on Pancake Tuesday (Shrove Tuesday)**? 🥞✨\n\nThis delicious t
 radition happens the night before Lent — a time when\, historically\, pe
 ople used up all the *butter\, sugar\, and sweet things* before giving som
 ething up for 40 days. (You do **not** have to be Catholic — it’s just
  a fun tradition I grew up with… and honestly\, pancakes are reason enou
 gh.)\n\nIt’s a weeknight\, it’s cozy\, it’s social\, and it’s the 
 perfect excuse to gather\, laugh\, and make new friends over a plate of fl
 uffy goodness. 🧈🍯\n\n👉 **Please note:** You don’t *have* to ord
 er pancakes…\n…but it’s **highly encouraged** 😉🥞\n👉 **Don

 taurant: **Kos Restaurant – Kensington Market**\nKos is one of the **old
 est and most beloved restaurants in Kensington Market** and one of Toronto
 ’s top brunch spots. Weekend wait times can reach **an hour or more**\, 
 which tells you everything you need to know.\n\nThey’re famous for:\n
 🥞 Golden\, fluffy pancakes\n🍳 All-day breakfast\n🌟 Fresh\, made-t
 o-order comfort food\n**Menu:** [Click Here!](https://www.kosrestaurant.ca
 /menu)\n\n⚠️ **PLEASE NOTE:**\nThis is a small diner\, and we may be s
 eated at **multiple tables** — but we’ll still be eating pancakes toge
 ther in spirit. 🥞💛\n\\*\\*\\*\n🧢 How to Find Me\nI’ll be outsid
 e the restaurant wearing my **Moose Hat** 🫎🎩\n❗ **PLEASE DO NOT GO
  INSIDE WITHOUT ME** — I’ll only wait **5 minutes** outside.\n🚫 **P

 fingers crossed 🤞). And we’re not rushing. We’re not commuting. We
 ’re not stressed about missing our stop.\n\nWe’re just… riding. 🚊

 ng. Laughing. People-watching. Experiencing a brand-new piece of Toronto h
 istory together.\n\nBecause honestly? There’s something kind of magical 
 about riding transit with no agenda — just connection and curiosity.\nAn
