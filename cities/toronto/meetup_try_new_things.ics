 😄\n\nWe’re riding the **first stretch of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT**
  from **Kennedy Station to Eglinton Station** — about a 40-minute ride (
 fingers crossed 🤞). And we’re not rushing. We’re not commuting. We
 ’re not stressed about missing our stop.\n\nWe’re just… riding. 🚊
 💛\n\nSitting back. Taking it all in. Watching the city glide by. Chatti
 ng. Laughing. People-watching. Experiencing a brand-new piece of Toronto h
 istory together.\n\nBecause honestly? There’s something kind of magical 
 about riding transit with no agenda — just connection and curiosity.\nAn
