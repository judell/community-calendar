SUMMARY:We by Yevgeny Zamyatin
DESCRIPTION:Post-Apocalyptic Book Club - Toronto Chapter\nOur next book wi
 ll be We by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Here's the blurb:\n\nThe exhilarating dystop
 ian novel that inspired George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadowed the worst ex
 cesses of Soviet Russia.\n\nYevgeny Zamyatin's *We* is a powerfully invent
 ive vision that has influenced writers from George Orwell to Ayn Rand. In 
 a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines\, ruled over by the all-p
 owerful 'Benefactor'\, the citizens of the totalitarian society of OneStat
 e live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503\, a mathem
 atician who dreams in numbers\, makes a discovery: he has an individual so
 ul. Set in the twenty-sixth century AD\, *We* is the classic dystopian nov
 el and was the forerunner of works such as George Orwell's *1984* and Aldo
 us Huxley's *Brave New World*. It was suppressed for many years in Russia 
 and remains a resounding cry for individual freedom\, yet is also a powerf
 ul\, exciting and vivid work of science fiction.\n\nNote for this book - t
 here are a large variety of versions and translations!\nThe book is availa
 ble here:\n\nAmazon- Paperback\, eBook\, Audiobook:\nhttps://www.amazon.ca
