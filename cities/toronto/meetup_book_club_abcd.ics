SUMMARY:ABCD Reads "Heart the Lover" by Lily King
DESCRIPTION:A Book Club\, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads "**Heart the Lover**
 " by Lily King.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/6289524441481216
 ) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n"For its first 
 half...a wry\, witty\, exquisitely evocative campus tale\, a fevered ficti
 on of a youthful love triangle\, and a reflection\,...on the growth and de
 velopment of a writer. By the end\, it stands as one of the most emotional
 ly devastating and soulfully wise novels I have ever read ... Literary wit
 hout pretension\, emotional without maudlin sentimentality. It must be sai
 d\, however\, that King skirts perilously close to the latter in Part 3\, 
 and it is a tribute to the power of her moral vision\, the precision of he
 r prose\, and her animating empathy that the novel avoids bathos and pulls
  off these wild swerves convincingly ... Heartrending\, swoonily romantic\
 , rigorously clear-sighted." (from [The Boston Globe](https://www.bostongl
 obe.com/2025/09/23/arts/lily-king-heart-the-lover/))\n\n"Our narrator unde
 rstands good love stories—their secrets and subtext\, their highs and th
 eir free falls. But her greatest love story\, the one she lived\, never fo
 llowed the simple rules.\nIn the fall of her senior year of college\, she 
 meets two star students from her 17th-Century Lit class: Sam and Yash. Bes
 t friends living off-campus in the elegant house of a professor on sabbati
 cal\, the boys invite her into their intoxicating world of academic fervor
 \, rapid-fire banter and raucous card games. They nickname her Jordan\, an
 d she quickly discovers the pleasures of friendship\, love and her own int
 ellectual ambition. Youthful passion is unpredictable though\, and she soo
 n finds herself at the center of a charged and intricate triangle. As grad
 uation comes and goes\, choices made will alter these three lives forever.
 \nDecades later\, Jordan is living the life she dreamed of\, and the vulne
 rable days of her youth seem comfortably behind her. But when a surprise v
 isit and unexpected news brings the past crashing into the present\, Jorda
 n returns to a world she left behind and is forced to confront the decisio
 ns and deceptions of her younger self.\nWritten with the superb wit and em
 otional sensitivity fans and critics of Lily King have come to adore\, *He
 art the Lover* is a deeply moving story that celebrates love\, friendship\
 , and the transformative nature of forgiveness. Wise\, unforgettable\, and
  with a delightful connective thread to *Writers & Lovers*\, this is King 
 at her very best\, affirming her as a masterful chronicler of the human ex
 perience and one of the finest novelists at work today." (from [Goodreads]

SUMMARY:ABCD Reads "Interpreter of Maladies" by Jhumpa Lahiri
DESCRIPTION:A Book Club\, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads "**Interpreter of Ma
 ladies**" by Jhumpa Lahiri\, a short story collection that won the Pulitze
 r Prize for Fiction in 2000.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/516
 5914897252352) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n"N
 avigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling
  new world\, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant\, touching stories 
 seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In "A Temporary 
 Matter\," published in The New Yorker\, a young Indian-American couple fac
 es the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood cop
 es with a nightly blackout. In the title story\, an interpreter guides an 
 American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonish
 ing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of An
 ita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant." (from [Goodread
 s](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies))\n\n"
 With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence\, Jhumpa Lahiri traces th
 e crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants\, expatriates\, and their ch
 ildren arrive\, quite literally\, at a cultural divide.\nA blackout forces
  a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tat
 tered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural iden
 tity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakastani civil war rages on
  television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother
  finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta. In the title story\, an interp
 reter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and h
 ears an astonishing confession.\nImbued with the sensual details of Indian
  culture\, these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has
  ever felt like a foreigner. Like the interpreter of the title story\, Lah
 iri translates between the strict traditions of her ancestors and a baffli
 ng new world." (from the [Toronto Public Library](https://tpl.bibliocommon
