  Olenska returns to New York after a disastrous marriage\, Archer falls de
 eply in love with her. Torn between duty and passion\, Archer struggles to

SUMMARY:ABCD Reads "Interpreter of Maladies" by Jhumpa Lahiri
DESCRIPTION:A Book Club\, Downtown (ABCD)\nABCD Reads "**Interpreter of Ma
 ladies**" by Jhumpa Lahiri\, a short story collection that won the Pulitze
 r Prize for Fiction in 2000.\n\n[[RESULTS](https://opavote.com/results/516
 5914897252352) of the poll for this event]\n\n**:: ABOUT THE BOOK ::**\n"N
 avigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling
  new world\, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant\, touching stories 
 seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In "A Temporary 
 Matter\," published in The New Yorker\, a young Indian-American couple fac
 es the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood cop
 es with a nightly blackout. In the title story\, an interpreter guides an 
 American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonish
 ing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of An
 ita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant." (from [Goodread
 s](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies))\n\n"
 With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence\, Jhumpa Lahiri traces th
 e crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants\, expatriates\, and their ch
 ildren arrive\, quite literally\, at a cultural divide.\nA blackout forces
  a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tat
 tered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural iden
 tity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakastani civil war rages on
  television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother
  finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta. In the title story\, an interp
 reter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and h
 ears an astonishing confession.\nImbued with the sensual details of Indian
  culture\, these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has
  ever felt like a foreigner. Like the interpreter of the title story\, Lah
 iri translates between the strict traditions of her ancestors and a baffli
 ng new world." (from the [Toronto Public Library](https://tpl.bibliocommon
