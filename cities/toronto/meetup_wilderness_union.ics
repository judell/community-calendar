 n***Join us as we explore this seemingly untouched wilderness known to jus
 t a few.***\n\nThis hike is a genuine adventure\, taking us to a spot wher
 e trails appear out of nowhere then disappear again as soon as you find th
 em. While only 9km\, this is a harder hike that will see us bushwhacking t
 hrough dense forest\, hopping over myriad streams and potentially trudging
  through thick snow.\n\nThe reward is incredible however - we end up traci
 ng a raging river along an impossibly pretty shoreline and past some feroc
 ious rapids. If you've been itching for something a bit more challenging\,
  this is your chance.\n\nOn this hike you can expect:\n\\- Trekking along 
 icy rivers\n\\- Sprawling frozen scenery\n\\- Raging rapids\n\\- An epic f
 eat of engineering\n\n***A note for self-drivers: parking can be precariou
 s here\, especially with heavy snowfall. You are strongly encouraged to ta
 ke WU transport to avoid issues.***\n\n***Snowshoes are included in the co
 st of this adventure. Please indicate at checkout if you require a pair.**
