SUMMARY: Moridja Kitenge Banza: Chiromancie-hors-série-4 n1 & n2
DESCRIPTION:Chiromancie is a series of paintings in which the hand become
 s a sensitive map\, a living territory marked by lines of fate\, the invi
 sible borders of history\, and the imprints of memory. By diverting the t
 radition of palmistry\, these works reframe the hand as a political site:
  a place of labour\, oppression\, transmission\, resistance and exploitat
 ion. Each painted palm evokes both personal narratives and the broader ge
 opolitical issues tied to displaced bodies\, erased knowledge\, fragmente
 d lands\, and extracted resources.\n\nThe presence of forms reminiscent o
 f aerial views of open-pit mines anchors the series in a reflection on re
 source extraction\, particularly mining\, and the dependencies it generat
 es between the Global North and South. Chiromancie thus becomes a poetic 
 device for exploring the tensions between individual identity and collect
 ive history\, between intimate gestures and grand historical narratives.\
 n\nChiromancie-hors-série-4-n1 / Chiromancie-hors-série-4-n2 are new en
 tries into Moridja Kitenge Banza https://www.moridjakitenge.com/ ’s Chiro
 mancie series\, developed in response to the production Copperbelt https:
 //www.soulpepper.ca/performances/copperbelt .\n\nOn view in the Soulpeppe

SUMMARY: Are We Cooked? A Casual Conversation on the General State of Aff
 airs
DESCRIPTION:In a time of overlapping crises\, when the phrases like ‘unpr
 ecedented’ and ‘now more than ever’ pepper the popular lexicon to the poi
 nt of incoherence\, we are called to ask: is there a reason to have hope?
  Should we do our best with what we have or burn it all down and start ov
 er? Are we capable of change? If we stay the course\, what future are we 
 heading to?\n\nThese questions\, contended with in the production Witch h
 ttps://www.soulpepper.ca/performances/witch \, will be examined by truste
 d thinkers Amil Niazi\, Niko Stratis\, Tantoo Cardinal and moderator Elam
 in Abdelmahmoud on Saturday February 21 at Soulpepper Theatre\, prior to 
 the evening performance.\n\nFree and open to all. Registration encouraged
