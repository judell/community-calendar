SUMMARY: bentway after school - for curious and creative community explor
 ers\, ages 9-14
DESCRIPTION:If you're looking for a creative\, after-school\, winter prog
 ram in downtown Toronto\, check out the "Bentway after school".\n\nThe Be
 ntway invites young urbanists to explore and learn about their city with 
 lots of fun\, creativity\, and outdoor discovery along the way. The progr
 am empowers participants to understand and influence concepts in urban de
 sign\, city building\, and placemaking through neighbourhood investigatio
 ns\, storytelling\, and recreation.\n\nThere are two 5-week session optio
 ns\, January 6 to February 3 and February 10 to March 10. Join for one or
  both sessions! The cost of each session is $175.00 per participant.\n  *
  The program is for youth ages 9-14 (grades 4-8).\n  * All materials will
  be provided.\n  * The first week of the program sessions (January 6 and 
 February 10) feature ice skating at The Bentway’s iconic\, figure-8 skate
  trail! Skate rentals and equipment are included.\n  * The Programming is
  held across The Bentway sites\, including indoor and outdoor activities 
 and walking tours.\n  * Please ensure your student is dressed for the ele
 ments and is wearing appropriate footwear.\n  * Accessible and all-gender

 -sensitive facility. For the safety of all our participants and staff\, p
 lease do not send any snack items which may contain peanuts\, nuts and al
 l other nut products.\n  * A Participant Intake Packet will be sent follo
 wing online registration.\n\nThe program will go beyond being “hands-on” 
 — it will also be “minds-on.” During each session\, young urbanists will 
 ask questions\, gather information\, compare and collaborate\, draw concl
 usions\, and develop a point of view on city building and placemaking.\n\
 nInteractive experiences including site tours\, outdoor recreation\, and 
 hands-on arts and design challenges shaped in collaboration with youth ed
 ucation leaders Maximum City\, will encourage participants to not only ex
 plore The Bentway\, but critically examine the Gardiner Expressway’s hist
 ory\, current state\, and potential future through skill building in mult
 idisciplinary fields.\n\nGuided by principles of Indigenous place keeping
 \, ecology\, storytelling\, adaptation\, and youth agency\, the program e
 mpowers youth to ask critical questions and imagine what cities can becom
 e when everyone gets a say in how they’re built.\n\nWorking independently
  and collaboratively\, participants will earn badges in a custom “City Pa
 ssport\,” build foundational skills across a variety of disciplines\, and
  ultimately co-create a public experience that captures and communicates 
 their vision for the future city.\n\nFor more information\, contact rcast
