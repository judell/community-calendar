SUMMARY:Engineering Study Break
DESCRIPTION:Winter Study Break: February 16 – 22\, 2026 \nNo classes will take place during the Study Break week. In Engineering courses\, no assessments may be scheduled nor assignments due between Monday and the following Sunday of the study break week\, inclusive of those dates. This does not prevent the Faculty from scheduling deferred exams during the break. Accommodations made by an instructor to an individual student as a result of a term-work petition or from accessibility services are also allowed during these days. \nFor the complete list of sessional dates\, visit the Engineering Academic Calendar.

SUMMARY:2026 Fred Kan Distinguished Lecture in Engineering Ethics
DESCRIPTION:Promoting ethical engineering research is necessary given the potential for widespread social and technological impacts of these research outcomes. But what motivates engineers to think and act ethically\, particularly in the domain of research?   \nIn this interactive talk\, Dr. Justin L. Hess will address this question by sharing types of critical incidents experienced by engineering faculty who conduct biomedical engineering research. The incident types denote the formative impacts of professional culture and academic norms\, engaging in ethical behaviors\, observing questionable behaviors\, attending to novel perspectives\, formal and informal training and mentoring events\, and reflecting on one’s own views and experiences. By understanding what experiences inspire engineers to think and act ethically\, institutions of higher education and engineering organizations will be better positioned to support ethical growth be it in formal courses\, faculty research labs\, organizational training efforts\, or by reshaping institutional norms. Cost: Free\nLimited alumni tickets available.   \nRegister now\nRegister by March 2\, 2026.

SUMMARY:Robotics Institute Seminar: Sergey Stavisky\, “A multi-modal brain-computer interface for restoring lost communication”
DESCRIPTION:A multi-modal brain-computer interface for restoring lost communication \nJoin in-person in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nRestoring the ability to communicate to people with neurological injuries has long been a goal of neurotechnology research; today\, this dream is on the verge of fruition with ongoing commercial cursor and click brain-computer interface (BCI) clinical trials. I will describe our lab’s development of an intracortical speech BCI\, which is the next frontier in restoring communication. First\, we built a 99% word accuracy “brain-to-text” speech BCI. To this core capability\, we’ve added neural cursor control over the participant’s personal computer (despite recording from orofacial cortex). We’ve also augmented text decoding with a loudness layer and a gesture (emoji) layer\, both of which provide added expressivity\, and we prototyped a neural error decoder which can reduce user frustration. Lastly\, I’ll describe our progress towards an instantaneous voice synthesis BCI aimed at functionally replacing the paralyzed vocal system. \nSpeaker bio \n\nI’m a neuroscientist and neural engineer working at the intersection of systems and computational neuroscience\, neural engineering\, and machine learning. I’m trying to understand how the brain controls movements\, and to use this knowledge to build brain-computer interface (BCIs) that treat brain injury and disease. My immediate goals are to develop BCIs for restoring speech. Closely related\, I’m developing next-generation neural interfaces for human use. \nAs an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California\, Davis\, I co-direct the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab . Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Stanford Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory led by Jaimie Henderson and Krishna Shenoy.

SUMMARY:Robotics Institute Seminar: Risto Ojala\, “Perception solutions for enabling automated driving in winter conditions”
DESCRIPTION:Perception solutions for enabling automated driving in winter conditions \nJoin in MY580 or online (Zoom) \nThis talk presents methods and findings from research on perception solutions for automated driving in winter conditions\, carried out at the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory\, Aalto University. Winter conditions pose several challenges for automated vehicle perception pipelines\, which currently limit the applicability of the technology in adverse weather conditions. The talk focuses on two main research directions: denoising snowflakes from LiDAR data and road segmentation in snowy conditions. Airborne snowflakes introduce significant noise into LiDAR scans\, which can hinder downstream perception tasks. To address this challenge\, the talk presents deep learning approaches for point cloud denoising based on both supervised and self-supervised learning. In addition\, snowy conditions drastically alter the visual appearance of the environment and the road\, rendering road segmentation methods trained on traditional datasets unreliable. To overcome this\, trajectory-based approaches leveraging vision foundation models are presented for learning varied road appearance without requiring manual labeling. \nSpeaker bio \nRisto Ojala (DSc\, Tech) is an Assistant Professor at Aalto University\, Finland\, where he leads the Autonomy & Mobility Laboratory within the Mechatronics research group. His research focuses on intelligent vehicles and mobile robotics\, with particular emphasis on perception\, sensor fusion\, and applied machine learning for autonomous systems. He is also currently a Visiting Scholar at Simon Fraser University\, Canada\, collaborating with the Multi-Agent Robotic Systems Laboratory on research in semantic understanding for mobile robotics. His work develops perception solutions that enable robust autonomous operation in challenging environments. A central application of his research is automated driving in winter conditions\, addressing problems such as scene understanding\, situational awareness\, and perception reliability. His work has been published in leading robotics and intelligent transportation venues and he collaborates closely with both academic and industrial partners.
