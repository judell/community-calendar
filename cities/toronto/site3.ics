SUMMARY:Fundamentals of Leatherworking
DESCRIPTION:This 5 hour workshop will teach you the critical skills required to create your own high-quality leather projects. Open to all skill levels.\n\n\nIf you’ve never tried your hand at leatherworking\, or if you are looking to take your existing  skills to the next level\, instructor Jacob Johnson will guide you through the many details and techniques you’ll want to know in order to get a solid foundation with your journey into this timeless craft. \n\n\n\nOver the course of 5 hours\, this deep-dive will train you in all of the core skills required to create nearly any leatherworking project. By the end\, you will have created your very own fully customized leather keychain using top quality materials and high-end techniques. Not only will you take home a piece to be proud of\, but you will leave with the confidence and knowledge on exactly how to get started on your next project! \n\n\n\nInstructor Jacob will provide demonstrations\, explain different types of leather\, materials and how to use the tools of the trade. Together you will explore a variety of different techniques with one-on-one guidance and answers to any questions you may have along the way. \n \nYour class project will be created from top-grain\, hand dyed\, vegetable tanned leather (vegan options are available upon request). You will get to customize each part of your project by choosing your thread\, hardware and leather colour\, as well as learning how to use a wide range of detailing stamps in order to truly personalize your one of a kind keychain. When properly built and cared for\, leather goods can last decades and will develop the beautiful patina that only high-quality leather goods can achieve. \nThere will be a fair amount of hands on hammering\, cutting\, sanding\, polishing and a technique called saddle-stitching (where you sew using two blunted needles at once). Site3 will provide all tools and materials\, but it is recommended to bring some kind of lunch/snack and hydration. There will be a half-hour break at the mid-point of the class. \n\n\n\nIf you’re curious about Site 3 Co-Laboratory please stop by for our weekly Open House every Thursday evening\, more info at www.site3.ca \n \nPARTICIPANTS MUST BE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. \nIF YOU REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS\, CONTACT INFO@SITE3.CA BEFORE PURCHASING YOUR TICKET.
