DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The emergence of galaxies in the first billion yea
 rs: implications for reionization\, cosmology and gravitational wave astron
 omy</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Galaxy formation in the first billion years mar
 ks a time of great upheaval in our cosmic history: the first sources of lig
 ht in the Universe\, these galaxies ended the 'cosmic dark ages' and produc
 ed the first photons that could break apart the hydrogen atoms suffusing al
 l of space starting the process of 'cosmic reionization'. The past few year
 s have seen cutting-edge instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope
  (JWST) provide tantalising glimpses of such galaxies assembling in an infa
 nt Universe. Puzzlingly\, these observations are also yielding a sample of 
 unexpectedly numerous and large black holes (up to a 100 million solar mass
 es) within the first 600 million years\, posing an enormous challenge for g
 alaxy formation models. I will show how this data is providing an unprecede
 nted opportunity to pin down the reionization state of the Universe in addi
 tion to providing an unrivalled resource for understanding the reionization
  topology in the forthcoming era of 21cm cosmology. I will also show how th
 ese early systems provide a powerful testbed for Dark Matter models beyond 
 "Cold Dark Matter". Finally\, I will try to give a flavour of the gravitati
 onal wave event rates expected from such early black holes in the Laser Int
 erferometer Space Antenna Array (LISA) era.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Bart Ripperda<

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Cosmology from weak lensing surveys: from Stage-II
 I to Stage-IV</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: As we come to an end of analyzing the
  Stage-III weak lensing surveys\, we have reached a milestone of statistica
 l power in our datasets -- we are covering thousands of square degrees of s
 ky and measuring shapes of hundreds of millions of galaxies\; we are placin
 g constraints on cosmological parameters at a similar level as that from th
 e CMB. But standing at where we are\, it seems a little different from what
  we imagined 5 years ago -- we also seeing a number of previously ignored e
 ffects become important\, as well as mild disagreements between different c
 osmology probes. In this talk I describe 3 directions that we could make pr
 ogress in the continuous battle of pushing down the statistical and systema

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Core Collapse Supernovae: Black Holes and Neutrino
 s</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae are some of the most exp
 losive high-energy astrophysical events in our universe. They are the resul
 t of the collapse of the iron core in an evolved massive star (M > 8-10 sol
 ar masses).  The collapse is halted when the collapsing core reaches nuclea
 r densities\, at which point the core-collapse supernova central engine tak
 es over. We know that the central engine must eventually drive an explosion
  in some fraction of massive stars\, however\, after over 40 years of theor
 etical research we still do not completely understand this core-collapse su
 pernova mechanism.  In this talk\, I will review the state of core-collapse
  supernova theory.  I will also discuss our work at Caltech on both the suc
 cess and failure of the core-collapse supernova mechanism.  For looking at 
 the success\, we considered the possibility that collective neutrino oscill
 ations may enhance the neutrino mechanism.  If a core-collapse supernova fa
 ils\, a black hole is the result.  I will discuss our predictions for black
  hole populations from failed supernova.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Francois Foucart<

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Massive gravitons and enhanced gravitational lensi
 ng</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: low mass degrees of freedom in gravity are stric
 tly limited by observations within the solar system. A compelling way to re
 solve this apparent contradiction is to add a galilean-invariant scalar fie
 ld to gravity. Called galileons\, these scalars have strong self interactio
 ns near overdensities\, like the solar system\, that suppress their effects
  on the motion of massive particles. These non-linearities are weak on cosm
 ological scales\, permitting new physics to operate. Extending galilean inv
 ariance to the coupling of galileons to stress-energy -- as was first done 
 in the case of massive gravity -- can have a surprising phenomenological co
 nsequence: enhanced gravitational lensing. Weak lensing observations will b
 e able to detect or constrain out this effect\, which is not well described
  by existing "model independent" tests of GR. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Neal Dalal<

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Probing the Universe’s expansion with multi-messen
 ger astronomy</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Thanks to the synergies between gravi
 tational wave (GW) experiments\, such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA\, and electromagn
 etic observations of transients and galaxies\, a variety of novel cosmologi
 cal measurements has recently become possible. Several of these measurement
 s rely on the use of GW events as "standard sirens”. Following the detectio
 n of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a GW event\, GW170817\, the f
 irst “bright” standard siren measurement has been performed. We continue se
 arching for optical counterparts to enable more bright siren analyses with 
 the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS)\, 
 which I will introduce. Standard siren measurements for “dark" events\, i.e
 . without a confirmed electromagnetic counterpart\, can also been performed
 \, using cross-correlations with galaxy or Active Galactic Nuclei catalogs.
  In this talk I will present our latest bright and dark standard siren meas
 urements\, and also provide forecasts for multi-messenger cosmology in the 
 upcoming years.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Large Influence of Small Tilts on Protoplaneta
 ry Disks in Binary Star Systems</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: ALMA has revealed a
 n overwhelming number of highly warped protoplanetary disks\, where the inn
 er disk lies on an orbital plane highly misaligned to the outer disk.  Howe
 ver\, a prediction of tilted protoplanetary disk theories is even small mis
 alignments can have a significant impact on the long-term inclination evolu
 tion of the disk.  In this talk\, we will go over the prediction and observ
 ational validation of theories regarding small tilts of protoplanetary disk
 s in binary star systems.  We will discuss why a protoplanetary disk orbiti
 ng two stars on an eccentric orbit can sometimes have its inclination grow 
 to a 90 degree angle with the binary orbital plane\, and the protoplanetary
  disks observed to lie in this “polar-aligned” state.  We will examine how 
 the gravitational torque on a protoplanetary disk from a binary companion c
 an cause a planet to form around a backwards-spinning star\, and how the sp
 in directions of stars within numerous exoplanetary systems can be explaine
 d by this “disk torquing” mechanism.  We will also discuss work on oddball 
 protoplanetary disks\, such as KH 15D\, and ongoing observational efforts t
 o further test the robustness of theories involving tilted protoplanetary d
 isks in binary star systems.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Antoine Marchal</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Twist and shout: gravitomagnetic tidal resonances 
 in binary inspirals</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I know\, the second part of the
  title sounds intimidating. Perhaps you're already thinking: this talk is n
 ot for me. But resist and come anyway! I promise that I will make the subje
 ct accessible to all\, and that the physics is actually pretty exciting. Wh
 at is it about? The context for the talk comes from the ongoing effort to m
 easure gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries\, and to use th
 ese observations to learn something about the intimate nature of black hole
 s and neutron stars. Black holes have no internal structure and are therefo
 re boring\, but neutron stars are deeply mysterious\, featuring matter at d
 ensities that far exceed what can be found in ordinary nuclear matter in la
 boratories. A key to an understanding of their interior comes from the tida
 l deformation of each neutron star when the binary system is approaching me
 rger\, and its imprint on the emitted gravitational waves. I shall describe
  a less familiar type of tidal field predicted by general relativity\, asso
 ciated with the gravity produced by mass currents (gravitomagnetism). I wil
 l show how this tidal field can excite modes of vibration of a rotating neu
 tron star (inertial modes) and produce resonances. The resonances have a la
 rge impact on the binary's orbital motion\, and this can be measured in the
  emitted gravitational waves\, giving us a new handle on the intimate natur
 e of neutron stars.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Phil Landry</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Radiative Efficiency of Accretion Flows in Ind
 ividual Active Galactic Nuclei </b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The radiative effic
 iency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) is commonly estimated based on the t
 otal mass accreted and the total AGN light emitted per unit volume in the u
 niverse integrated over time (the Soltan argument). In individual AGNs\, th
 in accretion disk model spectral fits can be used to deduce the absolute ac
 cretion rate Mdot\, if the black hole mass M is known. The radiative effici
 ency η is then set by the ratio of the bolometric luminosity L bol to Mdot 
 c2. We apply this method to determine η in a sample of 80 Palomar-Green qua
 sars with well-determined L_bol\, where Mdot is set by thin accretion disk 
 model fits to the optical luminosity density\, and the M determination base
 d on the bulge stellar velocity dispersion (13 objects) or the broad line r
 egion. We derive a mean log η = -1.05 ± 0.52 consistent with the Soltan-arg
 ument-based estimates. We find a strong correlation of η with M\, rising fr
 om η ~ 0.03 at M = 107 M sun and L/L_Edd ~ 1 to η ~ 0.4 at M = 109 M sun an
 d L/L_Edd ~ 0.3. This trend is related to the overall uniformity of L_opt/L
 _bol in our sample\, particularly the lack of the expected increase in L_op
 t/L_bol with increasing M (and decreasing L/L_Edd)\, which is a generic pro
 perty of thermal disk emission at fixed η. The significant uncertainty in t
 he M determination is not large enough to remove the correlation. The risin
 g η with M may imply a rise in the black hole spin with M\, as proposed bas
 ed on other indirect arguments. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Shane Davis</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Gravitational-wave propagation in arbitrary backgr
 ounds </b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The propagation of gravitational waves (GWs)
  probes the existence of exotic scalar waves predicted by extended models o
 f gravity designed to explain the nature of dark energy. In General Relativ
 ity and beyond\, linearized waves on top of a background metric are commonl
 y studied under one of two assumptions: either the background is fixed to a
  specific form\, or a well-behaved separation between wave and background m
 ust be imposed. This is traditionally done by requiring that the wavelength
  of the first is smaller than the typical length scale of the second. Howev
 er\, this naturally limits us to the geometric optics regime\, where the ra
 tio between the two is <<1\, and the energies involved are far higher than 
 the typical cosmological scales. In this somewhat technical but accessible 
 blackboard seminar\, I will introduce a new way to achieve this separation 
 for every GW wavelength. To better explain how this formalism can be used t
 o interpolate between low- and high-energy regimes\, I will expand on the d
 efinition and implications of a "well-behaved" separation of scales. Finall
 y\, I will conclude by presenting a simple application of this formalism to
  the propagation of scalar waves. Our results show for the first time that 
 interferometers on Earth cannot detect scalar waves for a wide class of ext
 ended models.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Antoine and Blackboard committee</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Dynamics and Afterglow Radiation of Gamma-Ray 
 Bursts</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts produce afterglow radiation
  as they drive strong relativistic shocks into the surrounding medium.  The
  explosion energy is beamed into narrow jets which initially do not spread 
 significantly due to relativistic kinematics.  As the shock decelerates\, l
 ateral spreading ensues and the blastwave slowly transitions into a spheric
 al non-relativistic shock.  I will discuss recent progress in understanding
  the dynamics of this process\, as well as the radiative signatures receive
 d by observers at arbitrary angles with respect to the jet axis.  I will th
 en discuss new relativistic MHD simulations of turbulent amplification of m
 agnetic field relevant for afterglow radiation as well as for neutron star 
 mergers.  If time permits\, I will also briefly discuss very recent work on
  low-mass protoplanet migration.  These topics are connected by recent deve
 lopments in numerical hydrodynamics including the use of dynamical computat
 ional meshes.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Shane Davis</b></p>

 tract: Extra (``fifth") forces generically follow from new dynamical fields
 \, and are therefore ubiqituous in extensions to the standard models of par

 tly strongly constrained by lab and Solar System tests as to be virtually i
 rrelevant for cosmology. However\, broad classes of Lagrangians exhibit ``s
 creening mechanisms" which hide the fifth force in high-density environment
 s such as the Milky Way while allowing it to remain operative on larger sca
 les. I will describe the search for screened fifth forces on the scale of g
 alaxies and their environments. This is achieved in two stages. First\, we 
 model the gravitational environments of the local ($z \\lesssim 0.05$) univ
 erse to determine the screening properties of real galaxies and the strengt
 h of the fifth-force field over space. Second\, we use this information to 
 forward-model two signals -- displacement between stellar and gas mass cent
 roids and warping of stellar disks -- and hence constrain the fifth-force s
 trength and range with a Bayesian likelihood formalism. Taking $\\sim$ 10\,
 000 HI detections from the ALFALFA survey and $\\sim$ 4\,000 images from th

 ~$1\\% that of gravity for ranges O(1-10 Mpc). Both signals give evidence f
 or a chameleon- or symmetron-screened fifth force of range ~1.8 Mpc and str

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Interferometric Mapping of Planetary Debris Disks 
 at (Sub)millimeter Wavelengths</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Circumstellar debris
  disks provide the principle window for investigating planet formation and 
 evolution on timescales of 10-100 Myr. Spatially resolved observations of t
 hese systems can directly probe exoplanets by matching density variations t
 o theoretical models of the gravitational perturbations caused by planets. 
 A modest sample of debris disks have now been imaged in the visible\, and m
 any show substructure such as clumps\, warps\, and offsets\, consistent wit
 h dynamical perturbations by massive planets. However\, a wide variety of o
 ther mechanisms can produce similar structures. As different wavebands are 
 sensitive to different grain sizes\, which are in turn subject to different
  dynamical influences\, multi-wavelength observations offer the most promis
 ing path towards definitively classifying the physical mechanisms at work i
 n these systems. Until recently\, only a few debris disks had resolved obse

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Tidal Effects in Double White Dwarf Binaries</b></
 p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs (DWD) in close orbits are t
 he most numerous and guaranteed gravitational wave (GW) sources for the nex
 t generation of space-based interferometers\, sensitive to low-frequency GW
 s (0.1 mHz - 1 Hz). Although the majority of them are expected to be circul
 ar\, theoretical calculations predict a population of detectable eccentric 
 DWDs. Here we investigate the potential for constraining the white dwarf (W
 D) properties through apsidal precession in these binaries. We analyze the 
 tidal\, rotational\, and general relativistic contributions to this process
  using detailed WD models. We find that apsidal precession in eccentric DWD
 s can be detectable for certain frequency regimes\, independently of the ag
 e of the WD components. More importantly we find that GW data analysis woul
 d suffer from extreme bias in the determination of the source masses if the
  different contributions to apsidal precession are not properly taken into 
 account. We are also able to identify a statistically unique relation among
  the WD properties that will allow to use apsidal precession as an addition
 al mass measurement tool.\n\nAn even “cleaner” source of apsidal precession
  are eccentric binaries hosting a neutron\nstar and a WD\, which are observ
 ed in the field typically as radio pulsars orbiting WDs.\nIn these sources\
 , apsidal precession carries the unique signature of the WD\, and could\npo
 tentially provide a testbed for validating the reliability of our WD models
 .\n\nBeyond apsidal precession\, where the effect of tides is non dissipati
 ve\, we investigate the impact of tidal dissipation on the orbital evolutio
 n of DWDs through dynamic\, nonadiabatic tides. To date\, the GW forms from
  these sources are based on the underlying assumption that the orbital evol
 ution of DWD is driven by GW emission alone calculated for point masses. Th
 eoretical calculations of tidally-driven orbital evolution timescales confi
 rm the validity of this approximation in the quasi-static tide limit (a low
 -frequency tidal forcing regime)\, where tidal energy is dissipated mainly 
 through convective damping operating near the WDs surface. Consequently\, a
 s GW emission causes the WDs to spiral in\, quasi-static tides will not be 
 able to catch up with GW driven orbital evolution and synchronize the WDs r
 otation with the orbital motion. Such binaries will naturally enter a high-
 frequency tidal forcing regime\, where the quasi-static tide approximation 
 breaks down. In this new limit\, energy dissipation through dynamic tides\,
  and resonances between the WDs eigenfrequencies and orbital frequency must
  be taken into account. For this purpose we are developing a code based on 
 the Riccati algorithm\, proven to be successful in the study of WD oscillat
 ions.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Snezana Prodan</b></p>

 \n\n(I). An anisotropy analysis of full-sky emission gamma-ray and radio ma
 ps is performed to identify possible signatures of annihilating dark matter
 . We calculate angular power spectra of the cosmological background of sync
 hrotron emission from dark matter annihilations into electron-positron pair
 s. We also develop a numerical tool to compute gamma-ray emission from such
  electrons and positrons diffusing in the smooth host halo and in substruct
 ure halos with masses down to earth mass. We show that\, unlike the total g
 amma-ray angular power spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT\, the angular power s
 pectrum from the inverse Compton scattering is exponentially suppressed bel
 ow an angular scale determined by the diffusion length of electrons and pos
 itrons. Together with contribution of prompt  gamma-ray emissions\,  there 
 exists a signature for dark matter and one can even get an estimate for the
  branching ratio.    \n\n(II). We use Gibbs sampling to generate a sampled 
 representation of the power spectrum posterior and the posterior of signal 
 maps given a set of measured visibilities of CMB signals in the uv-plane. G
 ibbs sampling is especially promising since it allows a full exploration of
  the joint posterior density of the power spectrum and signal reconstructio
 n in O(n log n) operations. This contrasts with the O(n^3) scaling for any 
 method that requires evaluations of the likelihood.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Rich

 mation on the location and the physical properties of\nthe event. \nWe iden
 tify two types of electromagnetic jets of similar power produces by merging
  BHs moving in a magnetic field supported by an external accretion disk: (i
 ) due to rotation\nof space-time within the orbit\; (ii) due to unipolar in
 duction mechanism.  In the latter case\, the magnetospheres of black holes 
  resemble in many respects  the magnetospheres\nof rotationally-powered pul
 sars\, with induced charge density\, pair formation fronts and  outer gaps\
 , where the sign of the  induced charge changes. As a result\,  a  black ho
 le\n moving linearly through magnetic field will generate bipolar electroma
 gnetic jets each consisting of  two counter-aligned current flows (four cur
 rent flows  total). The\n resulting Poynting power is  $ L \\approx {(G M)3
  B_02 /( c5 R) }$\,  where  $R$ is the radius of the orbit.  Since the resu
 lting electrodynamics is in many respects similar\nto pulsars\,  merging bl
 ack holes may generate coherent radio and high energy  emission beamed  app
 roximately along the orbital normal. In addition\,  merging BHs may produce
 \n observable wind-driven cavities. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>tba</b></p>

 ists have understood in the context of kinetic theory how ink slowly diffus
 es in a glass of water. The fluctuations of the stochastic forces acting on
  water molecules drive the diffusion of the ink in the fluid. This is the a
 rchetype of a process described by the so-called fluctuation-dissipation th
 eorem\, which universally relates the rate of diffusion to the power spectr
 um of the fluctuating forces. For stars in galaxies\, a similar process occ
 urs but with two significant differences\, due to the long-range nature of 
 the gravitational interaction: (i) for the diffusion to be effective\, star
 s need to resonate\, i.e. present commensurable frequencies\, otherwise the
 y only follow the orbit imposed by their mean field\; (ii) the amplitudes o
 f the induced fluctuating forces are significantly boosted by collective ef
 fects\, i.e. by the fact that\, because of self-gravity\, each star generat
 es a wake in its neighbours.\nIn the expanding universe\, an overdense pert
 urbation passing a critical threshold will collapse onto itself and\, throu
 gh violent relaxation and mergers\, rapidly converge towards a stationary\,
  phase-mixed and highly symmetric state\, with a partially frozen orbital s
 tructure. The object is then locked in a quasi-stationary state imposed by 
 its mean gravitational field. Of particular interests are strongly responsi
 ve colder systems which\, given time and kicks\, have the opportunity to si
 gnificantly reshuffle their orbital structure towards more likely configura
 tions. This presentation aims to explain this long-term reshuffling called 
 gravity-driven secular evolution on cosmic timescales\, described by extend
 ed kinetic theory. They offer unique physical insights into the competing d
 ynamical processes at play\, complementing N-body approaches. \nI will illu

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Role of the Ocean in climate change: the carbon st
 ory</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Oceans modulate changes in climate via their up
 take and storage of heat and carbon dioxide. The future behavior of the oce
 anic heat and carbon reservoirs is thus critically important for climate. \
 nA broad introduction to the changing carbon cycle will be followed by a di
 scussion of two basic questions:\n(1). How will ocean carbon storage respon
 d to ocean ventilation changes? What will be the resulting feedbacks on atm
 ospheric pCO2? Here I show based on model simulations in an ocean general c
 irculation model that increasing Southern Ocean winds - expected in a futur
 e warmer climate - act to decrease the carbon storage in the Southern Ocean
  and increase atmospheric pCO2.  \n(2)  How will ocean biology respond to c
 hanges in ocean physics induced by climate change? What will be the resulti
 ng feedback on atmospheric pCO2? I attempt to answer this question by analy
 zing results of 21st century climate simulations in a coupled Earth System 
 Model. I observe different physical\, biogeochemical and ecological behavio
 r in the Northern and Southern hemispheres\; this hemispheric asymmetry is 
 driven by different shifts in midlatitude westerlies and different changes 
 in stratification in the two hemispheres in a warmer climate. \n</p>\n<p>Ho

 es.  These concepts are then applied to the classic three- and four-body pr
 oblems in Newtonian gravity.  A statistical mechanics methodology is applie
 d in order to derive analytic expressions for the properties of the outcome
 s of these interactions.  This includes the orbital parameter distributions
  expected for populations of binary and triple star systems produced as a r
 esult of three- and four-body interactions.  Such small-number collisional 
 interactions occur regularly in star clusters throughout the Universe\, acr
 oss all mass scales.  At higher cluster masses\, such as globular and nucle
 ar star clusters\, stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are thought to be regular
  participants in these interactions.  This is a key step that influences di
 rectly the interpretation of observations of BH-BH mergers using gravitatio
 nal wave (GW) detectors\, such as aLIGO.  We discuss how the ever-growing n
 umber of observed BH-BH mergers can be used to constrain the astrophysical 
 environments from which the detected GWs originate.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Dan Ta

 (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas\, inc
 luding thin\, cool accretion disks and the interstellar medium of our galax
 y. However\, even the basic statistics of this type of turbulence remains u
 ncertain. In this talk I will present results from supersonic MHD turbulenc
 e simulations at unparalleled resolutions\, with plasma Reynolds numbers of
  over a million and grids up to 10080^3. In the kinetic energy spectrum we 
 find a break between the scales that are supersonic and dominated by kineti
 c energy\, with spectral index -2 (Burgers turbulence)\, and those that bec
 ome strongly magnetized and subsonic\, with spectral index -3/2. At magneti
 c Reynolds number of greater than 10^5\, we find a power law emerging in th
 e magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index -9/5\, unexplained by any mo
 dern\, asymptotic turbulence theory. On the strongly magnetized scales\, th
 e plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed states\, depleting the
  nonlinearities and highlighting that plasma relaxation is a fundamental fe
 ature of supersonic MHD turbulence. We coin the term competitive relaxation
  to describe the competition between the turbulent nonlinearities and the d
 epletion of these nonlinearities through relaxation. Both of these aspects 
 challenge profoundly the tenets of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence theories 
 and describe a new paradigm for supersonic turbulence.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Cla

  and clusters of galaxies and are possibly present throughout the Universe.
  However\, the origin of cosmic magnetic fields is a puzzle. An interesting
  possibility is that large-scale magnetic fields are of primordial origin\,
  formed in the early Universe. Such magnetic fields will alter the fluctuat
 ions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular\, intrinsicall

 magnetic CMB trispectrum and bispectrum. These non-Gaussian correlations co
 nstrain magnetic fields better than the CMB power spectrum.  Further\, the 
 trispectrum is found to be a more sensitive probe of magnetic fields than t
 he bispectrum. Using current observational limits on CMB non-Gaussianity\, 
 the strongest constraints emerge on cosmic magnetic fields. Thus\, the CMB 
 trispectrum is a new and powerful probe of primordial magnetism.\n</p>\n<p>

 y in differentially rotating fluids (like stars) even in the absence of a l
 arge scale magnetic field.  In an inhomogeneous system\, like a galaxy or a

 em with no initial large scale field.  It begins with an incoherent dynamo 
 and a magnetic helicity flux operating independently of any large scale fie
 ld and ends with a transition from linear growth to saturation due to turbu
 lent mixing. Applying this to the growth of large scale magnetic fields in 
 galactic disks we find that the time required to reach saturation is  a few

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Connecting Primordial Physics and Cosmological Obs
 ervations</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Inflation provides a compelling explanati
 on of the observed features of the universe on cosmological scales.  Yet\, 
 given the vast number of models\, it may not be clear what precisely these 
 observations tell us about the epoch of inflation.  In this colloquium\, I 
 will explain how we are bridging this gap\, both with a better understandin
 g of the theory and with new observational probes.  I will first review the
  historical motivations for inflation.  I will then discuss recent theoreti
 cal work which organizes the signatures of models according to basic proper
 ties\, like the number of degrees of freedom.  I will conclude by discussin
 g how this information is encoded in CMB and large scale structure data.</p

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Calibration of the Advanced LIGO Interferometers</
 b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Calibration is the critical link between the LIGO de
 tectors and the searches for gravitational-wave signals in LIGO data.  The 
 Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) calibration effort involves constructing the external
  strain incident on each LIGO detector from the digitized readout of the LI
 GO photodetectors.  The essential steps in calibration are the development 
 of accurate models of the LIGO detectors\, the digitization of these models
 \, and the application of the calibration models to construct the external 
 strain.  The aLIGO era has brought new complexities in accurately modeling 
 the LIGO detectors as well as the challenge of producing calibrated externa
 l strain in low-latency.  This talk will give an overview of the aLIGO cali
 bration procedure\, the low-latency pipeline currently in use\, and prelimi
 nary results for the uncertainty in the external strain construction during
  aLIGO’s first observing run.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Prayush Kumar</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>How we can probe magnetic fields over space and ti
 me -- and what we have found</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I briefly show example
 s of specialised hardware used since the 1960’s to image polarised synchrot
 ron radiation over several radio wavebands. Companion optical observations\
 , where possible\, can provide information on excitation\, nuclear and part
 icle species\, velocity structure\, and non-relativistic electron column de
 pths (Ne)\, for the magnetized regions which can produce Faraday rotation m
 easures (RM).  Similar companion information is provided by keV X-ray image
 s (e.g. ROSAT\, XMM\, Chandra) --and -- deflections of high energy cosmic r
 ays (VHECR\, UHECR). All of the above can be variously applied to probe and
  measure magnetic fields in supernova remnants\, pulsars\, local universe g
 alaxies\, the meta-Galaxy\, galaxy groups and clusters\, superclusters\, an
 d the wider intergalactic medium (IGM).  \nAs of now\, magnetic field estim
 ates exist for most galaxy types and systems\, all the way back to Recombin
 ation at redshift ~ 1500 -- then with less direct estimates back to the inf
 lation era\, near to the electroweak phase transition time. Near this point
 \, baryons\, leptons\, and other sub-atomic species are created. The enormo
 us matter densities here imply that photons will not directly penetrate the
  early cosmic soup\, and so familiar types of direct imaging will not be po
 ssible. But gravitational waves (GW) can propagate here\, and probably Alfv
 én–like waves (magnetic fields). This means that at such high densities\, g
 ravitational wave imaging may supersede the more familiar photon images of 
 the “visible” universe. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Viswesh Marthi</b></p>

 s are found in the wrong place and/or at the wrong time. Apparently young s
 tars\, so called blue stragglers\, are found in very old stellar clusters. 
 The environment near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center is
  very hostile to star formation\, yet newly formed stars are found very clo

 s\, yet young stars are observed in such environment too. Similarly superno

 should not exist. In my talk I will discuss such "existential" paradoxes of
  youth and suggest (mostly) dynamical solutions which can explain the origi
 n of such out of place/time stars. As I will show the solutions to these va
 rious puzzles could have important implications for our understanding of va

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Feedback-Regulated Universe</b></p>\n\n<p>Abst
 ract: Star formation proceeds in our Galaxy in a way that is not so easily 
 understood. Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) outweigh the most massive star cl
 usters by orders of magnitude - star formation is inefficient. The mass spe
 ctrum of young stars - the IMF - exhibits a remarkable degree of regularity
 \, across a wide range of conditions. Both facts suggest a certain degree o
 f self-regulation. Indeed\, both observations can be understood within the 
 same paradigm: the competition of stellar feedback versus gravity.\n \nGMCs
  are inherently 3-dimensional and highly substructured\, so analytic approa
 ches are limited and high-resolution\, multi-physics numerical hydrodynamic
 s simulations have proven to be the decisive laboratory for studying the se
 lf-regulation of star formation. I will review how numerical GMC simulation
 s have progressed over the past decade from very simplistic setups to a muc
 h more realistic\, physically-complete model with all feedback processes ac
 ting in concert: STARFORGE. This new generation of star formation models is
  able to account for the key hallmarks of star formation in our Galaxy\, an
 d this emboldens us to use them as an interpretive tool for observations\, 
 and make some interesting predictions for stellar populations in more exoti
 c environments.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marta Reina-Campos</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>SPIDER: Looking for CMB B-mode Polarization Behind
  the Galactic Screen</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Current cosmological data stro
 ngly favor a simple flat power-law LCDM model of the Universe. However\, th
 ere is no *direct* evidence to date for the cornerstone of this model: infl
 ation. Although the inflationary paradigm explains a wide range of physical
  observations\, alternatives\, such as the ekpyrotic scenario\, can do as m
 uch while avoiding some of the difficulties associated with building "natur
 al" models of inflation.  A unique prediction of inflation is the presence 
 of a primordial divergence-free polarization pattern ("B-modes") in the Cos
 mic Microwave Background (CMB).  SPIDER is a balloon-borne CMB polarization
  experiment designed to look for this signal and to either detect it or set
  stringent constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r which determines its
  amplitude.  I will present a status report on the SPIDER mission\, whose f
 irst flight is scheduled to take off from McMurdo\, Antarctica in December 
 2012\, with a heavy focus on the issue of polarized Galactic foregrounds.  
 In the SPIDER field\, and more generally over the entire sky accessible fro
 m a McMurdo long-duration balloon flight\, the polarized emission from inte
 rstellar dust is expected to be as bright or brighter than a r=0.03 B-mode 
 signal at all frequencies and angular scales of interest. I will present a 
 publicly available set of templates for this emission\, and confront it to 
 our theoretical and observational understanding of interstellar dust\, whic
 h constrains both its polarization amplitude and direction.</p>\n<p>Host: <

 weak lensing measurements and other observations such as redshift surveys\;

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>TeV blazar heating: impact of clustering</b></p>\n
 \n<p>Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM)  contains 90 % of the baryons
  of the Universe and is the reservoir for structure formation. Acting as a 
 calorimeter\, its thermal evolution traces the conditions for structure for
 mation and evolution. It was recently shown that TeV blazar heat up the IGM
  as the gamma-rays they produce turn into pairs which lose their kinetic en
 ergy to the surrounding medium through plasma instabilities. Assuming unifo
 rm heating\, TeV blazar heating increases the temperature of the IGM and pr
 oduces an inverted temperature-density relation in underdense regions. In t
 his talk I will review the main features of TeV blazar heating. Then\, I wi
 ll detail the method we recently developed to take into account heating flu
 ctuations due to clustering.  We find that blazar heating is more complex t
 han initially assumed. The resulting temperature-density relation presents 
 a wide scatter\, which is suggested by some recent Ly alpha observations.</

 used to analyse observations in astrophysics and cosmology\, but they can b
 e extremely computationally demanding. Recent work in this area by the Cave
 ndish Astrophysics Group has focussed on developing new methods for greatly
  accelerating such analyses\, by up to a factor a million\, using neural ne
 tworks and nested sampling methods\, such as the SkyNet and MultiNest packa
 ges respectively. These have recently been combined into the BAMBI algorith
 m\, which accelerates Bayesian inference still further. I will give an outl
 ine of these approaches\, which are generic in nature\, and illustrate thei
 r use in a cosmological case study.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Richard Shaw</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Thermal Stability and Vertical Structure of Radiat
 ion Dominated accretion Disks</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In the innermost regi
 ons of black hole and neutron star accretion flows\, the standard thin disk
  model implies that radiation pressure may exceed gas pressure\, and that t
 he resulting disks are thermally unstable. However\, in radiation magnetohy
 drodynamic simulations of disks with radiation treated via the flux-limited
  diffusion approximation\, recent work has found that accretion disks drive
 n by the\nmagnetorotational instability are stable even when radiation pres
 sure dominates.  We check this surprising result with our recently develope
 d radiation transfer module for the Athena code.  I will first describe our
  module and explain why its superior to commonly used prescriptions\, such 
 as flux limited diffusion.  Then I will summarize some test calculations th
 at demonstrate the code is working accurately. Finally\, I will describe in
  detail our work on the vertical structure and thermal stability of accreti
 on disks in both the gas pressure and radiation pressure dominated regimes.
  Although we confirm some conclusions of the previous work\, our results in
 dicate that radiation dominated disks are unstable after all.</p>\n<p>Host:

 he Formation of the Homunculus Nebula and Skirt\, and the Spin Evolution of

 ven winds from rotating stars\, and develop an approximate analytical model
 .  We then discuss the evolution of stellar angular momentum\, and show tha
 t just above the Eddington limit\, the winds are sufficiently concentrated 
 towards the poles to spin up the star. A twin-lobe structure of the ejected
  nebula is seen to be a generic consequence of critical rotation. We find t
 hat if the pressure in such stars is sufficiently dominated by radiation\, 
 an equatorial ejection of mass will occur during eruptions. These results a
 re then applied to eta-Carinae. We show that if it began its life with a hi
 gh enough angular momentum\, the present day wind could have driven the sta
 r towards critical rotation\, if it is the dominant mode of mass loss. \nWe
  find that the shape and size of the Homunculus nebula\, as given by our mo
 del\, agree with recent observations. Moreover\, the contraction expected d
 ue to the sudden increase in luminosity at the onset of the Great Eruption 
 explains the equatorial ``skirt" as well. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Ido</b></p>

   Today\, we have fantastic  images of the "spiral nebulae" Shapley wanted

  we believe to be  a "Bone" of the Milky Way\, tracing out the centroid of 
 a nearby piece of the Scutum-Centaurus arm.   I will also show how new stat

 discussion of how well\, or not well\, we really "know" the star formation 
 efficiency of the Milky Way.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Carlos Palenzuela</b></p>

 ract of 2112.11431:\nA major challenge for gravitational-wave (GW) detectio
 n in the μHz band is engineering a test mass (TM) with sufficiently low acc
 eleration noise. We propose a GW detection concept using asteroids located 
 in the inner Solar System as TMs. Our main purpose is to evaluate the accel
 eration noise of asteroids in the μHz band. We show that a wide variety of 
 environmental perturbations are small enough to enable an appropriate class
  of ∼10 km-diameter asteroids to be employed as TMs. This would allow a sen
 sitive GW detector in the band (few)×10−7Hz≲fGW≲(few)×10−5Hz\, reaching str
 ain hc∼10−19 around fGW∼10μHz\, sufficient to detect a wide variety of sour
 ces. To exploit these asteroid TMs\, human-engineered base stations could b
 e deployed on multiple asteroids\, each equipped with an electromagnetic tr
 ansmitter/receiver to permit measurement of variations in the distance betw
 een them. We discuss a potential conceptual design with two base stations\,
  each with a space-qualified optical atomic clock measuring the round-trip 
 electromagnetic pulse travel time via laser ranging. Tradespace exists to o
 ptimize multiple aspects of this mission: for example\, using a radio-rangi
 ng or interferometric link system instead of laser ranging. This motivates 
 future dedicated technical design study. This mission concept holds excepti
 onal promise for accessing this GW frequency band.</p>\n

 n exhibit very simple changes in the polarization direction as the stars ro
 tate.   This straightforward evolution with spin results from the first (ye

 induces an index of refraction: vacuum birefringence.   The observations of
  the prototypical X-ray pulsar Hercules X-1 reveal the interior of the neut

 J0440.9+4431 show  complexity of the emitting accretion flow can produce mo

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Astrophysical atomic structure - the state-of-the-
 art and uncharted territories</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: It is a matter of gre
 at theoretical and practical concern that as of 2015\, we only really know 
 the structure of the most basic atoms\, hydrogen and helium\, in intense ma
 gnetic fields such as those found in white dwarfs and neutron stars ($B > 1
 0^5 T$). These are the most highly magnetised objects in the observable uni
 verse. The energy levels\, transition wavelengths\, oscillator strengths an
 d electric and magnetic properties of virtually the entire periodic table i
 s almost completely unknown in such field strengths. Such atomic data is cr
 ucial for correctly interpreting the emergent spectra from magnetised compa
 ct objects\, particularly since evidence is now mounting for the presence o
 f atoms such as carbon being present in their atmospheres. In white dwarfs\
 , there are also other species such as phosphorus\, silicon and sulphur pre
 sent in appreciable quantities\, even in cooler and therefore older white d
 warfs. This is strange due to the very short timescales for the heavier ato
 ms to submerge in the atmospheres of white dwarfs. Thus\, the older the whi
 te dwarf\, the less the contaminants\, and the chemistry is expected to be 
 predominantly H or He. In neutron stars on the other the hand story is the 
 reverse\, only the younger neutron stars are expected to have H and He whic
 h are the remnants from supernova fallback material during collapse. The ol
 der neutron stars are expected to have purely heavier elements\; the produc
 ts of nuclear burning of lighter elements. Therefore it is now understood t
 hat the presence of low- and mid-Z elements such as carbon (and for that ma
 tter Si\, P\, S etc) in older varieties of both white dwarfs and neutron st
 ars is probably due to accretion of ambient material. In this talk I shall 
 summarize the state-of-the-art in the field of strong field atomic structur
 e field and also describe my recent efforts in developing fast atomic struc
 ture software that computes the energy landscape of low-Z atoms in intense 
 magnetic fields. </p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Migrating Embryo Model of Protostellar Disk Ev
 olution</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: \nI review our work that establishes a new 
 view of early protostellar disk evolution resulting from the self-consisten
 t collapse of a prestellar core. A burst mode of accretion begins upon the 
 formation of a centrifugally balanced disk around a newly formed protostar.
  It is comprised of prolonged quiescent periods of low accretion rate that 
 are punctuated by intense bursts of accretion that about three orders of ma
 gnitude greater\, and during which most of the protostellar mass is accumul
 ated. The accretion bursts are associated with the formation of dense proto
 stellar/protoplanetary embryos\, which are later driven onto the protostar 
 by the gravitational torques that occur in the disk.We conclude that most (
 if not all) protostars undergo a burst mode of evolution during their early
  accretion history. I review how the migrating embryo model leads to a unif
 ied picture of episodic \naccretion\, formation of companion stellar or sub
 stellar objects\, and even ejection events to make free-floating giant plan
 ets or  brown dwarfs. I also review how this paradigm is leading to new ins
 ights into thermal processing of solid materials in the early solar system 
 and the evolution of the first collapsed structures in the universe.</p>\n<

  could these black holes have formed? The two most promising pathways (hier
 archical galaxy mergers and accretion onto\ncollapsed Population III stars)
  have been ruled out by a number of recent  studies. A possible alternative
  pathway for supermassive black hole formation at high  redshifts is the co
 llapse of a supermassive star that may have formed in the direct collapse o
 f a primordial gas cloud. We self-consistently simulate the collapse of rap
 idly rotating supermassive stars from the onset of collapse using three-dim
 ensional general-relativistic hydrodynamics with fully dynamical spacetime 
 evolution. We show that seed perturbations in the progenitor can lead to th
 e formation of a system of two high-spin supermassive black holes\, which i
 nspiral and merge under the emission of powerful gravitational radiation. T
 he gravitational-wave signals could be observed at redshifts z>10  with the
  DECIGO or Big Bang Observer gravitational-wave observatories\, assuming  s
 upermassive stars in the mass range 10^4-10^6 M_\\odot. The potential detec

 </p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The standard picture of inflation is characterized by 
 a phase of exponential expansion followed by an epoch of reheating (aka the
  Big Bang).  However\, a natural consequence of inflationary models is the 
 radical notion of “eternal inflation\,” a hypothetical phase of the Univers
 e where there are always patches that are inflating.  In this talk\, we app

 ive Theory to attempt to address if our Universe is eternally inflating.  T
 o our surprise\, we find that the answer to this question requires knowledg
 e of the complete microscopic theory\, and is therefore incalculable within
  the effective description.  Using the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory to d
 etermine the stochastic fluctuations of the inflaton will inspire connectio

 r the universe to be viable. The first step is to determine what parameters
  are allowed to vary. In the realm of particle physics\, we must specify th
 e strengths of the fundamental forces and the particle masses. The relevant
  cosmological parameters include the density of the universe\, the cosmolog
 ical constant\, the abundance of ordinary matter\, the dark matter contribu
 tion\, and the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations. These quantiti
 es are constrained by the requirements that the universe lives for a suffic
 iently long time\, emerges from its early epochs with an acceptable chemica
 l composition\, and can successfully produce galaxies. On smaller scales\, 
 stars and planets must be able to form and function. The stars must have su
 fficiently\nlong lifetimes and hot surface temperatures.  The planets must 
 be large enough to maintain atmospheres\, small enough to remain non-degene
 rate\, and contain enough particles to support a biosphere. We also conside
 r specific fine-tuning issues in stars\, including the triple alpha reactio
 n that produces carbon\, the case of unstable deuterium\, and the possibili
 ty of stable diprotons. For all of these issues\, the goal of this enterpri
 se is to delineate the range of parameter space for which universes can rem
 ain habitable.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Pavel Motloch</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Superbubble Feedback in Galaxy Formation</b></p>\n
 \n<p>Abstract: We present new work on galactic feeback. Our new superbubble
 -based stellar feedback (Keller et al 2014) is due to clustered young stars
 .  It evolves differently to individual supernovae.  A hot superbubble phas
 e is required to correctly accumulate feedback from multiple\, clustered so
 urces\, including stellar winds and supernovae.  The model requires thermal
  conduction\, sub-grid evaporation and a temporary multi-phase treatment at
  lower resolution.  Thermal conduction physically sets the hot gas mass ass
 ociated with feedback and outflows (thus mass loading is not a free paramet
 er as in other models).  Prior approaches often heat too much mass\, leavin
 g the hot ISM below $10^6$ K and susceptible to rapid cooling without ad-ho
 c fixes.  High resolution single star cluster simulations are used to show 
 insensitivity to resolution and ISM conditions. The model produces a Kennic
 utt-Schmidt star formation rate law and strong outflows in SPH simulations 
 of Milky Way and dwarf galaxy analogues and regulates cosmological star for
 mation to the observed levels.  We discuss general implications for numeric
 al treatements of feedback and prospects for curtailing the embarassingly h
 igh number of free parameters in galaxy formation models today.</p>\n<p>Hos

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Electromagnetic Flares from the Tidal Disruption o
 f Stars by Massive Black Holes</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: A star that wanders 
 too close to a massive black hole (BH) gets shredded by the BH's tidal grav
 ity.  Stellar gas soon falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding t
 he Eddington rate\, releasing a flare of energy as gas accretes.  How often
  this process occurs is uncertain at present\, as is the physics of super-E
 ddington accretion (which is relevant for BH growth and feedback at high re
 dshift as well).  Excitingly\, transient surveys like the Palomar Transient
  Factory (PTF)\, Pan-STARRS and LSST should shed light on these questions s
 oon -- in anticipation\, I predict photometric and spectroscopic properties
  of tidal flares.  Early on\, much of the falling-back gas should blow away
  in a wind\, producing luminous optical emission imprinted with blueshifted
  UV absorption lines.  If the shock at pericenter is unable to thermalize\,
  photons should Compton upscatter to produce hard X-ray emission\, erasing 
 the UV lines but providing X-ray absorption lines.  I will describe predict
 ed detection rates for PTF\, Pan-STARRS and LSST\, and discuss the substant
 ial challenge of disentangling these events from supernovae.  These surveys
  should significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic
  nuclei\, the physics of super-Eddington accretion\, the demography of IMBH
 s\, and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs. </p>\n<p

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Large Misalignment Mechanism for Compact Halo 
 Formation</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Axions are some of the best motivated par
 ticles beyond the Standard Model. We show how the attractive self-interacti
 ons of dark matter (DM) axions over a broad range of masses\, from  $10^{-2
 2}$ eV to $10^7$ GeV\, can lead to non-gravitational growth of density fluc
 tuations and the formation of bound objects.  \nThis enhancement of structu
 re formation is driven by parametric resonance when the initial field misal
 ignment is large\; it affects axion density perturbations on length scales 
 of order the Hubble horizon when the axion field starts oscillating\, deep 
 inside the radiation-dominated era. This effect can turn an otherwise nearl
 y scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations into one that has a s
 pike at the aforementioned scales\, producing objects ranging from dense DM
  halos to nontrivial scalar field configurations such as solitons and oscil
 lons.\nWe call this class of cosmological scenarios for axion DM production
  "the large-misalignment mechanism''.\n\nWe explore observational consequen
 ces of this mechanism for axions with masses up to 10 eV. For axions heavie
 r than $10^{-5}$ eV\, the number density of compact axion halos is high eno
 ugh to significantly impact Earth-bound direct detection experiments\, yiel
 ding intermittent but coherent signals with repetition rates exceeding one 
 per decade\, and with each encounter lasting for a crossing time less than 
 a day.  These episodic large increases in the axion density and kinematic c
 oherence suggest new approaches for axion DM searches\, including those for
  the QCD axion. Dense structures made up of ultralight axions with masses i
 n the range from  $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^{-5}$ eV are detectable through grav
 itational lensing searches\, and their gravitational interactions can also 
 perturb baryonic structures and alter the star formation history of the Uni
 verse. \nAt sufficiently high misalignment amplitudes\, the axion field can
  undergo self-interaction-induced implosions long before matter-radiation e
 quality\, producing potentially detectable low-frequency stochastic gravita
 tional waves. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Alex L.</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>CPT-Symmetric Universe</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I w
 ill introduce our recent proposal that the state of the universe does *not*
  spontaneously violate CPT.  Instead\, the universe after the big bang is t
 he CPT image of the universe before it\, both classically and quantum mecha
 nically.  The pre- and post-bang epochs comprise a universe/anti-universe p
 air\, emerging from nothing directly into a hot\, radiation-dominated era. 
  CPT symmetry selects the QFT vacuum state on such a spacetime\, providing 
 a new interpretation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry\, as well as an e
 conomical explanation for the cosmological dark matter. Requiring only the 
 standard three-generation model of particle physics (with right-handed neut
 rinos)\, a $Z_2$ symmetry suffices to render one of the right-handed neutri
 nos stable. We calculate its abundance from first principles: matching the 
 observed dark matter density requires its mass to be $4.8 \\times 10^{8}$ G
 eV.  Several other testable predictions follow: (i) the three light neutrin
 os are Majorana and allow neutrinoless double beta decay\; (ii) the lightes
 t neutrino is massless\; and (iii) there are no primordial long-wavelength 
 gravitational waves.  The proposal also has interesting connections to the 
 strong CP problem and the observed electrodynamic arrow of time.</p>\n<p>Ho

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Two episodes in debris disk physics</b></p>\n\n<p>
 Abstract: I'll describe some recent work on two different kinds of debris d
 isks.\nThe first\, dusty disks around older stars\, are believed to be prod
 ucts of\nongoing collisional cascades. Standard collisional cascade theory 
 derives\na size distribution assuming a single constant velocity dispersion
  for all\nbodies. We relax this assumption to find self-consistent steady-s
 tate\nvelocity and size distributions. The resulting size distributions are
 \nsteeper than those found without velocity considerations: for example\, t
 he\nq=3.5 power-law index of the Dohnanyi size spectrum can become as large
  as\nq=4. Such differences are important when estimating total disk masses 
 via\nextrapolation from the observed dust. A theory of velocities also give
 s\nquantitative predictions of disk scale heights which\, together with ALM
 A\nobservations of edge-on disks\, may constrain the total mass in large\nb
 odies stirring the cascade and the colliding bodies' internal strengths.\n\
 nThe second is Saturn's A ring\, where kilometer-sized moonlets create\nS-s
 haped wakes called "propellers" in surrounding material. The Cassini\nspace
 craft has tracked the motions of propellers for several years and\nfinds th
 at they deviate from Keplerian orbits with constant semimajor\naxes. The in
 ferred orbital migration is known to switch sign. We show\nusing a statisti
 cal test that the time series of orbital longitudes of the\npropeller Bleri
 ot is consistent with that of a time-integrated Gaussian\nrandom walk. Stoc
 hastic migration of the right magnitude to explain the\nCassini observation
 s can be driven by encounters with ring particles 10-20\nm in radius\, a ra
 nge consistent with occultation analyses.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Shane Davis</b><

  probability on the number of objects involved in the interaction\, N\, is 
 found for fixed total energy and angular momentum. Our results are consiste

  space will be required in future studies to fully explore this potentially

  the Milky Way’s Galactic bar has punched a hole in the stream which can ex
 plain why the leading arm of Pal 5 appears to be a lot shorter than the tra

 e filled with dark matter subhalos of various sizes according to the cold d
 ark matter paradigm. One proposed method to detect subhalos is to search fo
 r them through disturbances in the structure of stellar streams\, as dark s
 ubhalos should create gaps if they pass through or close by stellar streams
 . My work implies that caution should be applied before interpreting stream
  gaps as evidence for dark matter subhalos. Additionally\, I will demonstra
 te how the Galactic bar’s interaction with the Pal 5 stream provides an int
 riguing methodology for studying our Milky Way’s Galactic bar in more detai

 p>Abstract: I will give an introduction to some aspects of Reduced Basis an
 d its applications to gravitational waves\, discussing results that we have

 ue is how to choose the most relevant points in parameter space\, in a near
 ly optimal way\, to select which configurations (of\, say\, binary black ho
 les or binary compact objects in general) are the "most representative ones
 ". This applies to the case in which the emitted gravitational waves can be

 imple equations but\, most important\, when deciding which configurations t
 o solve for in numerical simulations of the full Einstein equations. The ap
 proach also provides a way of interpolating between these selected configur
 ations to obtain other ones with high accuracy. We have so far found that t
 he representation error decays exponentially with the number of elements in
  the reduced basis\, providing dramatic savings (sometimes of several order
 s of magnitude) compared to traditional methods. The techniques are generic
  (i.e. not restricted to General Relativity) and fall within the area of re

  ongoing analytical modeling. I will also discuss secular collisional evolu

 eveal a rich structure: many axisymmetric configurations are saddle points 
 of the entropy function\, and are thermodynamically unstable to bifurcation
 s that favor a lopsided\, precessing disc at the same total energy and angu

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Kinetics of Spinning Stellar Systems\, or\, Ho
 w Delicate are Resonant Phenomena?</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Many galaxies ha
 ve a ‘bar’ structure at their center— an elongated collection of millions o
 f stars\, that spins as if it were a solid body. Galaxies are also embedded
  in massive dark matter haloes. When the rate at which the bar rotates reso
 nates with a dark matter particle’s orbital frequency\, the dark matter can
  suck angular momentum out of the bar\, causing it to slow down. The classi
 c theoretical description of this delicate 'bar-halo friction’ process cons
 ists of (i) the linear theory of Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs\, which predicts tha
 t bars in massive haloes should slow down rapidly\, and (ii) the nonlinear 
 theory of Tremaine & Weinberg\, which shows that the slowdown can sometimes
  be avoided. However\, those classic studies routinely ignored the fact tha
 t dark matter particles do not simply orbit in a smooth potential\, but als
 o experience random ‘diffusive’ kicks from other passing dark matter clumps
 \, gas clouds\, and so on. In this talk I will show one can account for thi
 s diffusion and study its impact upon resonant bar-halo friction. In partic
 ular\, I will show how diffusion ‘relinearizes’ the bar-halo friction probl
 em\, taking one out of the nonlinear Tremaine-Weinberg regime and back to t
 he linear Lynden-Bell-Kalnajs limit. I will discuss the implications of thi
 s result for the behavior of bars in both observations and cosmological sim
 ulations. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Rimpei Chiba</b></p>

  Black Hole (SMBH)\, the star tidally disrupts\, producing a luminous trans
 ient known as a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE).  The compact accretion disks 
 thought to form soon after a TDE were predicted to emit thermal radiation w
 hich peaked in the soft X-ray\, but TDEs detected in the subsequent decades
  often peaked in the near UV and optical\, sometimes emitting substantial a
 mounts of non-thermal hard X-ray emission which displayed Quasi-Periodic Os
 cillations (QPOs).  This talk discusses how relaxing the assumption of a ci
 rcular disk co-planar with a spinning SMBH’s equatorial plane may give rise
  to the rich electromagnetic spectra observed from TDEs.  In the first part
  of the talk\, I will discuss the dynamics of a highly-eccentric TDE accret
 ion disk\, which forms when the stellar debris on highly-elliptical traject
 ories do not completely circularize.  For our eccentric TDE disk model\, we
  find it is possible to generate UV and optical thermal emission consistent
  with the optically-bright TDEs observed.  In the talk’s second portion\, I
  will discuss how a TDE disk tilted to the equatorial plane of a spinning S
 MBH is warped due to differential Lens-Thirring precession\, how different 
 effects drive and damp the disk’s precession\, and discuss how this precess
 ion may drive QPOs in the hard X-ray emission of a TDE.  Allowing a TDE dis
 k to be eccentric and warped may give rise to the surprising diversity of T
 DE emission\, not predicted by the original TDE models.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>n/

 smic voids from matter/galaxy density fields by adopting a physically-motiv
 ated void-cluster correspondence theory that voids are the counterpart of m
 assive clusters. To prove the concept we use a pair of LCDM simulations\, a
  reference and its initial density-inverted mirror simulation\, and study t
 he relation between the effective size of voids and the mass of correspondi
 ng clusters. We study the voids corresponding to the halos more massive tha
 n 10^{13}Msol/h and find a power-law scaling relation between the void size
  and the corresponding cluster mass. We also find that the density profile 
 of the identified voids follows a universal functional form. Based on these
  findings\, we propose a method to identify cluster-counterpart voids direc
 tly from the matter/galaxy density field without their mirror information. 
 Using this method\, we achieve 70-74% (60-67%) of completeness and reliabil
 ity in recovering voids corresponding to clusters more massive than 3x10^{1
 4}Msol/h from a given matter (galaxy) density field. Our results demonstrat

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>New light on 21cm intensity fluctuations from the 
 dark ages</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Fluctuations of the 21 cm brightness temp
 erature before the formation of the first stars hold the promise of becomin
 g a high-precision cosmological probe in the future. The growth of over den
 sities is very well described by perturbation theory at that epoch and the 
 signal can in principle be predicted to arbitrary accuracy for given cosmol
 ogical parameters. Recently\, Tseliakhovich and Hirata pointed out a previo
 usly neglected and important physical effect\, due to the fact that baryons
  and cold dark matter (CDM) have supersonic relative velocities after recom
 bination. This relative velocity suppresses the growth of matter fluctuatio
 ns on scales k~10-10^3 Mpc^-1. In addition\, the amplitude of the small-sca
 le power spectrum is modulated on the large scales over which the relative 
 velocity varies\, corresponding to k~0.005-1 Mpc^-1. In this talk\, I will 
 describe the effect of the relative velocity on 21 cm brightness temperatur
 e fluctuations from redshifts z>=30. I will show that the 21 cm power spect
 rum is affected on most scales. On small scales\, the signal is typically s
 uppressed several tens of percent\, except for extremely small scales (k>=2
 000 Mpc-1) for which the fluctuations are boosted by resonant excitation of
  acoustic waves. On large scales\, 21 cm fluctuations are enhanced due to t
 he non-linear dependence of the brightness temperature on the underlying ga
 s density and temperature. The enhancement of the 21 cm power spectrum is o
 f a few percent at k~0.1 Mpc-1 and up to tens of percent at k<=0.005 Mpc-1\
 , for standard LCDM cosmology. In principle this effect allows to probe the
  small-scale matter power spectrum not only through a measurement of small 
 angular scales but also through its effect on large angular scales.</p>

 ires understanding the details of how gas is converted into stars over cosm

 riven outflows. Based on the results of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom

 molecule affects the measure of \nmolecular gas\, the treatment of the diff

 s on the precise relation between \ngas and star formation.\n\nUsing four d
 ifferent SF rate tracers Halpha+24 micron and non-linear \n24 micron (Calze
 tti et al. 2007\, ApJ\, 666\, 870)\; azimuthally averaged \nextinction corr
 ected Halpha (Prescott et al. 2007\, ApJ\, 668\, 182)\; FUV+24 \nmicron (Le
 roy et al. 2008\, AJ\, 136\, 2782) and several fitting procedures \n(Isobe 
 et al. 1990\, ApJ\, 364\, 104\; Press et al. 1992) we discuss the role \nof
  these different factors on the measure of the resolved \n(Schmidt-Kennicut
 t) star formation law at sub-kpc scales in NGC 4254 \n(M99\, a Sc spiral in
  the outskirts of the Virgo cluster)\, using \nhigh-resolution multi-wavele
 ngth data.\n\nOur results show that the intrinsic scatter in the Schmidt-Ke
 nnicutt type \nSF law varies with the choice of the SF tracer used. For exa
 mple\, the \nnon-linear 24 micron SF tracer shows the tightest correlation 
 with the \nmolecular gas content whereas (azimuthally averaged) extinction 
 corrected \nHalpha as a tracer appears to be the noisiest. Our study shows 
 that \ndifferent choices SF tracers and fitting algorithms lead to the diff
 erences \nin the estimated slope of the SF law. For a given fitting procedu
 re\, the \nnon-linear 24 micron SF tracer has the shallowest slope (N ~ 0.9
 0 - 1.0)\, \nthe (azimuthally averaged) extinction corrected Halpha SF trac
 er\, on the \nother hand\, gives a super-linear (N ~ 1.6) slope. For the ot
 her two tracers \nthe estimated slopes lie in between the two extreme cases
  mentioned above. \n\nWe find that precise observational constraint on the 
 functional (linear \nor non-linear) form of the SF law requires an accurate
  estimate of the \nfraction of the diffuse emission. The diffuse emission m
 akes a significant \nfraction (~30-50%) of the total disk emission in the F
 UV (Meurer et al. \n1995\, AJ\, 110\, 2665)\, Halpha (Walterbos & Braun 199
 4\, ApJ\, 431\, 156)\, and \nmid-IR 24 micron (Kennicutt et al. 2007\, ApJ\
 , 671\, 333) wavelengths. A \nclear understanding of the possible couplings
  between the diffuse emission \nand the emission coming from the star formi

 a remnants including particle acceleration</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: \nSupern
 ova remnants are believed to be the major contributors to Galactic cosmic r
 ays\, but direct evidence for highly energetic (PeV) protons in these objec
 ts remains elusive. In the last few years\, a new generation of gamma-ray i
 nstruments (Fermi\, Agile\, H.E.S.S.\, VERITAS\, MAGIC) has detected non-th
 ermal emission from SNRs at very high energies (from the GeV to the TeV)\, 
 but it is still difficult to disentangle the hadronic and leptonic contribu
 tions (a recent census of high-energy observations of all Galactic SNRs can
  be found at www.physics.umanitoba.ca/snr/SNRcat). However\, if protons are
  efficiently accelerated at the blast wave\, this should impact the dynamic
 s of the SNR\, and therefore its morphological and spectral evolution. Evid
 ence for modified shocks has been recently obtained with the Chandra and XM
 M-Newton satellites\, in young remnants such as Tycho and SN 1006. \n\nIn t
 his talk\, I will show how these effects can be investigated by the means o
 f numerical simulations. The code developed couples the hydrodynamical evol
 ution of the SNR with a non-linear kinetic model of diffusive shock acceler
 ation. At a given age\, is computed a posteriori: 1/ the non-equilibrium io
 nization state of the plasma and its thermal radiation (continuum and lines
 )\, and 2/ the transport of particles inside the SNR and their non-thermal 
 emission (synchrotron\, inverse Compton\, pion decay). The emission is inte
 grated along the line of sight to produce maps that can be compared with ob
 servations. I will show 1/ the impact of particle acceleration on the therm
 al X-ray emission of the SNR through modifications of the shock structure a
 nd conditions\, and 2/ the dependence of the non-thermal radio to gamma-ray
  emission of the SNR on a possible amplification of the magnetic field by t
 he particles themselves. These two points provide indirect diagnostics of t
 he presence of energetic protons.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Shane Davis</b></p>

 systematic modeling of the electromagnetic (EM) emission from an inspiralli
 ng black hole binary we consider a simple scenario in which the binary move
 s in a uniform magnetic field anchored to a distant circumbinary disc. We s
 tudy this system by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations in which the EM 
 fields are chosen with strengths consistent with the values expected astrop
 hysically and treated as test-fields. Our initial data consists of a series
  of binaries with spins aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular mo
 mentum and we study the dependence of gravitational and EM signals with dif
 ferent spin configurations. Overall we find that the EM radiation in the lo
 west l = 2\, m = 2 multipole accurately reflects the gravitational one\, wi
 th identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that differ only by a scaling 
 factor. This is no longer true when considering higher l modes\, for which 
 the amplitude evolution of the scaled EM emission is slightly larger\, whil
 e the phase evolutions continue to agree. We also compute the efficiency of
  the energy emission in EM waves and find that it scales quadratically with
  the total spin and is given by E^rad_EM / M ~ 10^-15 (M / 10^8 M_Sun)^2 (B
  / 10^4 G)^2\, EM hence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitation
 al energy for realistic magnetic fields. Additionally we present results ob
 tained on the geometry of apparent horizons in head-on unequal-mass binary 
 black-hole collisions. We use an harmonic evolution code to analyze some of
  the highly interesting features revealed by numerical simulations and conn

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Testing the H0 and σ8 tensions with galaxy surveys
  and large-scale structure</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The Lambda-CDM model has
  been incredibly successful at describing cosmological observations\, but r
 ecent tensions could be hints that we require a new standard cosmological m
 odel. In this talk I will describe two research programs testing cosmologic
 al tensions. First\, we measured the growth of structure and late-time ampl
 itude of matter fluctuations (S8) by combining the unWISE catalog of 500 mi
 llion infrared galaxies across the full sky with CMB lensing. unWISE galaxi
 es and ACT + Planck CMB lensing measure S8= 0.810 ± 0.015\, higher than the
  value of S8 preferred by cosmic shear and fully consistent with the amplit
 ude inferred from the primary CMB. The unWISE catalog has also enabled a we
 alth of science in tandem with the cosmic infrared background and other CMB
  secondary anisotropies\, and will continue to improve into the future with
  deeper WISE imaging and better characterization of its redshift distributi
 on. Second\, we introduce a new method for constraining the Hubble paramete
 r with large-scale structure independent of the CMB and the comoving sound 
 horizon. We isolate the amplitude of the baryonic feature in the observed g
 alaxy power spectrum and use it to measure the baryon fraction Ωb/Ωm. In co
 mbination with the BBN measurement of Ωbh2 and measurements of Ωm from the 
 Alcock-Paczynski effect\, we can measure H0 = 67.1+6.3-5.3 km/s/Mpc with BO
 SS. The full Euclid and DESI surveys offer an order of magnitude more volum
 e than BOSS and can constrain H0 to ~1.2 km/s/Mpc precision with this metho
 d. Finally\, I will conclude by discussing the future of these programs wit
 h the massive galaxy samples expected from ongoing and near-future surveys.

 </p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The expansion rate H0 measured directly is significant
 ly higher than inferred from cosmic microwave background measurements at hi
 gh redshift. Possible resolutions to this puzzle generally involve new phys
 ics in the pre-recombination era. I will describe a low redshift resolution
  based on the cepheid calibration of Supernova distances. Fifth forces due 
 to unscreened scalar fields can modify the period-luminosity relation of ce

 n\n<p>Abstract: Giant planets form the dynamical backbones of planetary sys

 r systems’ formation histories.  Recent discoveries of super-Earths on shor
 t period orbits and giant planets at wide separations have turned several c

  for gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics: the Advanced LIGO detectors will
  begin science operation in late 2015\, and may detect tens of gravitationa
 l wave signals from coalescing compact binaries per year.  Extracting astro
 physics from these signals---even the most basic information like masses---
 is a challenging problem: the mapping from parameters to signals is highly

 al techniques that we apply to solve it.  Then I will show how some of the 
 same techniques can be applied to analyze our best current constraints on t
 he properties of one likely AdLIGO source\, stellar-mass black holes\, and 
 how incomplete modeling may be responsible for the apparently strange prope
 rties of the mass distribution of low-mass black holes.  Finally\, followin
 g a different statistical thread from GWs to exoplanets\, I will show that 
 there is a wealth of information in "undetectable" GW signals\, and that th

 would provide a bounty to physics: e.g.\, a new redshift-distance measureme
 nt\, improved source localization\, and tighter constraints on source param
 eters (e.g.\, BH masses\, BH spins\, disk characteristics).  Previous simul
 ation work has focused on the two extremes: very close to merger where nume
 rical relativity is required\, or at large binary separations where Newtoni
 an gravity theory is accurate.  Our work here investigates an intermediate 
 regime\, where the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation is valid yet close eno
 ugh so that separation shrinkage timescale is comparable to matter inflow t
 imescales.  With our PN gravity model\, we evolve a magnetized disk using a
  modern general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code.  We will show that 
 many aspects of the disk follow the binary inward as its separation diminis
 hes up until when the binary shrinkage timescale becomes smaller than the i
 nflow timescale at the inner edge of the disk.  We will also present predic
 tions for the bolometric luminosity using our radiative cooling function as
  a proxy for emissivity.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Carlos Palenzuela</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Formation of satellites from rings : the beautiful
  case of Saturn\, and beyond</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract:  Saturn's rings\, like
  any astrophysical disc\, spread. When the ice blocs that constitute the ri
 ngs reach the Roche limit(*)\, they must aggregate into moonlets by self-gr
 avity. These moonlets then migrate outwards\, repelled by tidal interaction
 s with the rings and Saturn. We showed with numerical simulations that the 
 small and mid-sized moons of Saturn formed this way\, which explains their 
 composition and young age (Charnoz et al. 2010\, 2011).\n  Then\, analytica
 l calculations show this process generates satellites with a precise mass-d
 istance relation\, which matches that of the Saturnian system\, confirming 
 that it formed this way and explaining why Saturn's satellites are further 
 apart and larger\, as one moves away from the rings (Crida & Charnoz\, 2012
 ). This relation also surprisingly fits the Uranian and Neptunian systems\,
  suggesting that these planets used to have massive rings that gave birth t
 o their regular satellites\, and vanished.\n\n(*) The Roche radius is defin
 ed as the distance from a planet beyond which self-gravity is stronger than
  tidal forces\, allowing gravitationally bound aggregates to form\, and sat
 ellites to exist. Saturn’s rings are inside the Roche radius\, which is why
  they don’t coalesce into one single object.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Matt Russo<

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Observable Signatures of Coalescing Compact Binari
 es</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: A fraction of neutron star (NS) and black hole (
 BH) binaries are formed sufficiently compact that they will inspiral and me
 rge due to the emission of gravitational waves within a Hubble time. Such c
 ompact object mergers\, in addition to representing some of the most extrem
 e astrophysical events\, are among the most promising sources for the direc
 t detection of gravitational waves with ground based interferometers such a
 s LIGO and Virgo. Maximizing the science return of such a detection will\, 
 however\, require identifying a coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterpart
 . One possible source of EM emission is a short duration gamma ray burst (G
 RB)\, powered by the accretion of material that remains in a rotationally s
 upported torus around the central black hole. Although observations of shor
 t GRBs are largely consistent with the merger model\, the puzzling discover
 y has been made that many of them are followed by late ray flaring\, which 
 does not fit current theory and may require considering alternative progeni
 tor models. Another source of EM emission from NS mergers is a supernova li
 ke optical transient\, powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements s
 ynthesized in neutron rich ejecta from the merger. I will present the first
  calculations of the radioactively powered transients from mergers that inc
 lude realistic nuclear physics and radiative transport\, and I will discuss
  the prospects for detecting and identifying such events following a gravit
 ational wave trigger. In the second part of my talk I will describe a model
  for accretion following the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by a NS or B
 H. I will demonstrate that densities and temperatures in the disk are suffi
 ciently high to burn the white dwarf material into increasingly heavier ele
 ments at sequentially smaller radii. Because the energy released by nuclear
  reactions is comparable to that released gravitationally\, I introduce the
  concept of a "nuclear dominated accretion flow". I will argue that outflow
 s from the disk power a ~ week long transient\, which may be related to rec
 ently-discovered classes of subluminous supernovae.\n \n   </p>\n<p>Host: <

 as recently discovered at the Galactic center moving rapidly toward the bla
 ck hole. Its properties are unlike most of the fast moving stars in this re
 gion: it is very red with no detectable K-band continuum\, and has strong h
 ydrogen line emission features. These properties have led to the hypothesis
  that G2 is a gas cloud on approach toward Sgr A*. If G2 is a gravitational
 ly unbound gas cloud\, then it will be tidally stripped by Sgr A* as it goe
 s through closest approach\, providing us with an unprecedented view of acc
 retion onto a supermassive black hole. However\, a gravitationally unbound 
 gas cloud should not be able to survive in this region for very long. Alter
 natively\, G2 may be of stellar nature -- such as a proto-planetary disk\, 
 embedded protostar\, etc. Such a source will result in significantly less a
 ccretion onto black hole. I will present imaging and spectroscopic observat
 ions of G2 from the Keck Telescopes. These data show that the orbit of G2 i
 s more eccentric and has a later time of closest approach to the black hole
  compared to previously reported results. This orbit also places G2 away fr
 om a structure which was previously proposed as the gas tail of the object.
  I will also discuss the temporal evolution of the spectra of the object\, 
 and how the current imaging and spectroscopic data compares to the hypothes
 es that G2 is a gas cloud or star.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Fabio Antonini</b></p

  field\, and especially estimating its lowest order moment\, the bulk flow\
 , has been a popular pursuit among aficionados in the cosmological communit
 y for three decades now. Other than estimating the magnitude and direction 
 of the flow\, one of the main difficulties has been defining the scale of f
 low detected. Currently\, it seems that the main contentious issue is exact
 ly that\, what is the scale of the flow. There is a nearly universal agreem
 ent as to the direction of the flow\, however\, there is a great disagreeme
 nt as to the magnitude as a function of scale of the flow. The way various 
 groups define the scale\, and thus compare to theoretical expectations vari
 es greatly which lead to disagreements and thus lack of consensus among pra
 ctitioners. We developed and applied the Minimal Variance (MV) formalism to
  optimize and clearly define the scale of a particular analysis\, using the
  width of the survey window function as a proxy for scale. Comparing the MV
  ideal window function to any analysis window function provides an unbiased
  estimate to the survey width (or scale) and thus provides a method to dire

 field of 21cm cosmology will provide qualitatively new insights into astrop
 hysics and cosmology. Current and upcoming radio interferometer arrays will
  survey the distribution and ionization state of hydrogen at high redshifts
  (z ~ 6 to 13)\, providing the first direct observations of a thus far unex

  will enable precise constraints on cosmic dawn\, when the first stars and 
 galaxies formed and systematically ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). 
 In this talk\, I will present the latest limits on the cosmological 21cm si
 gnal from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER)
 . These limits already place scientifically interesting constraints on the 
 high-redshift IGM and suggest at least a minimal amount of X-ray heating fr
 om the first galaxies. I will then present forecasts of the expected perfor
 mance of the recently commenced Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)
 \, an instrument that promises to make high signal-to-noise characterizatio
 ns of the cosmological 21cm signal. Such measurements should allow a detail
 ed characterization of cosmic dawn\, removing key uncertainties in other co
 smological probes that arise from our currently poor understanding of the e
 poch. For example\, I will discuss how 21cm measurements can in principle p
 redict the optical depth to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\, enablin
 g CMB uncertainties on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations to be reduc

 ture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) was originally proposed as part of a 
 SKA concept. Since its inception of normal operation in 2020\, FAST data ha
 ve resulted in more than 100 peer-reviewed papers\, including four on the N
 ature magazine and one on Nature Astronomy. Such productivity evinces the u
 nparalleled sensitivity of FAST as well as the originality of a series of e
 xperimental techniques such as the high-cadence CAL\, which enables the Com
 mensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey (CRAFTS). CRAFTS realizes the world’s fi
 rst commensal survey of pulsars\, HI imaging\, HI galaxies\, and fast radio
  bursts (FRBs). Through CRAFTS\, we have so far discovered more than 150 pu
 lsars\, including one double-neutron-star system (DNS)\, and 6 new high DM 
 (>1000 pc cm-3) fast radio bursts (FRBs)\, including one new repeater. The 
 HI images and galaxies from CRAFTS are close to publication quality. I will

  to try to determine the nature of this scalar field and its role in fundam

 ></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Simulations predict that the spatial distribution of 
 the intergalactic medium\, the cosmic web\, has a profound impact on the ev
 olution of galaxies. Gas accretion provides the fuel for star formation\, w
 hich is inhibited by outflows powered by supernova explosions and active ga
 lactic nuclei (AGN). I will discuss the accretion of gas onto haloes and ga
 laxies\, its impact on star formation\, and its observability. Using cosmol
 ogical simulations we found that galaxy accretion rates are much lower than
  halo accretion rates and much more dependent on processes such as metal-li
 ne cooling and feedback from star formation and AGN. For massive haloes\, t
 he maximum past temperature distribution is bimodal. Cold-mode gas does not
  experience a virial shock near the virial radius\, whereas hot-mode gas he
 ats up to the virial temperature. Cold-mode gas accretes along the filament
 s of the cosmic web\, has a higher density and larger inward velocities\, w
 hereas hot-mode gas is more vulnerable to galactic winds and pushed out to 
 several times the virial radius. Cold-mode gas is therefore much more impor
 tant for the fuelling of galaxies\, and thus for the star formation that fo
 llows\, than it is for the growth of haloes. Unfortunately there is little 
 direct observational evidence for the predicted cold accretion flows inside
  haloes. I will show that they are\, however\, crucial for matching the neu
 tral hydrogen column density distribution\, allowing us to conclude that th
 ey do not only exist\, but have already been detected as Lyman-limit and da
 mped Lyman-$\\alpha$ systems.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marcelo Alvarez</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Constraining the atomic conditions suitable for th

 gen (HI) is the main ingredient for molecule formation and survival in the 
 diffuse ISM. Yet\, the role and importance of multiphase HI structure in th
 e transition from atomic to molecular gas is still not understood. We have 
 used observations of HI emission and absorption (Arecibo\, VLA) and observa
 tions of HCO+\, CCH\, HCN\, and HNC absorption (ALMA\, NOEMA) to connect th
 e early stages of molecule formation in the diffuse ISM with the underlying
  atomic gas properties. We find that these molecular species form along sig
 htlines where AV > 0.25\, similar to the HI-to-H2 transition at solar metal
 licity. The sightlines with the highest molecular column densities also hav
 e the most thermally unstable HI. We also detect a broad\, faint component 
 to the HCO+ absorption that is coincident with HI that has a low cold neutr
 al medium fraction. Using the Gaussian decomposition of the absorption spec
 tra\, we also establish thresholds for the optical depth\, temperature\, an
 d turbulent Mach number of HI gas structures with a molecular component. By
  comparing to PDR chemical model predictions\, we find that the kinetic tem
 perature separates our sample into two distinct categories. A lower HCO+ co
 lumn density sample can be explained with modest density\, FUV radiation fi
 eld\, and cosmic ray ionization rate (CRIR) models\, while a higher HCO+ co
 lumn density sample requires models with high density\, FUV radiation field
 \, and CRIR. The structures in the higher HCO+ column density sample have h
 igher temperatures and are found in directions with more thermally unstable
  HI than the structures in the lower HCO+ column density sample. We have re
 cently observed SiO in the direction of several of these structures to inve
 stigate the role of shocks in enhancing molecule formation and test the val

 argue that reflection of relic neutrinos from the surface of the Earth crea

 a-urchin: they consist of rods of width w and length L>>w periodically arra
 nged on the surface of the sphere of radius R~L. Such a structure functions
  as a diffraction grating for relic neutrinos and the induced neutrino-anti
 neutrino asymmetry at its center may point to a new class of experiments to
  detect the CνB in a laboratory setting. At the same time\, such structures
  can be used to similarly manipulate dark matter. </p>\n

 illar of the current cosmological paradigm. While CDM predictions are in go
 od agreement with observations of the cosmic microwave background\, large-s
 cale structures\, and the dynamics of clusters and galaxies\, the physics o
 f dark matter is unknown.   Recent observations probing small astrophysical
  scales might indicate deviations from the standard CDM scenario. We introd
 uce a model of dark-matter physics in which the dark sector\, due to a new 
 dark force\, is made of atom-like bound states. This model predicts \ndiffe
 rent dark-matter properties on small scales but retains the success of CDM 
 on cosmological scales. In the early Universe\, the dark sector forms a tig
 htly-coupled plasma sustaining acoustic wave that can leave observable sign
 atures in the matter power spectrum. The kinetic decoupling of dark matter 
 in this model is significantly delayed compared to a typical WIMP model lea
 ding to a significant damping of fluctuations on small scales. We revisit t

 sector and show significant improvements over the standard hydrogen calcula

 re is no actually lack of angular correlation in the CMB.\n(2) I construct 
 simple quadratic estimators to reconstruct asymmetry in the primordial powe
 r-spectrum from CMB temperature and polarization data and verify their accu
 racy using simulations with quadrupole power asymmetry. I show that the Pla

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The secret lives of magnetars</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstra
 ct: Magnetars are neutron stars that are powered by super-strong magnetic f
 ields stored in their interiors. They produce beautiful fireworks in x-rays
  and gamma-rays: small\, large\, and stupendous flares\, fast quasi-periodi
 c oscillations\, as well as transient increases of their  luminosities on t
 imescales of months to years. How the release of magnetic energy leads to t
 his rich variability is not precisely understood\, but the processes respon
 sible for it may well be hidden under the surfaces of the stars\, in their 
 solid crusts and super-fluid cores. Often\, it is thought that mechanical f
 ailure of the crust\, under the intense magnetic stresses\, may be responsi
 ble for some of this behaviour. In this talk\, I will discuss theoretical w
 ork on how the magnetar crust does and does not fail. In particular\, I wil
 l first show that magnetic field is very effective in suppressing the produ
 ction of seismic waves in conventional earth-quake-type shear failures. I w
 ill  then discuss a new type of failure that is likely to occur in magnetar
 s' crusts \, a thermo-plastic wave.  These  do not have direct terrestrial 
 analogues\, and behave qualitatively like deflagration fronts.  I will argu
 e that they may be one of the ingredients driving the  magnetars' transient
  activity. Finally\, I will comment on the recent claimed observation of  f
 ree precession in a magnetar\, and will describe the chain of events that w
 ould be required to cause this precession.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Christa van Lae

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>HIERARCHICAL BLACK HOLE MERGERS: A MULTI-BAND OPPO
 RTUNITY FOR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: With about a hundre
 d binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected via gravitational wave emission\
 , our understanding of the darkest objects in the Universe has seen unparal
 leled steps forward compared to previous decades. While most of the events 
 are expected to consist of first-generation BHs formed from the collapse of
  massive stars\, others might be of a second or higher generation\, contain
 ing the remnants of previous BH mergers. A fundamental limit for hierarchic
 al mergers comes from the recoil kick imparted to merger remnants\, which c
 ould result in the ejection from the host star cluster. However\, hierarchi
 cal mergers can build up massive BHs and even form intermediate-mass black 
 holes if the host cluster is massive and dense enough\, as in nuclear star 
 clusters and the most massive globular clusters. With their distinctive sig
 natures of higher masses and spins\, hierarchical mergers offer an unpreced
 ented opportunity to learn about the densest systems in our Universe and to
  shed light on the elusive population of intermediate-mass black holes. The
  next years may bring hundreds of detections from hierarchical mergers with
  multi-band events chirping from space-based to ground-based detectors\, pr
 omising a spectacular range of new science from stellar evolution to cosmol

 the complex role that environment plays in the evolution of galaxies has lo
 ng been an outstanding problem in the field of galaxy formation.  While stu
 dies of the low-redshift universe have given us a basic picture of how envi
 ronment affects galaxies\, significant details on the astrophysics of these
  processes are lacking.  One of the major challenges is that most of the “a

  = 0 and are therefore limited to observing the “aftermath” of this action.
   Over the last decade several deep surveys of z = 1 clusters have been don
 e\, and a basic picture linking how environment affects galaxies at both hi
 gh and low redshift is emerging.  I will discuss some of these recent resul
 ts and will highlight how the upcoming Euclid\, JWST\, and TMT observatorie
 s will provide transformational data toward completing our understanding of
  the astrophysics of how environment affects galaxy formation within the ne

 tion on the growth and saturation of the double-diffusive fingering (thermo
 haline) instability at low Prandtl number. Using direct numerical simulatio
 ns\, we estimate the compositional transport rates as a function of the rel
 evant nondimensional parameters—the Rossby number\, inversely proportional 
 to the rotation rate\, and the density ratio that measures the relative the
 rmal and compositional stratifications. Within our explored range of parame
 ters\, we generally find rotation to have little effect on vertical transpo
 rt. However\, we also present one exceptional case where a cyclonic large-s
 cale vortex (LSV) is observed at low density ratio and fairly low Rossby nu
 mber. The LSV leads to significant enhancement in the fingering transport r
 ates by concentrating compositionally dense downflows at its core. We argue
  that the formation of such LSVs could be relevant to solving the missing-m
 ixing problem in RGB stars and possibly in giant planets.</p>\n

 as possible to use a large number of particles. We studied both an equal ma

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>SpArcFiRe: Scalable Automated Detection of Spiral 
 Galaxy Arm Segments</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Given an approximately centered
  image of a spiral galaxy\, we describe an entirely automated method that f
 inds\, centers\, and sizes the galaxy (possibly masking nearby stars and ot
 her objects if necessary in order to isolate the galaxy itself) and then au
 tomatically extracts structural information about the spiral arms. For each
  arm segment found\, we list the pixels in that segment\, allowing image an
 alysis on a per-arm-segment basis. We also perform a least-squares fit of a
  logarithmic spiral arc to the pixels in that segment\, giving per-arc para
 meters such as the pitch angle\, arm segment length\, location\, etc. The a
 lgorithm takes about 1 minute per galaxy\, and can easily be scaled using p
 arallelism. We have run it on all ~644\,000 Sloan objects that are larger t
 han 40 pixels across and classified as "galaxy". We find a very good correl
 ation between our quantitative description of spiral structure and the qual
 itative description provided by Galaxy Zoo humans. Our objective\, quantita
 tive measures of structure demonstrate the difficulty in defining exactly w
 hat constitutes a spiral "arm"\, leading us to prefer the term "arm segment
 ". We find that pitch angle often varies significantly segment-to-segment i
 n a single spiral galaxy\, making it difficult to define "the" pitch angle 
 for a single galaxy. We demonstrate how our new database of arm segments ca
 n be queried to find galaxies satisfying specific quantitative visual crite
 ria. For example\, even though our code does not explicitly find rings\, a 
 good surrogate is to look for galaxies having one long\, low-pitch-angle ar
 m-which is how our code views ring galaxies. SpArcFiRe is available at http

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Accelerating compact object mergers and collisions
  in binaries in galactic nuclei\, and in quadruple star systems — implicati
 ons for gravitational wave sources and Type Ia supernovae</b></p>\n\n<p>Abs
 tract: We consider mergers and collisions of compact objects induced by dyn
 amical interactions in two contexts. In the first part of the talk\, we dis
 cuss mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in binary systems in galacti
 c nuclei. Most galactic nuclei are known to harbor a massive BH (MBH). Bina
 ries in these environments are susceptible to the Lidov-Kozai (LK) mechanis
 m due to the torque of the central MBH\, which can drive binaries to high e
 ccentricities and trigger strong interactions such as the emission of gravi
 tational waves (GWs)\, and\, ultimately\, BH mergers. These events are pote
 ntial sources for GW detectors such as aLIGO and VIRGO. The LK mechanism is
  only effective if the binary is highly inclined with respect to the MBH\, 
 implying low rates compared to the inferred aLIGO rates. However\, close to
  an MBH\, $\\sqrt{N}$-torques from the stellar cluster give rise to vector 
 resonant relaxation (VRR)\, which affects the orientation of the binary aro
 und the MBH. This process can bring a binary with low inclination into an `
 active' LK regime in which high eccentricities\, and\, subsequently\, stron
 g interactions are triggered. We study the coupled LK-VRR dynamics\, and in
 vestigate the potential enhancement of LK dynamics due to VRR.\n\nIn the se
 cond part of the talk\, we consider Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produced by
  colliding white dwarfs (WDs). Katz \\& Dong showed in 2012 that high-eccen
 tricity LK oscillations in triple star systems can lead to collisions of WD
 s\, which are known to likely result in SNe Ia explosions. However\, other 
 authors subsequently showed that the rates are likely low compared to obser
 vations because many potential progenitor systems (i.e.\, highly inclined s
 ystems) would experience mergers during the pre-WD evolution. An alternativ
 e pathway has been proposed in quadruple star systems\, in which the typica
 lly longer secular time-scales might alleviate these problems. Here\, we co
 nsider the dynamical and stellar evolution of quadruple systems\, in both t
 he 2+2 (two binaries orbiting each other’s barycentre) and 3+1 (triple orbi
 ted by a fourth star) configurations. We demonstrate the existence of sever
 al pathways that lead to WD collisions\, and estimate their rates. We find 
 that the collision-induced SNe Ia rates from quadruples are comparable to t
 hose previously found for stellar triples. However\, these rates are severa
 l orders of magnitude lower compared to the observations\, indicating that 
 collision-induced SNe Ia from triples and quadruples are rare. </p>\n<p>Hos

 xtends to dwarf irregulars in the field to the more massive spheroidals in 
 high-density environments.  By connecting empirical constraints derived for
  star formation at low gas column densities and metallicities with a model 
 for dark matter and baryonic mass assembly\, we attempt a new look at how t

 e resident gas content\, initially reduced from the cosmic average by the t
 hermal pressure of the reionized intergalactic medium\, was finally ram pre
 ssure stripped during the accretion onto the Milky Way or Andromeda.  Satel
 lites of differing luminosities seem to share similar most massive progenit
 or histories that reach thresholds for gas cooling by atomic line emission 
 at epochs at which the Local Group should have been reionized\, and so we h
 ypothesize that was star formation under reionized conditions that defined 
 their properties.  This hypothesis leads us to reproduce the empirical lumi
 nosity-size and luminosity-metallicity relations. We speculate that the tru

 apidly star-forming galaxies. Observations have revealed these outflows to 
 be complex\, multiphase phenomena\, with gas at a large range of densities 
 and temperatures traveling at speeds from a few tens to more than 1000 kilo
 meters per second. Describing how these outflows originate\, evolve\, and a
 ffect the circumgalactic medium and gas supply of galaxies is an important 
 challenge for theories of galaxy evolution. In this talk\, I will discuss h

 at I wrote to take advantage of the newest generation of supercomputers. Wi
 th Cholla\, we can perform large\, three-dimensional simulations of multiph
 ase outflows\, allowing us to track the coupling of mass and momentum betwe

 lts of our recent simulations demonstrate that the evolution of cool gas in
  galactic winds is highly dependent on the initial structure of embedded cl

 louds (IRDCs) are believed to be the precursors to star clusters and massiv
 e stars. The complex intertwined braid-like structure of IRDCs poses a chal
 lenge to theorists to explain their dynamics and formation. We have perform
 ed large-scale adaptive mesh refinement\, driven turbulence\, MHD simulatio
 ns to study the structure and formation of IRDCs. Filamentary structure eme
 rges naturally from our simulations. Magnetic field lines pierce the dark c
 loud filament primarily in the direction normal to the filament axis. The c
 olumn density profiles of the main features are well fit by the power law N
  ∝ r-n with n from 0.6 to 0.8 as observations have found. The dark cloud fi
 laments in the simulation resemble the dark cloud SDC13 and our 3D simulati
 ons are used to explain the observed structure and dynamics of SDC13. We ha
 ve carried out the most detailed analysis to date of the magnetic field pro
 perties of the cloud clumps in our simulations (Li\, McKee and Klein\, 2015
 )\, finding excellent agreement with the Zeeman observations of Crutcher et
  al. (2010). We then perform deep zoom-in simulations into the main IRDC fi
 lament that include the fully coupled effects of magnetic fields\, protoste
 llar outflows\, and radiation transport\, and continue one of the simulatio
 ns to study the formation of a stellar cluster inside IRDCs.  By including 
 radiation feedback and proto-stellar outflows\, we obtain a proto-stellar m
 ass function (PMF) for comparison with theoretical PMFs and the Chabrier IM
 F.  In this talk\, I will discuss key aspects of our simulations that addre
 ss the formation of filamentary IRDCs\, their complex braided filamentary s
 tructure\, the magnetic properties of cloud clumps inside the IRDC filament
 s\, and the properties of star cluster formation in the first half of a fre

 calibrating theoretical models against observed Milky Way and extragalactic
  globular clusters\, we find that the mergers of dynamically formed binarie
 s could eventually be detected by Advanced LIGO at a rate of ~ 100 per year
 \, potentially dominating the overall detection rate of gravitational wave 
 sources. Dynamical processes in globular clusters can also form very natura

 </b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Black-hole recoils are arguably the strong-gravity
  phenomena with the most striking astrophysical consequences. In the late i
 nspiral and final coalescence of black-hole binaries\, anisotropic emission
  of gravitational waves causes significant linear momentum loss. The remnan
 t black hole\, therefore\, recoils in the opposite direction. These final k
 icks can reach magnitudes up to 5000 km/s (“superkicks”)\, larger than the 
 escape speed of even the most massive galaxies\, thus opening the possibili
 ty of black hole ejections. In this talk\, I summarize recent advances in m
 odeling black-hole recoils and their astrophysical environments. I will add
 ress the relevance of disk-assisted spin alignment\, new approaches to mode
 l black-hole recoils with waveform approximants\, and prospects to directly
  detect superkicks with gravitational-wave detectors.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Ka

  by LIGO/Virgo have been making headlines because these events’ nature has 
 been far from the expectations. But why are we puzzled? And what is the roa

 not detected such systems in the radio observations before and how the key 
 to understanding these events might lie in the r-process enrichment in the 
 early universe and magnetic field evolution of neutron stars. Through these

 n<p>Abstract: Numerical solutions to Newton’s equations of motion for chaot
 ic self gravitating systems are often regarded to be irreversible.   This  
 is  due  to  the  exponential  growth  of  irreversible numerical  errors. 
   We  demonstrate  that  when numerical errors are reduced to below an init
 ial physical perturbation and its exponential growth during integration the
   microscopic  reversibility  is  retrieved.   Time  reversibility  itself 
  is  not  a  guarantee  for  a  definitive  solution  to the chaotic N-body
  problem.  However\, time reversible algorithms may be used to find initial
  conditions for which perturbed trajectories converge rather than diverge. 
  The ability to calculate such a converging pair of solutions is a striking
  illustration which shows that it is possible to compute a definitive solut
 ion to a highly unstable problem.  This works as follows:  If you (i) use a
  code which is capable of producing a definitive solution (and which will t
 herefore handle converging pairs of solutions correctly)\, (ii) use it to s
 tudy the statistical result of some other problem\, and then (iii) find tha
 t some other code produces a solution S with statistical properties which a
 re indistinguishable from those of the definitive solution\, then solution 
 S may be deemed veracious.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Terry Tricco</b></p>

 <p>Abstract: The impact of density fluctuations with wavelengths larger tha
 n a survey must be considered when extracting cosmological information from
  power spectrum measurements.  These modes change the power spectrum in the
  same way as a change in the cosmological background does.  Using a handful
  of separate universe simulations\, we accurately capture this effect in te
 rms of response of the matter power spectrum to a single mode --- the mean 
 density fluctuation in the survey volume. The unknown amplitude of this mea
 n density mode contributes to a (typically dominant) error in the matter po
 wer spectrum estimators.  Alternatively\, it can also be simply included in
  parameter estimation and forecasts by treating the mean density fluctuatio
 n as an additional cosmological parameter. Parameter degeneracies arise sin
 ce the response of the power spectrum to the mean density mode and cosmolog
 ical parameters share similar properties in changing the growth of structur
 e and dilating the scale of features.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Ue-Li Pen</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Marvelous Success of the Standard Model of Cos
 mology</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has been rem
 arkably successful in its predictions for current data given earlier data. 
  One can react with sadness for the lack of evidence for new physics\, chas
 e marginal anomalies\, or marvel at the success and soldier on toward bette
 r measurements knowing new physics may be just around the corner.  In this 
 talk I will reveal some of the inner workings of this success in order to c
 ommunicate why I find it marvelous.  For example\, for the predictions to a
 gree with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data we need\, at very high sta
 tistical significance\, a cosmic neutrino background\, electron-positron an
 nihilation occurring after neutrino decoupling\, primordial helium and grav
 itational lensing.  Perhaps most marvelous of all\, from CMB data we can no
 w rule out a sum of neutrino masses greater than about  1 eV because of the
 ir gravitational influence on freely streaming CMB photons.</p>\n<p>Host: <

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>STAR FORMATION IN THE MULTIPHASE INTERSTELLAR MEDI
 UM OF GALAXIES</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Star formation is at the nexus of as
 trophysics: stars are believed to be responsible for the re-ionization of t
 he universe\, they created all the heavy elements\, they control the format
 ion and evolution of galaxies\, and the formation of stars naturally leads 
 to the formation of planets. It is therefore critical to understand the rat
 e at which stars form. Observations of the star formation rate are encapsul
 ated in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relations between the star formation rate and
  the amount of gas in a galaxy. Observations have shown that stars form in 
 molecular gas\, and theory suggests that this is because the conditions tha
 t permit the formation of H2 molecules are the same as those needed for the
  gas to be cold. Observations have also shown that star formation is ineffi
 cient---the fraction of the mass of a molecular cloud that is converted int
 o stars is about 1% per free-fall time in environments as diverse as small\
 , local molecular clouds and and starburst galaxies. The overall features o
 f these observations are naturally explained in the theory of turbulence-re
 gulated star formation together with a determination of the molecular fract
 ion in a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM)\; this theory applies over a 
 wide range of conditions. Much more precise agreement with observations of 
 nearby disk galaxies can be obtained with the thermal/dynamical equilibrium
  theory that determines the star formation rate needed to maintain the mult
 iphase ISM in such galaxies.\n</p>

  on the first genetic code</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Protoplanetary disks pro
 vide the initial conditions for planet formation as well as for their prebi
 otic states. In this talk I will examine both how planets form and how terr
 estrial planets come to be "equipped" with water and biomolecules.  Standar
 d models for planet formation in dusty\, gaseous disks reveal that planets 
 rapidly migrate during their formation. This process is so efficient that p
 lanets risk plunging into their central stars within a million years.  I sh
 all review observations and ideas of what controls the process of exoplanet
  formation and migration.  I will then present our own recent simulations o
 f migrating and accreting planets in radiatively heated protostellar disks 
 containing dead zones - regions where turbulence is strongly suppressed. We
  have discovered that both the density and thermal structure of disks with 
 dead zones act as effective brakes that prevent the rapid loss of planets t
 o their central stars.\n\nThe radiatively heated natal disks that produce p
 lanets may also be significant factories for the synthesis of biomolecules 
 such as amino acids\, which may be delivered to planets by cometary or mete
 oritic bombardment. We have recently discovered some general thermodynamic 
 constraints on the synthesis of amino acids in a variety of prebiotic envir
 onments. This provides insight into the environments which produced biomole
 cules for early life and possible constraints on the nature of the first ge
 netic code.\n</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Feedback from Black Holes in Massive Galaxies</b><
 /p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Abstract: Black holes\, resident in the centers of gala
 xies\, will be fed by accretion of ambient gas whenever gas reaches those c
 entral regions. This can be due to mergers\, but even without mergers the e
 volution of the stellar populations of normal galaxies provides very large 
 amounts of gas\, as stars pass through the planetary nebula stage\, the tot
 al mass release being greater than 10-11 Msolar for massive ellipticals. Mu
 ch of that gas will cool and fall to the centers of the systems\, where it 
 will induce starbursts and accretion events onto the central black holes. A
 ccretion then induces outbursts of UV from the BH discs\, Xrays from corona
 l gas and polar\, radiation driven winds\, with the efficiencies in these t
 hree categories roughly 10^{-1}\, 10^{-2} & 10^{-3}. The mass\, momentum an
 d energy in these outbursts can have dramatic consequences for the growth o
 f the BH and for the ambient galaxy. Most AGN feedback treatments do not in
 clude the radiation\, mass and momentum components. We follow these events 
 with 1D\, 2D and 3D hydrodynamic codes. BH growth is similar to what has be
 en found by others\, but the momentum driving produces much more energetic 
 winds than does thermal feedback and black hole growth is less inhibited by
  outflows in multidimensional sims. Observable consequences include the nar
 row line AGN absorption lines\, shock accelerated synchrotron emitting part
 icles and wind driven bubbles in the IGM. In addition\, we find that\, sinc
 e feedback inhibits inflow\, accretion is episodic and the “duty cycle” is 
 low. The simulations help us to understand many phenomena including the bla
 ck hole stellar mass relation\, “quenching” of star formation\, narrow abso
 rption lines\, the thermal X-rays from ellipticals\, the incidence of the “
 E+A” phenomena and the observed fact that most of the black holes found in 
 galactic centers are found in the “off” state.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>See below</

  In the presence of a massive bosonic field\, a spinning black hole is in f
 act unstable to superradiance. This provides a novel way to look for axions
 \, dark photons\, and other ultralight bosons with Compton wavelength compa
 rable to the black hole's radius. I will describe black hole superradiance 
 in the linear and nonlinear regimes\, including how the superradiant instab
 ility saturates by slowing the rotation of the black hole to match the freq
 uency of the bosonic cloud that spontaneously forms around it.  I will also
  discuss how such bosonic clouds decay through the emission of gravitationa
 l radiation\,\nwhich could be an interesting target for LIGO and other grav

 nsity. We construct one-zone steady-state models of cosmic ray (CR) spectra
  in star-forming \ngalaxies ranging from normal galaxies to the densest sta
 rbursts\, \ncalculating both the radio and gamma-ray emission. We then calc
 ulate the broadband emission of primary and secondary CR protons\, electron
 s\, and positrons. We find the FRC is caused by conspiracies of several fac
 tors for galaxies across the range of the correlation\, including CR escape
  from galaxies\, UV opacity\, non-synchrotron cooling\, and secondary elect
 rons and positrons generated by CR protons. The conspiracies have great imp
 lications for the evolution of the FRC at high z\, actually preserving \nit
  to higher redshift than previously thought but allowing variations in the 
 FIR-radio ratio with different galaxy properties. Finally\, I describe how 
 the recent gamma-ray  observations of M82 and NGC 253 compare with our mode
 ls. These starbursts are somewhat less gamma-ray bright than we expect\, bu
 t still indicate substantial pionic losses for CR protons and non-synchrotr
 on cooling for CR electrons and positrons\, supporting the conspiracy.</p>\

 ework that the program Herschel HOBYS (P.I. F. Motte\, A. Zavagno\, S. Bont
 emps) has led a census and a systematic study of massive dense cores into n
 earby (Distance < 3 kpc) star-forming regions based on PACS et SPIRE images
  made in the five Herschel bandes (70\, 160\, 250\, 350 et 500 microns). Th

 ellar clusters appear to form preferentially at the filamentary junctions (
 ridges). In parrallel\, the HII region impact to the star-formation is stil

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Formation of the Magellanic Stream</b></p>\n\n
 <p>Abstract: One of the most surprising results to come out of HST in recen
 t years is that the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are moving faster tha
 n previously believed (Kallivayalil et al 2006a\,b) and may be on their fir
 st passage about the Milky Way (MW) (Besla et al 2007). Such a drastically 
 different orbital history overturns a paradigm that has existed for decades
  and consequently demands a revision of our understanding of the interactio
 n history of the Clouds and the accretion history of the MW and Local Group
 .  In particular\, the Magellanic Stream (MS)\, a coherent stream of HI fil
 aments that trails the Clouds 100 degrees across the sky\, can no longer be
  considered a product of MW tides or ram pressure acting on the Clouds.  \n
 \nWe propose an alternative mechanism for the formation of the MS in which 
 material is removed by LMC tides acting on the SMC before the system is acc
 reted by the MW.  Here the orbit of the Clouds is not assumed to be a free 
 parameter and is instead determined by the new HST proper motions. Furtherm
 ore\, both Clouds are modeled as live systems instead of assuming that one 
 is a fixed potential (or absent) as all previous models have done. The prop
 osed scenario clearly demonstrates that it is possible to explain the prope
 rties and origin of the MS under the assumption that the Clouds have not be
 en long term satellites of the MW.  In addition\, this study provides new i
 nsight into the hierarchical build up of galaxies\, late accretion events\,
   gas stripping mechanisms from satellites and dwarf-dwarf galaxy interacti
 ons.  \n\n</p>

 nse matter\n-- at and above nuclear density --  can only be achieved by the
  study of neutron stars\, and the thermal emission from quiescent low-mass 
 X-ray binaries inside globular clusters have proven very useful for that pu
 rpose.  The recent 1.97+/-0.04 Msun measurement for the radio pulsar PSR 16
 14-2230 suggests that strange quark matter and hyperons/kaons condensate eq
 uations of states (EoS) are disfavoured\, in favour of hadronic "normal mat
 ter" EoSs.  Over much of the neutron star mass-radius parameter space\, "no
 rmal matter" EoSs produce lines of quasi-constant radii (within the measure
 ment uncertainties\, of about 10%).   We present a simultaneous spectral an
 alysis of several globular cluster quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries where 
 we require the radius to be the same among all neutron stars analyzed.  The
  Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method and the Bayesian approach developed in thi
 s analysis permits including uncertainties in the distance\, in the hydroge
 n column density\, and possible contributions to the spectra due to un-mode
 lled spectrally hard components.  Our results suggest a neutron star radius
  much smaller than previously reported\, with a value Rns = 9.1 (+1.3)(-1.5
 ) km\, at 90% confidence\, using conservative assumptions\, which suggests 
 that neutron start matter is best described by the softest "normal matter" 
 equations of state.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Reconnection-driven plasmoids in blazars: fast fla
 res on a slow envelope</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Collimated\, relativistic ou
 tflows (jets) have been extensively observed to originate from supermassive
  black holes in the centers of galaxies. When the jet flow is moving close 
 to our line of sight (the so-called "blazar")\, it results in an extremely 
 bright\, broadband and variable source of electromagnetic radiation. The me
 chanisms responsible for the energetic\nparticles behind the jet emission r
 emain poorly understood.\nThe recent observations of powerful\, minute-time
 scale flares from  several blazars pose serious challenges to theoretical m
 odels for the blazar emission. The fast flaring requires extremely compact 
 regions in the jet that boost their emission towards the observer at an ext
 reme Doppler factor\nof delta~50 or larger. Furthermore\, for TeV photons t
 o avoid annihilation with ambient radiation at the source\, the flares must
  originate far from the black hole (at multi light-year distance). In this 
 talk\, I will introduce the magnetic reconnection model for the blazar flar
 ing. Focusing on the inherently time-dependent aspects of the process of ma
 gnetic reconnection\, I argue that\, for the physical conditions prevailing
  in blazar jets\, the reconnection layer fragments leading to the formation
  a large number of plasmoids. Occasionally a plasmoid grows to become a lar
 ge\, ``monster'' plasmoid.  I show that radiation emitted from the reconnec
 tion event can account for  the observed ``envelope'' of ~day-long blazar a
 ctivity while radiation from monster plasmoids can power the fastest observ
 ed TeV flares. The model is applied to several blazars with observed fast f
 laring. The inferred distance of the dissipation\, blazar\, zone is R~1-3 l
 ight-years. The required magnetization of the jet at this distance is sigma
 =B^2/4 pi rho c^2~ a few.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Linda Strubbe</b></p>

 p>Abstract: The possibility that the dark matter comprises primordial black
  holes (PBHs) is considered\, with particular emphasis on the currently all
 owed mass windows at 10^{16} – 10^{17}g\, 10^{20} – 10^{24}g and 10 – 10^3 
 M⊙. The last possibility is of special interest in view of the recent detec
 tion of black-hole mergers by LIGO.  All relevant constraints (lensing\, dy
 namical\, large-scale structure and accretion) are considered and various e
 ffects necessary for a precise calculation of the PBH abundance (non-Gaussi
 anity\, non-sphericity\, critical collapse) are accounted for. It is diffic
 ult to put all the dark matter in PBHs if their mass function is monochroma
 tic but this is still possible if the mass function is extended\, as expect
 ed in many scenarios. A novel procedure for confronting observational const
 raints with an extended PBH mass spectrum is therefore introduced. The talk
  will focus particularly on PBHs generated by inflation\, pointing out whic
 h effects in the formation process influence the mapping from the inflation
 ary power spectrum to the PBH mass function. The possibility that Planck ma
 ss relics of evaporating PBHs provide the dark matter is also considered. T
 his is an intriguing possibility but virtually untestable.</p>\n<p>Host: <b

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Oscillations in the CMB bispectrum - theory and da
 ta analysis</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Oscillating signatures in the correlati
 on functions of the primordial density perturbations are predicted by a var
 iety of inflationary models. A theoretical mechanism that has attracted muc
 h attention is a periodic shift symmetry as implemented in axion monodromy 
 inflation. This symmetry leads to resonance non-gaussianities\, whose key f
 eature are logarithmically stretched oscillations. Oscillations are also a 
 generic consequence of excited states during inflation and of sharp feature
 s in the potential. Oscillating shapes are therefore a very interesting exp
 erimental target. \nAfter giving an overview of these motivations\, I will 
 discuss how to search for these signatures in the CMB. Fast oscillations ar
 e difficult to search for with traditional estimation techniques\, and I wi
 ll demonstrate how targeted expansions\, that exploit the symmetry properti
 es of the shapes\, allow to circumvent these difficulties. As a member of t
 he Planck collaboration\, I will discuss the Planck results that have been 
 obtained using these methods in the bispectrum\, as well as related results
  in the power spectrum. Due to their low overlap with other non-gaussian sh
 apes\, oscillating bispectrum shapes are not exhaustively constrained and a
  potential discovery is therefore not yet ruled out.\nMy talk will be based
  in particular on arxiv:1412.3461\, arxiv:1505.05882 and Planck publication

 n\, the model satisfies the observed XRay mass-temperature relation and mim

 calculate Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZE) properties and compare with observations
 . We find nice agreement with the gas pressure profile found by Arnaud et a
 l (2009) and SZE scaling relations observed by Bonamente et al (2008). We a
 lso find gas fraction within r500 increasing with the underlying mas M500\,
  similar to observations.  Going in reverse\, we can constrain the mass-tem
 perature  relation of galaxy clusters by finding the best fitting cluster m
 odel to the Bonamente SZE scaling data. These\, then\, turn out to be in ni
 ce agreement with the observed XRay results. The consistency between the gl
 obal properties of clusters detected in X-Ray’s and in\nSZE shows that we a
 re looking at a common population of clusters as a whole\, and there is no 
 deficit of\nSZE flux relative to expectations from X-Ray scaling properties
 . Moreover\, being analytical in nature\, our model can be easily used for 
 MCMC runs. Finally\, we take a look at the implications for M200 scaling re

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The shortest-period planets</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract
 : The shortest-period exoplanets are not only the most readily detected by 
 transit and radial velocity surveys\, but also offer one of the best benchm
 arks to test models of planet formation and evolution. In fact\, the longes
 t-standing puzzle in exoplanet science began with the discovery of the shor
 test-period gas giants\, the so-called hot Jupiters. First\, I will argue t
 hat most hot Jupiters possibly migrated by weak gravitational interactions 
 with outer giant planets and tides acting on them. The nature of these inte
 ractions is likely imprinted on a population of eccentric planets at the ve
 rge of migration\, and I will discuss a novel mechanism based on the intera
 ctions with a dispersing protoplanetary disk evidenced by a particular exop
 lanet system. Second\, I will take the picture of migration even further to
  explain the origin of a population of shortest-period rocky planets with s
 ub-day orbits revealed by Kepler. I will argue that these planets acquired 
 their tight orbits by weak chaotic interactions\, similar to those driving 
 the long-term orbital evolution of Mercury\; our Solar system's shortest-pe
 riod planet. Finally\, I will discuss how TESS and Gaia together will infor
 m us about the origin of these enigmatic planetary systems.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Testing the Caustic Ring Dark Matter Halo Model Ag
 ainst Observations in the Milky Way </b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: A prediction o
 f axion dark matter models is they can form Bose-Einstein condensates and r
 igid caustic rings as a halo collapses in the non-linear regime. In this ta
 lk\, I will present results from the first study of the caustic ring model 
 for the Milky Way halo (Duffy & Sikivie 2008)\, focusing on observational c
 onsequences. I will describe the formalism for calculating the gravitationa
 l acceleration of a caustic ring halo. The caustic ring dark matter theory 
 reproduces a roughly logarithmic halo\, with large perturbations near the r
 ings. I will show that this halo can reasonably match the known Galactic ro
 tation curve. We explored the effects of dark matter caustic rings on dwarf
  galaxy tidal disruption with N-body simulations. N-body simulations of the
  Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy in a caustic ring halo potential\, with dis
 k and bulge parameters that are tuned to match the Galactic rotation curve\
 , match observations of the Sgr trailing tidal tails as far as 90 kpc from 
 the Galactic center. Like the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo\, they are\, h
 owever\, unable to match the leading tidal tail. None of the caustic\, NFW\
 , or triaxial logarithmic halos are able to simultaneously match observatio
 ns of the leading and trailing arms of the Sagittarius stream. I will furth
 er show that simulations of dwarf galaxies that move through caustic rings 
 are qualitatively similar to those moving in a logarithmic halo. </p>\n<p>H

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Most Matter is Dark Matter\, but that's not all th

  Cold Dark Matter halos reveal huge amounts of substructure\, both in confi

 ma-ray Sky: Predictions and First Observational Results from Fermi-LAT</b><
 /p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Can we use the Fermi satellite like WMAP? In 2006\, S. 
 Ando and I proposed to use anisotropies in the gamma-ray background (not CM
 B!) as a smoking-gun signature of annihilation of dark matter particles in 
 the universe. The idea is simple: since dark matter traces the large-scale 
 structure of the universe\, the emission from dark matter must be anisotrop
 ic\, and its spatial pattern is predictable. The use of anisotropy (especia
 lly the power spectrum) was new to the gamma-ray community\, so I teamed up
  with the Fermi-LAT team to look for this signature. Here\, we report on th
 e first detection of anisotropy in the diffuse gamma-ray background measure
 d by Fermi-LAT. We find that the detected signal is very likely due to unre
 solved blazers. Subtracting this signal\, we can place a fairly stringent u
 pper limit on the residual anisotropy signal\, which would then put constra
 ints on dark matter properties.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Jens Chluba / Mike Nolta

 es in cosmology within the last few decades\, there is still considerable u
 ncertainty as to how the first luminous objects formed during the Epoch of 
 Reionization (EoR). Measuring the 21cm line at the relevant redshifts has b
 een shown to be a promising way to probe this era\, at least in theory. In 
 practice\, such observations are difficult because the cosmological signals
  are expected not only to be extremely faint\, but also to be contaminated 
 by overwhelming bright foreground sources.\n\nIn this talk\, I will focus o
 n a particular flavor of 21cm experiments --- the "global signal" measureme
 nts\, where the 21cm signal is averaged over the entire sky and measured as
  a function of redshift.  I will argue that is difficult (if not impossible
 ) to mitigate foreground contamination without fine angular resolution\, ev
 en though the ultimate goal is a signal averaged over the entire sky.  Usin
 g a combination of simulations and analytic calculations\, I will show that
  with the right data analysis/foreground subtraction techniques\, an experi
 ment with good angular resolution should be able to detect a cosmological 2
 1cm signal at extremely high significance.  This is encouraging news\, for 
 it suggests that even with severe foreground contamination\, it should be p
 ossible to place interesting constraints on the EoR using global 21cm exper
 iments.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Richard Shaw</b></p>

 Analog of Planet Formation in Gravitational Wave Sources</b></p>\n\n<p>Abst
 ract: The prevalence of massive black holes and nuclear stellar clusters im
 plies some stars may be trapped in accretion disks around active galactic n
 uclei.  We determine the star trapping rate and we show that the trapped st
 ars rapidly accrete gas which leads to a top heavy initial mass function si
 milar to that found in the Galactic Center. These massive stars undergo sup
 ernova explosion\, pollute the accretion disks around high-redshift quasars
  to produce super solar metallicity. They also produce single stellar-mass 
 black hole remnants which gain mass through accretion and capture companion
 s.  Binary seed black holes lose angular momentum to the surrounding gas to
  tighten their separation.  They generate intense gravitational wave when t
 hey coalesce. We provide analysis on the distribution of their masses\, mas
 s ratio\, spin rate\, binary orbit-spin obliquity and red-shift-dependent o
 ccurrence rate as observable predictions. I will describe some relevant mec
 hanisms which are analogous to the astrophysics of planet formation and the
  implications of this scenario in the context of 1) coeval population and k
 inematic properties of disk and S stars around the Galactic center\,  2) su
 per solar metallicity\, 3) duty cycle of AGN active phase\, and 4) the rapi

 how that this conformal limit of inflation includes Starobinsky-like inflat

 cursion. In this limit\, all primordial correlators are constrained by the 
 full conformal group. This fixes the power spectrum and the full bispectrum

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Formation of double neutron stars and implications
  for heavy element production</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Observations of DNS s
 ystems in our Galaxy suggest that the formation of the second born NS in mo
 st systems involves a very weak explosion\, rather than a more "traditional
 " SNe. This allows us to estimate the typical center of mass velocities and
  time until merger for double neutron star systems. We find that more than 
 half of the systems are slow enough and merge rapidly enough to be able to 
 account even for the recent observations of r-process elements in ultra-fai
 nt dwarf galaxies. Furthermore\, assuming that the explosion energy is less
  than 10^52 erg and that the galaxies haven't lost most of their gas before
  the r-process event\, we can expect most of the r-process material to be r
 etained even in faint dwarfs. At the same time\, observations of the Eu abu
 ndances in dwarf galaxies lead to model independent estimates of the rate a
 nd mass per event of r-process formation. These suggest rates between 2*10^
 (-4) and 10^(-2) per ccSNe and Eu masses between 10^(-5)M_sun and 2*10^(-4)
 M_sun. Both values rule out regular SNe as the sources of r-process events 
 and are consistent with expectations for the DNS merger hypothesis. Finally
 \, we show that faint dwarf galaxies are consistent with being the 'buildin
 g blocks' of the Galactic halo\, and provide a natural explanation for the 
 mean value and fluctuations in the abundances of Galactic halo metal poor s
 tars.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Carl-Johan Haster</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Interpreting the Orbital Configurations of Exoplan
 et Systems</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The present-day orbital configurations o
 f exoplanet systems hold clues to the physical processes that shaped them d
 uring the planet formation stage. For instance\, mean motion resonances\, o
 rbital configurations in which planets' periods are related by small intege
 r ratios\, can serve as signposts of past migration. I will describe what w
 e can learn about past orbital migration by analyzing systems hosting reson
 ant planets. In other instances\, the interpretation of planetary systems' 
 present-day orbital configurations is confounded by the complexities of  N-
 body dynamics that prevent us from simply rewinding billions of years of or
 bital evolution. In particular\, systems could experience "midlife crises" 
 in which dynamical instabilities reshape their orbital architectures billio
 ns of years after emerging from the protoplanetary disk. There is evidence 
 that such instabilities play an important role in setting the orbital archi
 tectures of compact systems of low-mass planets discovered by transit searc
 hes. But this evidence is limited in part by our incomplete understanding o
 f the causes and consequences of dynamical instabilities. I will discuss re
 cent progress on understanding instabilities in such compact systems and pr
 ospects for better understanding their role in shaping planetary system arc

 t is thought that magnetic fields must be present in the interiors of stars
  to resolve certain discrepancies between theory and observation\, but such
  fields are difficult to detect and characterise. Asteroseismology is a pow
 erful technique for inferring the internal structures of stars by measuring
  their oscillation frequencies\, and succeeds particularly with evolved sta
 rs\, owing to their mixed modes\, which are sensitive to the deep interior.
  In this talk I will present the results of a phenomenological study of the
  combined effects of rotation and magnetism on the seismic properties of ev
 olved stars\, focusing on the regime where Coriolis and Lorentz forces are 
 comparable\, and weak enough that first-order perturbation theory applies. 
 Axisymmetric "twisted-torus" field configurations are used\, which are allo
 wed to be misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. Factors such as the
  field radius\, topology and obliquity are examined. The interplay of rotat
 ion and magnetism is shown to be complex: for example\, nearly symmetric mu
 ltiplets of apparently low multiplicity can arise even under a substantial 
 field\, suggesting the need for proper modelling of rotation and magnetism 
 simultaneously in order to draw robust conclusions about interior propertie
 s. I will also discuss the distinctive signatures of magnetic splitting tha
 t may allow it to be disentangled from rotational splitting\, which may imp
 act future strategies for seismic interpretation of these objects.</p>\n<p>

 sides in a state of moderate dynamical evolution. Galaxies\, intergalactic 
 gas and dark matter exist in a wispy weblike spatial arrangement consisting
  of dense compact clusters\, elongated filaments\, and sheetlike walls\, am
 idst large near-empty void regions. The weblike pattern is marked by promin
 ent anisotropic features\, a distinct multiscale character\, a complex spat
 ial connectivity of its various morphological components and a clear asymme
 try between voids and overdense regions. \n\nThis seminar will describe the
  structure and evolution of physical and population properties of the struc
 tural components of the Cosmic Web. The analysis is based on our Nexus/MMF 
 Multiscale Morphology formalism\, an explicit geometric and multi-scale -- 
 parameter-free and scale-free -- method to identify morphological features 
 in the Cosmic Web. Subsequently\, we introduce the concept of persistent to
 pology as a means to quantify the connectivity of the multiscale matter dis
 tribution. Finally\, we assess the dynamical evolution of the cosmic web by
  in terms of a geometry based computational solution of the adhesion model 
 of cosmic structure formation. It is demonstrated that the concepts of conv
 ex hull and weighted Delaunay and Voronoi tessellations enable an elegant a
 nd efficient evaluation of the dynamical evolution of the cosmic web. We co
 nclude by describing its application to the reconstruction of the Cosmic We
 b in the Local Universe implied by the 2MRS galaxy survey as processed by t

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Non-ideal MHD Effects in Protoplanetary Disks </b>
 </p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks (P
 PDs)largely depend on the process of angular momentum transport\, for which
  MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) has been 
 considered as the most promising mechanism. Due to the weak ionization\nlev
 el in PPDs\, non-ideal MHD effects such as Ohmic resistivity\, Hall effect 
 and ambipolar diffusion (AD) play a significant role. Most MRI calculations
  for PPDs done so far include only the Ohmic resistivity\, and reveal that 
 the MRI operates mainly in the surface layer and the outer regions of the P
 PDs. However\, Hall and AD effects dominate in such regions but remain poor
 ly explored. We perform 3D unstratified shearing-box MRI simulations with A
 D using a variety of magnetic configurations and AD coefficients. We find t
 hat angular momentum transport becomes inefficient\nwhen the ion-neutral co
 llision frequency falls below the orbital frequency. Moreover\, sustained M
 RI turbulence requires weak magnetic field in the AD dominated regime (whic
 h is opposite to the Ohmic dominated regime). These constraints combined to
 gether indicate that MRI alone has difficulty to account for the accretion 
 rate in most T-Tauri stars\, while angular momentum transport by magnetized
  wind may be a viable solution.</p>

 recision calculations in de Sitter space (such as of inflationary predictio
 ns for primordial fluctuations) are often plagued by infrared problems and 
 issues of secular time dependence. Similar issues about the breakdown of pe
 rturbation theory also arise for information loss in black holes. This talk
  briefly summarizes what is known about when these problems do (and do not)
  arise\, and how similar problems are dealt with in other areas (like optic
 s). It is argued that Master-Equation techniques used there also apply to c
 osmology (and possibly black holes) and can tell us how to extract reliably
  late-time predictions. Applied to inflation they lead to Starobinsky's sto
 chastic methods (plus potential corrections). This is argued to provide an 
 explanation for why stochastic inflation seems to resum IR effects in simpl
 e examples\, and allows these tools to be generalized to other systems. I m
 ention in passing the relevance of these tools to the problem of Schrodinge
 's Cosmologist: how primordial fluctuations decohere sometime between their

 neutron star and neutron star-neutron star mergers are powerful emitters of
  gravitational waves\, and can produce a wide range of bright electromagnet
 ic transients. They also provide us with a remarkable environment to study 
 nuclear interactions in the cold\, dense core of neutron stars\, and may si
 gnificantly contribute to the production of many heavy elements whose origi
 n remains unexplained. Given the increasing sensitivity of existing gravita

 gers to be observed in the coming years. In order to extract as much inform
 ation as possible from these observations\, reliable models of the gravitat
 ional wave and electromagnetic signals powered by mergers are necessary. In
  this talk\, I will discuss our efforts to study binary mergers using gener
 al relativistic simulations. I will in particular focus on recently develop
 ed gravitational wave models which account for tidal effects in neutron sta

  matter ejected by neutron star mergers\, and on the outcome of nucleosynth
 esis in that ejecta. Tidal effects in neutron star mergers can provide us w
 ith information about the size of neutron stars\, an important observable i

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The quest to detect extremely-redshifted 21cm radi
 ation</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I will first summarize the status of searches
  for 21cm radiation from z>6.  Most 21cm efforts to date are aimed at detec
 ting the reionization era (z~6-10)\, but two new efforts are targeting the 
 signal from the era of the first stars (z~15-25).  This talk will focus on 
 three theoretical issues that have implications for the detectability of th
 ese signals and for what we will learn when we detect them.  I will discuss
 : (1) what the reionization era observatories will teach us about this epoc
 h\, (2) whether the z~20 Universe shock heated (as has been suggested)\, wh
 ich would eliminate the predicted strong absorption signal that the first s
 tars efforts are targeting\, and (3) whether the recently appreciated baryo
 n-dark matter supersonic velocity difference could result in much larger fl
 uctuations in the 21cm signal. \n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Eric Switzer</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Relativistic orbital resonances and their impact o
 n binary inspiral</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Some strong field black hole orbi
 ts exhibit resonances\, meaning that the frequency of motion associated wit
 h one of the orbit's degrees of freedom is some integer ratio times the fre
 quency associated with another degree of freedom.  Resonances are well know
 n in Newtonian orbital dynamics\, and are responsible for some interesting 
 features of the motion of certain bodies in our solar system.  In relativis
 tic systems\, orbits in which the radial and polar frequencies are in reson
 ance can have an especially strong impact on the inspiral-driven evolution 
 of these binaries.  In this talk\, I will describe the physical mechanism b
 y which resonances affect binary inspiral\, and demonstrate that these effe

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Destructive Birth of Massive Stars and Massive
  Star Clusters</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Massive stars play an essential role
  in the Universe. They are rare\, yet the energy and momentum they inject w
 ith their intense radiation fields and stellar winds into the interstellar 
 medium (ISM) dwarfs the contribution by their vastly more numerous low-mass
  cousins. These mechanisms can halt accretion onto massive stars and limit 
 star formation in massive star clusters (MSCs)\, which can host thousands o
 f massive stars. For stellar winds\, I discuss how we can use observations 
 to constrain a range of kinetic energy loss channels for the shock-heated g
 as from stellar winds in MSCs. I demonstrate that the kinetic energy inject
 ed by stellar winds in MSCs is not a significant contributor to stellar fee
 dback for young MSCs. I argue instead that radiation pressure is likely the
  dominant feedback mechanism in massive star and MSC formation. Therefore d
 etailed simulation of their formation requires an accurate treatment of rad
 iation. For this purpose\, I have developed a new\, highly accurate hybrid 
 radiation algorithm that properly treats the absorption of the direct radia
 tion field from stars and the re-emission and processing by interstellar du
 st. With this new method\, I performed a suite of three-dimensional radiati
 on-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of massive stars and MSCs. For
  individual massive stellar systems\, I find that mass is channeled to the 
 massive stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabili
 ties. I will also present simulations of the formation of a MSC from the co
 llapse of a dense\, turbulent\, magnetized million solar mass molecular clo
 ud. I find that the influence of the magnetic pressure and radiative feedba
 ck slows down star formation. These results suggest that the combined effec
 t of turbulence\, magnetic pressure\, and radiative feedback from massive s
 tars is responsible for the observed low star formation efficiencies in mol
 ecular clouds.</p>\n

 \n\n<p>Abstract: Super Eddington accretion occurs in many systems\, such as
  the inner regions of quasars and luminous AGN\, ultra-luminous X-ray sourc
 es (ULXs)\, and tidal disruption events.  Understanding such flows is impor
 tant not only for interpreting the spectra and variability of these sources
 \, but also to predict the rate of growth of black holes in the early unive
 rse\, and to quantify energy an momentum feedback into the medium surroundi
 ng the black hole\, a process likely to be important in controlling galaxy 
 formation in the case of AGN.  New results from a study of the magnetohydro
 dynamics of luminous accretion flows\, in which radiation pressure dominate
 s\, will be presented. We have developed new numerical methods based on a f
 ormal solution of the time dependent radiation transfer equations to study 
 this regime.  Our numerical simulations reveal new effects that require ext
 ension of standard thin-disk models.  We discuss these results\, and their 
 implications for the astrophysics of accreting black holes.</p>\n<p>Host: <

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>How well does turbulence theory describe the inter

 ellar medium (ISM) includes magnetized multiphase turbulence\, with turbule
 nce affecting many important physical processes including star formation\, 
 cosmic ray acceleration\, and the evolution of ISM structure. The origin an
 d driver of ISM turbulence on large scales (1kpc to 0.1 kpc)  is likely rel

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Care and Feeding of Star Forming Regions</b></
 p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In the local Universe\, all stars form in clouds of mole
 cular gas.  On the largest scales in galaxies\, the ensemble of molecular c
 louds produces a simple star formation law: more molecular gas is linearly 
 correlated with more star formation.  This star formation law must emerge f
 rom behaviour of groups of individual molecular clouds.  In this talk\, I w
 ill present recent observations of molecular clouds and star forming region
 s in our Galaxy.  Using a suite of novel analysis approaches\, we are able 
 to untangle maps of molecular gas and match them to the regions of star for
 mation.  This analysis finds good evidence that significant mass flows are 
 essential for feeding star forming regions across the Galactic disk.  Addit
 ionally\, higher mass molecular clouds show evidence for increased rates of
  star formation\, suggesting again these clouds are fed from their environm
 ent over their lifetime.  The large apparent scatter in the efficiency of t
 he star formation process can be attributed in part to viewing the effects 
 of this mass accretion over time.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Christa Van Laerhoven</b

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b> The Gravitational and Electromagnetic Signatures 
 of Black Hole Mergers</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH
 ) binaries are the primary targets of low-frequency gravitational wave (GW)
  experiments from space and from the ground.  They are expected to be produ
 ced during collisions between galaxies carrying their own nuclear SMBHs.\n\
 nI will argue that compact\, gravitationally bound SMBH binaries should oft
 en be surrounded by plasma and produce bright electromagnetic (EM) emission
 .  Hydrodynamical simulations of BH binaries with circumbinary accretion di
 sks have revealed that the BHs can be fueled efficiently\, with the fueling
  rates quasi-periodically modulated all the way to the BH merger.  The corr
 esponding EM emission is time-variable\, with a periodicity pattern dependi
 ng on the mass ratio of the BHs\, and will contain unique spectral signatur
 es.  A post-merger afterglow is also expected\, following the burst of GWs 
 which drive shocks through the circumbinary plasma.\n\nThese effects may be
  used to identify unique EM counterparts of the GW sources expected to be d
 iscovered by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and by the space interferometer LI
 SA\, and to discover wider binary SMBHs in time-domain EM surveys.  The sim
 ultaneous EM and GW detections of SMBH binaries will enable a range of new 
 science\, from accretion physics to novel tests of gravity and dark energy.
 \n\nIn principle\, many of the above conclusions could also hold for stella
 r-mass BH binaries.  Time permitting\, I will comment on the possibility th
 at some of the BH mergers recently discovered by LIGO/Virgo may have occure
 d in a plasma-rich enviroment of a galactic nucleus\, and possible unique s
 ignatures of this scenario.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Xinyu Li</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Supermassive black hole binaries: a neat multi-mes
 senger source</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMB
 HBs) are natural products of galaxy mergers and promising gravitational wav
 e sources. Living in the gas-rich center of galaxies\, these systems might 
 accrete plasma and emit copious amounts of electromagnetic radiation. But h
 ow do we distinguish a binary from a single black hole in active galactic n
 uclei? Because we cannot spatially resolve these sources\, we need to build
  precise models to identify them in the electromagnetic spectrum. The compl
 ex interplay between the magnetized plasma and the dynamical spacetime can 
 only be fully solved using accurate general relativistic magneto-hydro (GRM
 HD) simulations that span a broad range of scales\, from the black hole hor
 izon to the disk around the binary. In this talk\, I will present our recen
 t work on modeling accretion disks and their emission around SMBHB using a 
 combination of 3D GRMHD simulations\, ray-tracing\, and semi-analytical tec
 hniques. In particular\, I will focus on electromagnetic signatures we migh
 t observe when the black holes are spinning\; in this case\, the system can
  launch powerful double jets and the emission from the disk can be brighter

  dispersing their stars into the Galactic field.  Thus\, GCs contain the fo
 ssil record of a very early episode of star formation in our Galaxy\, and a
 re our only means of studying stellar birthing in the early local Universe.
   In this talk\, we present the results of a suite of Monte Carlo and N-bod
 y simulations for globular cluster (GC) evolution.  The models are used to 
 constrain the parameter space relevant to the formation of the Milky Way GC
  population.  That is\, the set of initial conditions that will evolve dyna
 mically over ~10--12 Gyr to reproduce the presently observed parameters for
  the bulk of the Galactic GC population.  Along with a universal initial st
 ellar mass function\, we assume an universal initial binary fraction near u
 nity with a significant soft component\, combined with initial densities in
  the range $10^4-10^6 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and an initia
 l mass-density relation corresponding to higher densities in initially more
  massive clusters.  These initial conditions are able to simultaneously rep
 roduce the present-day observed structural parameters (concentration\, mean
  density\, total cluster mass\, etc.)\, stellar mass functions and binary f
 ractions (both inside and outside the half-mass radius) for most Galactic G
 Cs.  Our results provide important constraints for simulations of clustered
  star formation in the proto-Milky Way.</p>\n

 \n\n<p>Abstract: Intensity mapping surveys of neutral hydrogen (HI) are a n

  The next generation of radio telescopes and interferometers are being desi

 lution allowing efficient mapping of large volumes. The impact of instrumen
 tal systematics of radio observations on cosmological measurements can be s
 ignificantly reduced by cross-correlating the HI signal with galaxy surveys
 . The cross-correlation also offers an innovative way to statistically dete

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Resonance Capture in Planetary Systems and Beyond<
 /b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: An important development in our understanding of pl
 anet formation has been the realization that planets often migrate after th
 eir initial assembly in the proto-planetary disk. Mean motion resonances (M
 MRs)\, orbital configurations where planets’ orbital periods are related by
  small-integer ratios\, provide one important line of evidence for this orb
 ital migration. These configurations are naturally produced when dissipativ
 e effects such as planet-disk interactions cause planets’ orbits to migrate
  towards one another. I’ll review a basic dynamical model for this resonanc
 e capture process and highlight what one can learn about past orbital migra
 tion from the present-day resonant configurations of planetary systems. Thi
 s basic dynamical model also describes capture of stellar orbits into Linbl
 ad resonances so I will (attempt to) draw analogies to galactic dynamics an
 d speculate about potential applications of this model in a galactic contex

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Finding Dark Galaxies From Tidal Imprints</b></p>\
 n\n<p>Abstract: Characterizing the ubiquitous dark matter in the universe h
 as proven to be one of the most challenging problems in modern astrophysics
 . If the dynamical impact of dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies on the ou
 tskirts of galactic disks can be deciphered\, we may be able to infer and c
 haracterize cold dark matter sub-structure in a fundamentally new way. I sh
 ow how one can analyze observed disturbances in the outer gas disks of spir
 al galaxies to quantitatively characterize galactic companions without requ
 iring knowledge of their optical light. This method\, which I call "Tidal A
 nalysis"\, allows one to determine the mass and relative position (in radiu
 s and azimuth) of galactic companions purely from analysis of observed dist
 urbances in gas disks. I will first demonstrate the validity of this method
  by applying it to local spirals with known optical companions to provide a
  proof of principle. I will then review my earlier work on the Milky Way th
 at prompted the development of this method. Specifically\, analysis of obse
 rved disturbances on the outskirts of the Milky Way disk favor a 1:100 mass
  ratio perturber with a close pericentric approach. I will conclude by disc
 ussing ongoing work on developing scaling relations between observed HI map
 s and satellite mass\, and our plans for the near-future which include test
 ing the Tidal Analysis method on large samples to determine its statistical
  viability.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Phil Chang</b></p>

 ar merger (GW170817)\, and in the subsequent hours\, days and weeks\, an un
 precedented electromagnetic follow-up campaign resulted in detections acros
 s all wavebands from gamma-rays through to radio. This event has led to new
  results on a wide range of topics: from heavy element production in the Un
 iverse\, to independent measurements of the Hubble Constant\, to the origin
  of short gamma-ray bursts.\n\nAfter 16 days of intensive monitoring\, radi
 o emission was detected by the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA)\, and confirm
 ed by our team with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This was the fir
 st radio emission to be associated with gravitational wave events\, and una
 mbiguously associated with a binary neutron star merger. The radio emission
  we expected to see was a late-time afterglow\, detectable months to years 
 after the event as the shock travels out into the interstellar medium. Howe
 ver\, what we detected was an entirely different phenomenon\, most likely a
  cocoon of ejecta material breaking out from the explosion and interacting 
 with the interstellar medium. With only one event observed\, we currently h
 ave no way of knowing whether this is atypical\, or the first of a new\, in
 triguing\, class of transient radio source.\n\nI will present our latest re
 sults from radio monitoring of GW170817 and our plans and recent results fr
 om radio follow-up of gravitational wave events in LIGO O3 and beyond.</p>\

  flux of energetic charged particles which bombards the upper layers of Ear
 th’s atmosphere – many questions remain still open on its origin\, nature a
 nd transport. The precise measurement of the cosmic-ray ion flux aims to st
 udy the acceleration and propagation processes. In particular\, the measure
 ment of secondary-to-primary ratios allows to constrain propagation models 
 very effectively due to its direct dependency to the grammage seen by the p
 articles during their transport. The knowledge and the characterisation of 
 the processes related to the propagation make it possible to reconstruct th
 e cosmic-ray source spectrum and thus to constrain the acceleration process
 es\, but also to test the existence of exotic contributions such as the ann
 ihilation of dark-matter particles. My work treats two aspects of cosmic-ra
 y physics: the phenomenology and the detection. Concerning the phenomenolog
 ical aspect\, the work presented here consists in evaluating and studying t
 he constraints on galactic cosmic-ray propagation models provided by curren
 t measurements using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The experimental aspect of
  this work concerns the participation in the construction\, the validation 
 and the data analysis of the CherCam subdetector – a Cherkov imager measuri
 ng the charge of cosmic-ray ions for the CREAM experiment – whose prelimina

 stronger than had been expected from the low-frequency "tail" of the therma

 MB studies\, it presents a significant "foreground" that CMB observers woul
 d like to remove.\n\nIn 1998 it was proposed that the AME was rotational em
 ission from ultrasmall dust grains with rotational frequencies of 15-50 GHz
 .  The population of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) responsible fo
 r strong infrared emission bands between 3.3 and 17um were natural candidat
 es for the emitter.  This "spinning dust" hypothesis appeared to be a very 
 natural explanation for the AME\, and was supported by upper limits on pola
 rization of the AME.\n\nI will describe recent observational efforts to dem

  not support the conjectured AME-PAH linkage.  Other possibilities for the

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>New ideas in stellar magnetism\, and the magnetoro
 tational instability</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms b
 ehind solar magnetism remains one of the longest-standing unsolved problems
  in physics. Despite an impressive history of observations\, from Galileo's
  early drawings of sunspots to the trove of recent data coming from the Sol
 ar Dynamics Observatory\, no one understands how the sun's global magnetic 
 dynamo \nmachine operates. Over the last few decades theories have risen an
 d fallen and creative new ideas are needed to make progress. In this talk\,
  I will present a new model for dynamics within the sun's outer layers. It 
 is based on the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and\, surprisingly\, c
 orresponds to the dynamics of a buckling elastic beam \nunder an applied lo
 ad. This very simple reduced model can possibly help us understand two phen
 omena that strongly resist explanation to date: (i) the saturation of the M
 RI via flux and momentum conservation principles\, and (ii) the migration o
 f the equator branch of the solar torsional oscillation pattern\, which cor
 relates highly with sunspot migration.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Shane Davis</b></

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Cosmology and Astrophysics of the Twin Higgs</b></
 p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The Twin Higgs model is an attractive solution to the li
 ttle Hierarchy problem with top partners that are neutral under SM gauge ch
 arges. The framework is consistent with the null result of LHC colored top 
 partner searches while offering many alternative discovery channels. Depend
 ing on model details\, the phenomenology looks very different: either spect
 acular long-lived particle signals at colliders\, or a plethora of unusual 
 cosmological and astrophysical signatures via the existence of a predictive
  hidden sector. I will examine the latter possibility\, and describe how th
 e asymmetrically reheated Mirror Twin Higgs provides a predictive framework
  for a highly motivated and highly non-trivial interacting dark sector\, wi
 th correlated signals in the CMB\, Large Scale Structure\, and direct detec
 tion searches\, as well as higgs precision measurements at colliders. This 
 provides a vivid example of the collider-cosmology complementarity\, and mo
 tivates a variety of new astrophysical searches\, including the search for 
 X-ray point sources from Mirror Stars\, that are motivated by the hierarchy
  problem.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Simon Foreman</b></p>

 ract: Although dark matter comprises the vast majority of the matter in the

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Transient resonances in extreme mass ratio inspira
 ls</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The two body problem in general relativity\, in 
 the highly relativistic\,\nextreme mass-ratio regime for spinning black hol
 es has a qualitatively new\nfeature which is not seen in the weak-field lim
 it: the effects of\ntransient resonances. These resonances occur when the r
 atio of polar and\nradial orbital frequencies\, which is slowly evolving un
 der the influence\nof gravitational radiation reaction\, passes through a l
 ow order rational\nnumber. At such points\, the adiabatic approximation to 
 the orbital\nevolution breaks down\, and there is a brief but order unity c
 orrection to\nthe inspiral rate.\nThe effects of resonances make orbits mor
 e sensitive to changes in initial\ndata and give rise to corrections to the
  gravitational wave signal's phase\nwhich scale as the square root of the i
 nverse of mass of the small body\,\nand thus become large in the extreme-ma
 ss-ratio limit\, dominating over all\nother post-adiabatic effects. Our res
 ults apply to an important potential\nsource of gravitational waves\, the g
 radual inspiral of compact objects\ninto much more massive black holes. It 
 is hoped to exploit observations of\nthese sources to map the spacetime geo
 metry of black holes. However\, such\nmapping will require accurate models 
 of binary dynamics\, which is a\ncomputational challenge whose difficulty i
 s significantly increased by\nresonance effects. From numerically evolving 
 fully relativistic orbital\ndynamics supplemented with an approximate\, pos
 t-Newtonian self-force\, we estimate that the resonance phase shifts will b
 e of order a few tens of\ncycles for mass ratios $\\sim 10^{-6}$.\n</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Astro-Environmentalism in the NewSpace Era</b></p>
 \n\n<p>Abstract: The early adoption of the Big Sky paradigm has led\, in pa
 rt\, to the current unsustainable development of space\, most clearly seen 
 in Earth’s orbital environment through the accumulation of debris. The rise
  of commercial space activity and the increasing accessibility of space may
  only exacerbate unsustainable practices.  To complicate matters further\, 
 humans are poised to dramatically change our uses of space by (1) expanding
  activity on and around the Moon (through the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gatewa
 y and many proposed commercial missions) and (2) by extracting resources fr
 om celestial bodies\, including near-Earth asteroids.  Unless steps are tak
 en to guide the development of these new domains\, human activity could uni
 ntentionally destroy pristine scientific material\, create entirely new str
 essors on the debris environment around Earth\, create new debris environme
 nts in lunar and cis-lunar space\, and/or even endanger the global populati
 on.  The Outer Space Institute (OSI) was recently founded to address such c
 hallenges through transdisciplinary work on topics related to the sustainab
 le development of space\, with a focus on space debris and space mining. Th
 e organization includes perspectives from scientists\, policy makers\, inte
 rnational lawyers\, and current space industry and NewSpace business advoca
 tes.  \n\nBroadly\, in this talk I will give a brief overview of some of th
 e technical and legal challenges of space use in the NewSpace era and how s
 olutions can be informed through planetary science and astronomy.  As an ex
 ample\, I will discuss motivations for asteroid mining\, as well as nationa
 l efforts to write new legislation to clarify (domestically) the legality o
 f asteroid mining under current international law.  I will then highlight p
 otential unintended consequences of unrestricted access to space resources.
  Two consequences of particular focus will be the generation of new asteroi
 d debris streams and the potential for asteroid redirection as a result of 
 human activity. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Alysa Obertas</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The large-scale distribution of gas</b></p>\n\n<p>
 Abstract: The circumgalactic medium contains signatures of key processes in
  galaxy formation such as gas accretion and outflow and may account for the
  majority of baryons in the Universe. To probe gas in this environment\, we
  measure the mean absorption induced by galaxy halos using all available qu
 asar-galaxy pairs in the SDSS (of the order of several million). This metho
 d does not require the detection of individual absorber systems but is able
  to extract weak absorption signals below the noise of individual spectra. 
 As a result\, we can measure the radial distribution of gas with an unprece
 dented sensitivity\, reaching rest equivalent width of 0.0001 Angstrom. We 
 are able to measure Ca II absorption up to 200 kpc around galaxies and Mg I
 I up to 20 Mpc. We also extract relationships between galaxy properties (st
 ellar mass\, SFR\, orientation) and the amount of gas in their halos. On th
 e large scale\, the measured galaxy-gas correlation function reveals a clea
 r transition from the 1-halo to 2-halo regime which we study quantitatively
  with a new dark matter-gas halo model. We also measure the velocity disper
 sion of cool gas clouds in the halo and interpret it in the cosmological co
 ntext. I will further discuss the new constraints these results bring to th
 e physics of gaseous halos.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Richard Shaw</b></p>

 p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Over the past decade\, a variety of observations have so
 lidified the evidence for cosmic acceleration. In the next decade\, many la
 rge surveys of the Universe will advance the traditional probes of accelera
 tion and bring to prominence new methods for testing models of dark energy 
 and modified gravity. I will review the main observational tools we have fo

 on acoustic oscillations\, and weak lensing. I will show how the predicted 
 constraints on dark energy and modified gravity parameters depend on survey
  characteristics and theoretical assumptions. There are many routes to obta

 low us to explore the unknown territory more effectively than others\, in g

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Geodesically Complete Analytic Solutions to a Cycl
 ic Universe</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I will present analytic solutions to a 
 class of cosmological models described by a canonical scalar field minimall
 y coupled to gravity and experiencing self interactions through a hyperboli
 c potential. Using models and methods  inspired by 2T-physics\, I will show
  how analytic solutions can be obtained including radiation and spacial cur
 vature. Among the analytic solutions\, there are many interesting geodesica
 lly complete cyclic solutions\, both singular and non-singular ones. Cyclic
  cosmological models provide an alternative to inflation for solving the ho
 rizon and flatness problems as well as generating scale-invariant perturbat
 ions. I will argue in favor of the geodesically complete solutions as being
  more attractive for constructing a more satisfactory model of cosmology. W
 hen geodesic completeness is imposed\, it restricts models and their parame
 ters to certain a parameter subspace\, including some quantization conditio
 ns on parameters. I will explain the theoretical origin of our model from t
 he point of view of 2T-gravity as well as from the point of view of the col
 liding branes scenario. If time permits\, I will discuss how to associate s
 olutions of the quantum Wheeler-deWitt equation with the classical analytic
  solutions\, physical aspects of some of the cyclic solutions\, and outline
  future directions\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>tbd</b></p>

 n\n<p>Abstract: Neutrinos remain one of the more elusive particles in the S
 tandard Model of particle physics. Many of neutrino properties including ab
 solute mass\, hierarchy and chirality are difficult to be determined by ter
 restrial experiments. Cosmological observations can provide constraints on 
 the sum of neutrino masses by measuring small-scale matter power spectrum s
 uppression arising from the neutrino free-streaming effect. However\, the c
 hallenge is to disentangle the small neutrino effect from the complex and p
 oorly understood baryonic physics\, especially when the power spectrum shap
 e information is included in the analysis. I will discuss a new effect from
  the relative velocity of dark matter and neutrino fluids which is measurab
 le from the cross correlation of different cosmological fields. The new met
 hod is not affected by most systematics which are parity even and not limit
 ed by the knowledge of optical depth to the cosmic microwave background\, r
 endering it a new promising probe of neutrino properties.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>

 hat can make multiple images of\, and substantially magnify\, sources at co
 smological distances. Individual stars in distant lensed galaxies can be de
 tected as they cross the caustics of lensing clusters. Motivated by the rec

  smooth cluster lenses. I will then show how even a tiny mass fraction of m
 icrolenses inevitably disrupts the smooth cluster caustic into a network of
  corrugated micro-caustics\, and produces light curves with numerous peaks 
 over the timescales of typical observations. Caustic crossing events are ex
 quisitely sensitive to granularity in the mass distribution in the outskirt
 s of galaxy clusters\, and are thus powerful probes of the population of in
 tracluster stars\, and the nature of dark matter.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Aaron</b

 ins one of the chief unresolved problems in galaxy formation. Intermediate 
 mass black holes (IMBHs)\, thought to be the 'missing link' between stellar
  and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are believed to play an dominant role

 of galaxies. In so doing\, it is found that a significant fraction of high-

  phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity\, where the gravitatio

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Circumbinary planet and gas dynamics</b></p>\n\n<p
 >Abstract: One of the puzzles of circumbinary planets is that none of the s
 tellar binaries currently known to host planets has a period shorter than 7
  days\, despite the large number of eclipsing binaries found in the Kepler 
 target list with periods shorter than a few days. These compact binaries ar
 e believed to have evolved from wider orbits into their current configurati
 ons via the so-called Lidov-Kozai migration mechanism\, in which gravitatio
 nal perturbations from a distant tertiary companion induce large-amplitude 
 eccentricity oscillations in the binary\, followed by orbital decay and cir
 cularization due to tidal dissipation in the stars. I will show results of 
 the orbital evolution of planets around binaries undergoing orbital decay a
 nd show that planets subject to this dramatic change in orbital configurati
 on have chances of surviving. Another puzzle\, still unresolved\, is that o
 f the origin of the planet-hosting binaries themselves\, including their po
 orly understood accretion history during the circumbinary disk stage.  I wi
 ll discuss new results from numerical simulations using moving-mesh hydrody
 namics\, in which accretion onto the individual stars can be directly compu
 ted\, showing an interplay between binary eccentricity\, disk eccentricity 
 and accretion rates.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Cristobal Petrovich</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Dead discs and unstable accretion bursts: magnetos
 pheric accretion at low luminosities</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: It has commonl
 y been assumed that accretion onto a magnetosphere is inhibited at low accr
 etion rates\, due to the centrifugal barrier presented by the star (the so-
 called 'propeller' regime). However\, recent work has demonstrated that at 
 low accretion rates a large amount of mass can remain confined in the disc\
 , creating a 'dead disc' that extracts angular momentum from the star witho
 ut accreting or ejecting a significant amount of mass. These 'dead discs' o
 ften become unstable\, initiating cycles of accretion onto the central obje
 ct. I will present the main predictions of this model\, and demonstrate how
  it may be relevant for stars with strong magnetic fields accreting from di
 scs. In neutron stars\, it may explain the peculiar 1Hz quasi-periodic osci
 llations seen in the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars SAX J1808.8-3658 a

 dies in orbit beyond Neptune\, referred to collectively as trans-Neptunian 
 objects (TNOs). These bodies are understood to be the remnants of a much la
 rger initial planetesimal population that was dramatically sculpted by dyna

 eptune\, have driven varying degrees of orbital evolution over the ensuing 
 billions of years. Many TNOs are on highly eccentric orbits. This makes the
 ir dynamical evolution difficult to describe by classical methods of celest
 ial mechanics. I will describe a new mapping approach for modelling the dyn
 amics of these highly eccentric TNOs. This mapping approach furnishes an an

 ub-halos. While massive sub-halos take the form of satellite galaxies\, the
  majority of the predicted sub-halo population remains unaccounted for as s
 ub-halos do not contain luminous matter\, challenging our understanding of 
 dark matter and galaxy formation. Traditional methods for searching for sub
 structure (modelling tidal streams\, gravitational lensing) have been unabl

 in the properties of dark matter substructure and validate the use of tidal

  while conserving the internal distribution. Using the recent data from Gai

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Fast and accurate primordial hydrogen recombinatio
 n theory</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Cosmological hydrogen recombination has re
 cently been the subject of renewed attention because of its importance for 
 predicting the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. 
 Correctly interpreting the upcoming data from the Planck satellite in terms
  of cosmological parameters indeed requires sub-percent accuracy in theoret
 ical recombination histories. Two aspects are crucial to reach such an accu
 racy. At early times (z >~800)\, the dynamics of hydrogen recombination is 
 controlled by the slow decays from the n=2 shell to the ground state\, thro
 ugh two-photon decays from the 2s state and the highly self-absorbed Lyman 
 alpha transition. Subtle radiative transfer effects must be accounted for i
 n order to correctly calculate the rate of decays to the ground state of hy
 drogen. At late times\, due to the decreasing abundance of free electrons a
 nd protons\, an accurate recombination history must account for all the rec
 ombination pathways\, and include excited states of hydrogen up to a very h
 igh principal quantum number n > 100. The cold radiation field at late time
 s is not strong enough to maintain the angular momentum substates in statis
 tical equilibrium\, and they must therefore be followed separately. The tra
 ditional method of solution for the multi-level atom is very time consuming
  computationally and unpractical for inclusion in fast Markov chains for co
 smological parameter estimation. In this talk I will present my recent work
  on a new method of solution\, which allows to account for an arbitrarily l
 arge number of excited states\, and is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster th
 an the previously used method. I will also expose my recent work on radiati
 ve transfer effects and my current work on a fast and highly accurate recom
 bination code. \n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Jens Chluba</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Microphysics of Cosmic-ray Feedback</b></p>\n\
 n<p>Abstract: Cosmic-rays (CRs) are an important constituent of the interst
 ellar medium and likely provide crucial dynamical feedback to their host ga
 laxies and the corresponding circumgalactic medium. Besides providing press
 ure support and being naturally buoyant that tend to escape\, the key micro
 physics in CR feedback lies in the gyro-resonant CRs streaming instabilitie
 s (CRSI). However\, existing global simulations of CR feedback at galactic 
 scales generally rely on highly simplified approximations of the CR physics
 \, and may yield dramatically different results depending on the prescripti
 on employed. I will describe the first numerical studies of the CRSI from f
 irst principles at microscopic level. CRs streaming through background magn
 etic fields makes Alfv\\’en waves unstable when the bulk streaming speed ex
 ceeds the Alfv\\’en velocity. The subsequent wave growth scatters CRs via q
 uasi-linear diffusion\, and eventually isotropizes the CRs in the wave fram
 e. This process leads to momentum exchange between CRs and background fluid
 \, and is the key behind CR-driven outflows. The long-term goal of this stu
 dy is to provide reliable subgrid models for future studies of CR feedback 
 at galactic scales.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>JJ Zanazzi</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Numerical modeling of galactic disks: Non-equilibr
 ium processes and implications to disk evolution</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I 
 will discuss the dynamical evolution of galactic disks resulting from inter
 nal instabilities such as central bars and spiral density waves. Near reson
 ances\, these perturbations can create small-scale structure in phase space
 \, such as the moving groups seen in the solar neighborhood. Moreover\, I w
 ill show that coupling among multiple\nnon-axisymmetric patterns may be ubi
 quitous in disk galaxies\, resulting in a very strong effect on the disk mo
 rphology and chemical evolution. I will demonstrate that the stochastic rad
 ial migration resulting from the resonance overlap of such multiple pattern
 s can flatten metallicity gradients\, extend galactic disk profiles\, and c
 reate thick disk components in both Milky-Way-size and low-mass systems. Th
 e timescale of all these processes is 1-2 Gyr\, which is drastically shorte
 r than previously expected and thus puts strong constraints on the longevit
 y\, strength and pattern speeds of the Milky Way bar and spiral structure.\

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Weak Lensing Magnification - A New Window to Cosmo
 logy</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is a unique to
 ol to study the large-scale mass distribution of the universe since it is s
 ensitive to both\, visible and dark matter (DM). So far\, the large-scale s
 tructure has been mainly studied through WL by employing its shear effect. 
 In this talk I will present a new\, complementary method based on the magni
 fication effect of WL. We measure the cross-correlation functions of backgr
 ound Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected from the CFHTLS to foreground len
 ses selected by accurate photo-z's. The amplitude and shape of the signal d
 epend on cosmology and on the luminosity function of the LBGs\, and we show
  that our measurements agree very well with theoretical expectations. Upcom
 ing measurements on the CFHTLS-Wide data set will yield the first cosmologi
 cal constraints from WL magnification. Furthermore\, we study the magnitude
 -shift effect of magnification from the same data which will be used to est
 imate the profiles of the DM- and dust-halos of galaxies out to z~1.\n \n

 celerate tidal evolution\, especially when such resonances are maintained b
 y a resonance locking mechanism. This process can explain observations of t
 idally excited pulsations in heartbeat stars and the rapid observed migrati
 on of Saturn's moons. In the late phase evolution of massive stars approach
 ing core-collapse\, vigorous convection excites gravity waves that can redi
 stribute huge amounts of energy and angular momentum within the star. I wil
 l present preliminary models of this process\, showing how wave energy redi
 stribution can drive outbursts and enhanced mass loss in the final years of
  massive star evolution\, with important consequences for the appearance of
  subsequent supernovae.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Xinyu</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Characterizing Planetary Populations with Kepler a
 nd Future Exoplanet Surveys</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: For centuries\, planet 
 formation theories were fine tuned to explain the details of solar system. 
  The diversity of planetary systems uncovered by Doppler surveys challenged
  previous theories and led to insights into planet formation\, orbital migr
 ation and the excitation of orbital eccentricities and inclinations.  NASA'
 s Kepler mission has identified over a thousand systems with multiple trans
 iting planet candidates\, including many small and potentially rocky planet
 s.  These planets are enabling scientists to characterize the distribution 
 of planetary properties and the architectures of planetary systems.  In add
 ition\, transit timing variations (TTVs) provide an excellent tool to chara
 cterize the masses and orbits of dozens of small planets\, including many a
 t orbital periods beyond the reach of both Doppler surveys and photoevapora
 tion-induced atmospheric loss.  Dynamical modeling of these systems has ide
 ntified some "supper-puffy" planets\, i.e.\, low mass planets with surprisi
 ngly large radii and low densities.  These discoveries challenge traditiona
 l planet formation theories and invite a new framework for understanding pl
 anet formation.  I will describe some of the challenges in interpreting the
 se discoveries properly and how recent advances in statistical methodology 
 can overcome these challenges.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Dan Tamayo</b></p>

 umerical relativity simulations of black hole mergers</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstrac
 t: GW150914 was the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary bl
 ack hole merger\, bringing us into the era of gravitational wave astronomy.
  From such gravitational wave detections\, we can put constraints on deviat
 ions from general relativity (GR)\, as well as measure the masses and spins
  of the black holes involved in the merger. Such measurements require knowl
 edge of the gravitational waveforms predicted by GR for all relevant masses
  and spins. Numerical relativity (NR) simulations are now sufficiently robu
 st that we can accurately simulate binary black hole mergers and obtain the
  waveform for all but the most extreme parameters\, but they are too comput
 ationally expensive for a dense coverage of the parameter space. The effect
 ive-one-body model and phenomenological waveform models agree well with NR 
 for the parameters of GW150914\, but could be insufficiently accurate for e
 stimating the parameters of a loud gravitational wave detection in other re
 gions of the parameter space. NR surrogate models attempt to rapidly and ac
 curately interpolate the waveforms from a set of NR simulations over a subs
 et of parameter space. Using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC)\, we have bu
 ilt NR surrogate models for non-spinning binaries with mass ratios up to 10
 \, and for spinning precessing binaries with a restricted spin direction on
  the smaller black hole. They typically perform an order of magnitude bette
 r than other waveform models when compared to NR waveforms which were not i
 ncluded in the surrogate training set\, and can be used in gravitational wa
 ve parameter estimation.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The origin of Saturn's rings</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstrac
 t: Orbital perturbations from close flybys through the ring plane during Ca
 ssini’s Grand Finale mission in 2017 determine a total mass of the rings eq
 ual to 60% the mass of Mimas - an unexpectedly small value that supports th
 eories of a recent formation time for the rings.  I'll briefly review compe
 ting theories for the origin of Saturn's rings in light of the constraints 
 from the rings' mass\, age and composition derived from observations and dy
 namical arguments.  I'll present some new results that show how the disrupt
 ion of an icy moon in a collision with an interloping comet a few hundred m
 illion years ago is a simple way to create Saturn's rings.  A ring parent m
 oon with a mass comparable to Mimas could be trapped in mean motion resonan
 ce with Enceladus and Dione in an orbit near the current outer edge of the 
 rings just beyond the Roche zone. I describe some collisional N-body simula
 tions of cometary impacts that lead to the partial disruption of a differen
 tiated moon with a rocky core and icy mantle. The core can survive largely 
 intact while the debris from the mantle settles into a ring of predominantl
 y ice particles straddling the orbital radius of the parent moon. The nasce
 nt ring spreads radially due to collisional viscosity while mass re-accrete
 s onto the remnant rocky core to form a new moon that can be identified as 
 Mimas. The icy debris that migrates into the Roche zone evolves into Saturn
 's ring system.  Torques from tidal interaction with Saturn and resonant in
 teractions with the rings push the recently formed Mimas outward to its cur
 rent position on the same timescale of a few hundred million years. This sc
 enario accounts for the high ice fraction observed in Saturn's rings and ex
 plains why the ring mass is comparable to the mass of Mimas. The prior exis
 tence of a ring parent moon in mean motion resonance results in a tidal hea
 ting rate for Enceladus in the recent past that is significantly larger tha
 n the current rate.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>General equation of state Riemann solvers and thei
 r application</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Equation of state (EoS) plays an impo
 rtant role in computational (astro-)physics. Solving the hydrodynamic equat
 ions together with the equation of state is usually challenging. We propose
  an efficient Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC) general EoS Riemann solver
  that could approximately solve the Euler equations and the EoS under the a
 ssumption of local thermal equilibrium simultaneously. To justify the new H
 LLC general EoS Riemann solver\, we also develop an exact general EoS Riema
 nn solver that can work with non-convex EoS. By applying Godunov scheme to 
 the new HLLC general EoS Riemann solver\, we compare its solutions to the s
 olution of exact Riemann solver and confirm that the approximate solution a
 pproaches the exact solution as we increase the resolution. We also confirm
  that the general EoS Riemann solvers can be reduced to the original EoS Ri
 emann solver if a perfect gas EoS is given to the general EoS Riemann solve
 rs. We propose two methods to solve the EoS\, one is to interpolated 2D EoS
  tables with the bi-linear interpolation method and the other is to calcula
 te the thermodynamic variables at run-time. The interpolation method is mor
 e general as it can work with other monotone and realistic EoS while the an
 alytic EoS solver introduced here works with a relatively idealized EoS. Nu
 merical results confirm that the accuracy of the two EoS solvers is similar
 . We study the efficiency of these two methods with the HLLC general EoS Ri
 emann solver and find that analytic EoS solver is faster in the test proble
 ms. However\, we point out that a combination of the two EoS solvers may be
 come favorable in some specific problems. In this research\, we use ideal g
 as that consists of H2\, HI\, HII\, and e- as an example of realistic gas. 
 At last\, we apply the HLLC general EoS Riemann solver with analytic EoS so
 lver to the dust-driven asymptotic-giant-branch wind problem in 1D. We find
  that the light-curve of the AGB star can be significantly different from t
 he one that uses polytropic gas.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Katie Breivik</b></p>

  has become a key goal of star formation astronomy. The transition from pre
 stellar core to first hydrostatic core (FHSC) or protostar\, while clearly 
 a vital step in the process of star formation\, has not been well studied o
 bservationally due to the short lifetime of the FHSC stage\, difficulties i
 n establishing the relative evolutionary stage of objects\, the small spati

  high densities. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ob
 servations of the submillimeter dust continuum and H2D+ toward two evolved\
 , potentially protostellar cores within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud\, Oph
 A-SM1 and SM1N. The data reveal singular small-scale condensations within b
 oth cores\, with effective radii ~ 40 AU and 400 AU\, and maximum masses M 
 < 0.02 MSun. We find no evidence for substructure in either source\, and a 
 Jeans analysis indicates they are unlikely to thermally fragment\, suggesti
 ng both cores will form single stars. These data reveal observationally the
  earliest stages of the formation of circumstellar accretion regions\, and 
 indicate disk formation can occur very early in the star formation process\
 , coeval with or just post the formation of a first hydrostatic core or pro
 tostar.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Quang Nguyen</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Towards an Empirical Understanding of Gas Accretio
 n and Star Formation in Galaxies</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The most fascinati
 ng aspect of nearby galaxies is the intricately\ninterwoven system of corre
 lations between their global  properties.  These\ncorrelations form the bas
 is of the so-called "scaling laws"\, which are\nfundamental because they pr
 ovide a quantitative means of characterizing\nthe physical properties of ga
 laxies and their systematics.  Theoreticians\ncurrently enjoy a rich and di
 verse array of scaling laws that describe the\nstellar components of galaxi
 es.  Very few well-established scaling laws\nexist describing how the cold 
 gas is correlated with the other global\nphysical properties of galaxies.  
 This constitutes a serious deficiency\nin our knowledge\, because the gas i
 s the reservoir of material out of\nwhich stars are forming at the present 
 day. As such\, the gas ought to be\nmuch more sensitively linked to formati
 on processes (e.g.  accretion)\nthat are occurring now\, rather than integr
 ated over timescales of many\ngigayears\, as is the case for the stars.\n\n
 In my talk\, I will describe a two-pronged approach for\ntackling this prob
 lem: 1) Theoretical: we are extending existing\nsemi-analytic models of gal
 axy formation  to model how the condensed\nbaryons in disk galaxies are par
 titioned between atomic gas\, molecular\ngas and  stars and to characterize
  the cold gas scaling properties of\ngalactic disks  2) Observational: I wi
 ll describe two large programs at\nArecibo and at the IRAM 30m telescope to
  measure accurate and homogeneous HI\nand molecular gas masses for unbiased
  samples of galaxies drawn from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. I will discu
 ss how these surveys are turning\nup galaxies that are caught in the act  o
 f forming their\ndisks at the present day.</p>

 s of binary millisecond pulsars (bMSPs) have allowed us to conclude that ne
 utron stars (NSs) have a wide range of masses spanning from at least 1.17 t
 o 2.0 Msun. However\, we still do not know the upper limit to the mass that
  can be accreted by a neutron star and why the mass-transfer process that l

 cribe some of the evolutionary pathways that lead to the formation of recyc
 led pulsars and\, in particular\, bMSPs. I will show that X-ray irradiation
  feedback during the accretion phase of the formation of bMSPs can cause qu
 asi-periodic episodes of highly non-conservative mass transfer that strongl
 y attenuate mass accretion by the NSs.  This results in the formation of bM
 SPs with greatly reduced masses than would have otherwise been expected fro
 m fully conservative mass transfer and leads to a much more robust agreemen
 t with observations. Most importantly\, we demonstrate that our model has v
 ery little impact on the long-term\, secular-average evolution of the low/i
 ntermediate-mass X-ray binary systems that are the progenitors of bMSPs.</p

 as Exotic Stellar Engine</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Stellar evolution from a p
 rotostar to neutron star is of one of the best\nstudied subjects in modern 
 astrophysics. Yet\, it appears that there is still\na lot to learn about th
 e extreme conditions where the fundamental particle physics meets\nstrong g
 ravity regime. After all of the thermonuclear fuel is spent\, and\nafter th
 e supernova explosion\, but before the remaining mass crosses its own\nSchw
 arzschild radius\, the temperature of the central core of the star might\nb
 ecome higher than the electroweak symmetry restoration temperature. The\nso
 urce of energy\, which can at least temporarily balance gravity\, are baryo
 n\nnumber violating instanton processes which are basically unsuppressed at
 \ntemperatures above the electroweak scale. We constructed a solution to th
 e\nOppenheimer-Volkoff equation which describes such a star. The energy rel
 ease\nrate is enormous at the core\, but gravitational redshift and the enh
 anced\nneutrino interaction cross section at these densities make the energ
 y\nrelease rate moderate at the surface of the star. The lifetime of this n
 ew\nquasi-equilibrium can be more than ten million years\, which is long en
 ough\nto represent a new stage in the evolution of a star.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Evolution of Circumbinary Disks Following Super-ma

 nterest in electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave signals. Of p
 articular interest here\, are counterparts to gravitational wave signals fr
 om super-massive black hole mergers. We consider a circumbinary disk\, holl
 owed out by torques from the binary\, and provide an analytic solution to i
 ts response following merger. There are two changes to the potential which 
 occur during the merger process: an axisymmetric mass-energy loss and asymm
 etric recoil kick given to the resulting super-massive black hole. With a b
 rief literature search we argue that\, for fiducial disk values and for bla
 ck hole spins aligned and anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum\, 
 throughout the majority of parameter space the mass loss well dominates the
  effects of the recoil kicks on the circumbinary disk. This\, along with as
 suming vertical hydrodynamic equilibrium\, reduces the problem to one dimen
 sion. Using a 1D hydrodynamical code we explore the majority of parameter s
 pace and describe the different possible flows. In the 1D case\, we give an
 alytic approximations for the locations of the first shocks\, their strengt
 hs\, and the final density after the disk has again reached a steady state.
  This allows one to determine the temperature jump across the shock front a
 nd determine the observability\, modulo the yet unknown disk mass.\n</p>\n<

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Probing the Nature of Dark Matter through Small-sc
 ale Substructure</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Roughly 85% of the matter in the U
 niverse is in the form of dark matter (DM). Under gravitational interaction
 s\, DM clusters and forms hierarchical structure. Different DM models predi
 ct distinct features on small scales. For example\, the standard cold dark 
 matter (CDM) model predicts the formation of small halos down to earth mass
  scale\, which may not exist in other DM models such as the warm dark matte
 r. Thus to detect these small halos (<10^8 Msun) is the key to distinguish 
 different DM candidates. Observations based on gravitational interactions\,
  such as the strong gravitational lensing\, has helped to detect the smalle
 st DM halos so far even if they do not contain detectable stars. With more 
 upcoming observational data\, we expect to push the lowest detection limit 
 to even small scales. At the same time\, it becomes crucial to have a fast 
 but accurate way to predict the properties of these small (sub)halos for a 
 variety of DM models. In this talk\, I will show that using sim-analytic mo
 dels we are able to produce robust predictions for DM substructure\, such a
 s the mass function\, spatial distribution and internal density profiles. O
 ur models will help to better interpret the observation data and put a more
  robust constraint on DM models.\n\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Ioana Zelko</b></p>

 <p>Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs)\, in which a star is torn apart
  by a giant black hole at a galactic center may have very different appeara
 nces. The observational signature of the TDE is determined by the energy di
 ssipation of the debris. I will show that this depends\, in turn\, on the t
 rajectory of the debris which is largely determined by the pericenter dista
 nce of the orbit of the disrupted star. First\, I will explore the main thr
 ee types of TDEs which I call: Circularized\, Common and Partial. Then  I w
 ill discuss  Extreme TDEs\,  a new type of events that arise when the peric
 enter passage is very close to the black hole horizon. In Extreme TDEs gene
 ral relativistic effects that have not been seen before shape the debris’ o
 rbit leading to an observational signature that is very different from most
  TDEs. Finally\, I will  explore ``environmental” effects  and discuss the 
 fate of a TDE around an AGN in which an accretion disk rotates around the b
 lack hole. Here the interaction between the debris and the disk dominates t
 he energy dissipation process. The resulting signal is\, once more\, very d
 ifferent from the one of regular TDEs.</p>\n

 <p>Abstract: In this talk I will present multiple lines of evidence which a
 ll suggest that the LMC is a massive companion of our Galaxy\, with a mass 
 roughly one-sixth that of the Milky Way. This large of an LMC has many impl
 ications: our Galaxy can no longer be thought of as in isolation and many o
 f the structures in our Galaxy should be perturbed. First\, the LMC should 
 induce a substantial (~30-40 km/s) reflex motion in the Milky Way. I will p
 resent evidence of this reflex motion in both the Milky Way’s stellar halo 
 and its population of satellites. Along similar lines\, the LMC’s passage s
 hould induce a wake in the Milky Way’s stellar halo along its past orbit an
 d I will present evidence of this. Finally\, I will show how the LMC has af
 fected stellar streams in the Milky Way and how we can use these streams to
  measure the mass of the LMC. I will focus on the OC stream whose passage w
 ith the LMC roughly 300 Myr ago allows us to measure the past orbit of the 
 LMC and how much dynamical friction it has experienced during this time. I 
 will end with a discussion of how streams can be used to measure the deform
 ing dark matter haloes of the Milky Way and LMC and how we can use these to
  better understand the nature of dark matter.</p>\n

 n molecular gas should on average match the combination of self-gravity\, e

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>LYRA: Dwarf galaxies on small scales in a cosmolog
 ical context</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Dwarf galaxies (Mstar < 1e8 Msun) are 
 increasingly becoming an area of interest\, not only for Local Group studie
 s and for dark matter profiles but also as contributors to reionization and
  the chemical enrichment of the inter-galactic medium (IGM). With the prosp
 ect of deeper observations of local systems and increasing numbers of detec
 tions at higher redshift\, it is highly timely to advance our theoretical u
 nderstanding of the formation of dwarf galaxies\, including the relatively 
 small-scale processes of star formation (SF) and feedback that govern their
  evolution. Unfortunately\, the baryons that comprise the interstellar medi
 um (ISM) in cosmological simulations are typically modeled with effective (
 sub-grid) models that prevent the self-consistent formation of giant molecu
 lar clouds. I will present LYRA\, a novel galaxy formation model that reach
 es a critical scale where individual SNe can be resolved without depending 
 on a feedback efficiency parameter\, which has long been a major source of 
 uncertainty in such models. I will show that LYRA galaxies match the stella
 r mass\, size\, stellar kinematics and metallicity relations of Local Group
  dwarf galaxies well. Then I will present predictions concerning dwarf gala
 xy substructure and the high-z contamination of the IGM.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Reverberation mapping black hole accretion flows</
 b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Sitting at the heart of nearly all galaxies is a mas
 sive black hole\, that\, while typically 1000 times less massive than the g
 alaxy in which it resides\, has the potential to release enough energy via 
 accretion of gas onto the black hole\, to completely unbind the entire gala
 xy. Most of the power from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) is released clo
 se to the black hole\, and thus studying the inner accretion flow\, at the 
 intersection of gas inflow and energy outflow\, is essential for understand
 ing how black holes grow and affect galactic evolution. In the past decade\
 , we have had a breakthrough in how we probe the inner accretion flow\, thr
 ough the discovery of X-ray Reverberation Mapping\, where X-rays produced c
 lose to the black hole reverberate off inflowing gas. By measuring reverber
 ation time delays\, we can quantify the effects of strongly curved space ti
 me and the black hole spin\, which is key for understanding how efficiently
  energy can be tapped from the accretion process. In this talk\, I will giv
 e an overview of this field\, and show how extending these X-ray spectral-t
 iming techniques to transient accretion episodes is helping us probe the fo

 al interaction with the gaseous protoplanetary disk in which they are embed
 ded.\nThis interaction drives in particular a radial migration of the plane
 t\, so that its orbit may shrink or expand by several\norders of magnitude 
 over the disk lifetime. I will review the different types of migration stud
 ied thus far\, and I will put special\nemphasis on the dynamics of the coor

 ap)\, in a massive disk when the planet depletes\npartially its co-orbital 
 region (type III migration)\, or when the flow behaves adiabatically over a
  dynamical timescale:\nthe corotation torque is then found to depend on the
  disk’s radial entropy gradient. Lastly\, I will show that a low-mass\nprot
 oplanet subjected to planetesimal bombardment\, which heats its surrounding
  disk\, experiences an additional\, positive\ntorque component\, comparable
  in magnitude to the wake’s torque.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Yanqin Wu</b></p>

  (CIB) is the relic of UV/optical starlight reprocessed (absorbed and re-ra
 diated) by dust grains. With its intensity containing about half of the com
 bined starlight ever emitted\, it traces the star formation history of the 
 Universe over a wide range of redshift\, making its measurement crucial to 
 understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. A
 nother tracer of the evolution of galaxies and large-scale structure is dir
 ect starlight observed at optical wavelengths\, which accounts for roughly 
 the other half of the starlight. Measuring cross-correlations and cross-pow
 er spectra between optical and submm wavelengths thus has great potential t
 o comprehensively probe the build-up of stellar components over cosmic time
 . In this talk\, I will present the signal contained in the cross-correlati
 on between the CFIS and Herschel SPIRE submm images. Particular attention i
 s paid to systematics that may potentially bias the measurements\, includin
 g filtering and the impact of Galactic cirrus\, to ensure the robustness of
  the measurements. We also extract the signals in diffuse light from unreso
 lved sources separately from resolved sources. Our measurements are interpr
 eted with a halo model framework\, putting constraints on the star formatio
 n in galaxies and dark matter haloes across a wide range of masses and reds
 hifts. With upcoming survey missions and telescopes such as the Euclid and 
 CCAT\, our methodology and analysis presented in this talk will become cruc
 ial to our understanding of the cosmic star-formation history.</p>\n<p>Host

  reliably compute explosion outcomes and energies\, which depend sensitivel
 y on the complex radiation hydrodynamics of the post-shock region. The dyna
 mics of the (non-)explosion depend sensitively on how energy is transported
  from inside and near the proto-neutron star to material just behind the su
 pernova shock. While supernovae are observed daily across the electromagnet
 ic spectrum\, only second-hand information on what is driving these stellar
  explosions can be inferred through photons. Neutrinos and gravitational wa
 ves\, emitted from the very heart of the core-collapse supernova\, offer a 
 unique opportunity to directly probe the dynamics of the central engine dri
 ving the explosion. In this talk\, I will discuss how multi-messenger obser
 vations of core-collapse supernovae - combined with a broad comprehension o
 f the underlying physics of stellar collapse - can be used to directly prob
 e core-collapse supernova theory\, and infer the properties of nascent comp
 act objects therein borne.</p>\n

 ved increased attention in recent years. This is because it became clear th

 tions to the electroweak hierarchy problem\, and because modern astrophysic

  complexity is atomic dark matter\, where a fraction of dark matter is made
  up of dark protons and dark electrons interacting via a form of dark elect
 romagnetism with coupling constants and masses regarded as free parameters\
 , but this is a suitable stand-in for more complete scenarios that may addi

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Cosmic rays and MHD turbulence generation in inter
 stellar molecular clouds</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The diffusive propagation 
 of nonrelativistic cosmic ray (CR) protons undergoing energy losses by ioni
 zation in a dense homogeneous infinitely extended interstellar molecular cl
 oud (MC) is investigated in a spatially one-dimensional geometry. The stead
 y-state transport equation for the differential number density of nonrelati
 vistic CR protons is solved with the boundary condition that at the edge of
  cloud it agrees with the interstellar CR number density. The derived CR pr
 oton density distribution in the MC sensitively depends on two characterist
 ic length scales determined by the ratio of the time scales for diffusive p
 ropagation and ionization losses. In the edge region $0\\le Z\\le Z_0=1.47\
 \cdot 10^{-4}$ pc the ionization time scale is much longer than the diffusi
 on time scales for all CR momenta\, so here the CR proton density distribut
 ion equals the incoming interstellar CR proton distribution. For intermedia
 te penetration depths $Z_0<Z\\le Z_1=2.33$ pc only CR with low momenta are 
 affected by the ionization losses\, whereas at large penetration depths $Z>
 Z_1$ CRs at all momenta are affected by the ionization losses. This leads t
 o different momentum spectra and spatial distributions of the CR protons an
 d their total density in these three regions. \nConsequently\, nonrelativis
 tic CRs inside MCs lose energy by ionizing and heating the molecular gas at
  small penetration depths $Z<Z_1=2.33$ pc\, whereas at large penetration de
 pths $Z>Z_1$ they are collectively dissipated by the streaming instability.
  MCs with thicknesses much greater than $Z_1$ are an efficient sink of nonr
 elativistic CRs. \n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Thiem Hoang</b></p>

 p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Mergers of compact objects such as black holes and neutr
 on stars have recently risen as remarkable astrophysical laboratories to te
 st the laws of physics in extreme environments. From the gravitational wave
 s and electromagnetic signals produced by these events\, we can learn about
  the unknown properties of dense neutron rich matter\, study the laws of gr
 avity and the expansion of the Universe\, or attempt to constrain the origi
 n of the heavy nuclei observed on Earth today. Neutron star mergers are how
 ever complex non-linear systems that can only be truly understood through c
 ostly numerical simulations modeling general relativity\, relativistic magn
 etohydrodynamics\, neutrino transport\, and maybe even out-of-equilibrium n
 uclear reaction. In this talk\, I will provide a brief overview of the phys
 ics of these mergers and of our understanding of the matter outflows that t
 hey produce. I will then discuss the particular problem of general relativi
 stic neutrino transport\, and how modern simulations attempt to solve the h
 igh-dimensional equations of radiation transport at a reasonable computatio

 >Abstract: We make the first estimate of non-gravitational energy `profiles
 ' in galaxy cluster cores (and beyond) based on observational data. Compari
 ng the observed entropy profiles from the Representative XMM-Newton Cluster
  Structure Survey to simulated base entropy profiles without feedback from 
 both AMR and SPH non-radiative simulations\, we estimate the amount of addi
 tional\nnon-gravitational energy contained in the intra-cluster medium (ICM
 )\, as well as the total energy feedback\, from active galactic nuclei (AGN
 s\; the central AGNs in most cases) into the clusters.\nWe find that the en
 ergy feedback scales with the cluster temperature from groups to cluster sc
 ales with relatively small scatter. The estimated mean non-gravitational en
 ergy per particle remaining in the ICM after energy lost during cooling  is
  more than corresponding numbers used/found in radiative simulations of clu
 sters\, in general. By cross-correlating with the NVSS source catalog to de
 termine the radio luminosity\, L_R\, at 1.4 GHz of the central source(s) of
  our sample\, we find that the feedback correlates with L_R\, although with
  different normalization for cool-core and non-cool-core clusters. We argue
  that AGNs could provide a significant portion of the feedback. Simulations
  of clusters including AGN feedback must reproduce these feedback profiles 
 in addition to reproducing cluster scaling relations.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>IGM Enrichment with Adiabatic Feedback\, Metal Coo
 ling and Turbulent Diffusion</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: We present a study of 
 the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) using a series of s
 mooth particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations.\nWe employ models for metal 
 cooling and turbulent diffusion of metals\nand thermal energy. Star formati
 on and energetic feedback (with the\nadiabatic feedback model) naturally dr
 ive winds which reproduce both\nthe observed cosmic star formation history 
 (SFH) and the universal\nneutral hydrogen fraction. The mass and metal evol
 ution in stars and\nvarious gas phases was investigated. At z =0\, about 40
 % of the baryons\nare in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)\, but mos
 t metals (82%)\nare locked in stars. At higher redshift metals are mostly i
 n the IGM\ndue to more efficient loss from galaxies. Our results indicate t
 hat IGM\nmetals primarily reside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history\n(di
 ffering from the momentum driven wind model). The metallicity of the\nWHIM 
 lies between 0.01 and 0.1 solar with a slight decrease at lower\nredshifts.
  The metallicity evolution of the IGM and the gas inside\ngalaxies are broa
 dly consistent with\nobservations.\n\nWe characterized the wind efficiency 
 in our model. Galactic winds are\nmost efficient for galaxies in intermedia
 te mass range 10^10-10^11.5\nsolar masses. For galaxies with masses lower t
 han 10^10 solar masses\,\nthe background UV radiation prevents gas from acc
 retion\, resulting in\nlow metallicities for gas both within and outside th
 ese galaxies. The\nefficiency of star formation increases for galaxies abov
 e 10^10 solar\nmasses\, increasing the metal content of galactic winds. Bey
 ond 10^11.5\nsolar masses the star formation declines following the classic
  Rees and\nOstriker (1977) picture and the metal content of the objects and
  winds\nsaturates. Metal cooling transfers metals from the WHIM to bound ga
 s\,\nand increases the SFR. Metal diffusion allows winds to mix prior to\ne
 scape\, thus decreasing the IGM metal content in favour of gas within\ngala
 ctic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion significantly increases\nthe amo
 unt of low metallicity gas and changes the density-metallicity\nrelation.</

  Using simulated observations\, we infer constraints on our model parameter

 complementary to current high-redshift galaxy observations\, which can dete

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Dicke’s Superradiance -- From millisecond fast rad
 io bursts (FRBs) to multiyear maser bursts</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Burst ph
 enomena are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Understanding the origin of bright 
 and rapid bursts\, like FRBs\, is an important goal of contemporary astroph
 ysics.  We apply Dicke's superradiance\, a coherent quantum mechanical radi
 ation mechanism\, to explain these burst phenomena. We show that bursts las
 ting from a few milliseconds (FRBs) to a few years (e.g. OH masers) can be 
 produced by very large groups of entangled atoms/molecules. This is in cont
 rast with the common assumption that\, in the interstellar medium\, the ato
 ms/molecules in a radiating gas act independently from each other. Superrad
 iance\, a well-known and intensely studied phenomenon in the physics commun
 ity\, was first discussed by R. H. Dicke in 1954. I will present our superr
 adiance models developed to explain some maser flares and FRBs\, and discus
 s our results for the 6.7-GHz methanol\, 1612-MHz OH\, and 22-GHz water spe
 ctral lines. Our analyses suggest that the aforementioned groups of entangl
 ed atoms/molecules\, developing over distances of up to a few kilometers fo
 r maser flares and 1000 AU for FRBs\, can reproduce the observed light curv
 es.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Almog Yalinewich</b></p>

 stract: Extreme-mass-ratio binaries (EMRBs) and intermediate-mass-ratio bin
 aries (IMRBs) with a millisecond pulsar are gravitational-wave sources to b
 e observed by LISA\, with a guaranteed electromagnetic counterpart. These s
 ystems have complex orbital and spin dynamics\, which have observational si
 gnatures\, caused by spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling (through spin-curvat
 ure interaction). The narrow mass range of neutron stars greatly reduces th
 e search space in gravitational wave experiments and radio pulsar timing ob
 servations when establishing the system parameters and dynamical variables.
  This subgroup of EMRBs and IMEBs will help us to resolve important astroph
 ysical problems\, e.g. the validity of extending the M(BH)-sigma scaling fo
 r galactic spheroids to the very low-mass galaxies\, and whether or not low
 -mass dwarf galaxies and globular clusters harbour nuclear intermediate-mas
 s black hole. The extremely high precision that can be achieved in gravitat
 ional wave experiments and radio pulsar timing observations will provide an
  opportunity to directly detect gravitational clock effects arisen from spi
 n couplings. Radio monitoring of the orbital and spin evolution of the mill
 isecond pulsar in EMRBs can be used for deriving bootstrap methods for the 
 correction the drifts in the phases in the gravitational waves emitted from
  the EMRBs caused by the self-force\, a challenge needed to be resolved bef
 ore the launch of LISA.  </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Jennifer Chan</b></p>

 ract: The first direct detection of neutron-star--black-hole binaries will 
 likely be made with the gravitational wave observatories Advanced LIGO and 
 Advanced Virgo. Gravitational-wave searches rely on using waveform models t
 hat accurately represent the expected gravitational-wave signal. This signa
 l will depend on the masses of the black hole and the neutron star and also
  the angular momentum of both components. This angular momentum will affect
  the dynamics of the system and alter the phase evolution of the emitted gr
 avitational-wave signal. In this talk we demonstrate how neglecting the bla
 ck hole's angular momentum in the waveform models used in gravitational-wav
 e searches will affect the observation rate of neutron-star--black-hole coa
 lescences.  We investigate the improvement in observation rate that will be
  gained if waveform models with non-zero angular momentum aligned with the 
 orbital angular momentum are used. Systems that will not be detected with a
 ligned-spin waveforms are ones where precession of the orbital plane causes
  the gravitational-wave signal to match poorly with non-precessing filter w
 aveforms. We identify the regions of parameter space where such systems occ

 CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra. This approach relates the 
 CMB observables to the shape of the inflaton potential via a single source 
 function that is responsible for the observable features in the initial cur
 vature power spectrum. The source function is\, to an excellent approximati
 on\, simply related to the slope and curvature of the inflaton potential\, 
 even in the presence of large or rapidly changing deviations from scale-fre

 ectrum have led to interest in exploring models with features in the inflat
 ionary potential\, but such cases are typically studied on a case-by-case b
 asis. This formalism generalizes previous studies by exploring the complete
  parameter space of inflationary models in a single analysis. I will presen
 t results from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo likelihood analysis of WMAP 7-yea

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Neutrino Puzzle: Anomalies\, Interactions\, an
 d Cosmological Tensions</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: New physics in the neutrino
  sector might be necessary to address anomalies between different neutrino 
 oscillation experiments. Intriguingly\, it also offers a possible solution 
 to the discrepant cosmological measurements of $H_0$. We show here that del
 aying the onset of neutrino free-streaming until close to the epoch of matt
 er-radiation equality can naturally accommodate a larger value for the Hubb
 le constant\, while not degrading the fit to the cosmic microwave backgroun
 d (CMB) damping tail. We achieve this by introducing neutrino self-interact
 ions in the presence of a non-vanishing sum of neutrino masses. This "stron
 gly interacting" neutrino cosmology prefers a 3+1 neutrino scenario\, which
  has interesting implications for particle model-building and neutrino osci
 llation anomalies. Due to their impact on the evolution of the gravitationa
 l potential at early times\, self-interacting neutrinos and their subsequen
 t decoupling leave a tell-tale structure on the matter power spectrum. Our 
 analysis shows that it is possible to find radically different cosmological
  models that nonetheless provide excellent fits to the data\, hence providi
 ng an impetus to thoroughly explore alternate cosmological scenarios.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Exciting Waves in Accretion Disk Boundary Layers</
 b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In an accretion disk\, the boundary layer is the reg
 ion where the disk attaches to the star. Unlike in the disk proper\, the bo
 undary layer has a rotation profile which rises with radius\, since the rot
 ation profile must transition from that of the more slowly rotating star to
  that of the more quickly rotating disk. The rising rotation profile makes 
 the boundary layer (linearly) stable to the MRI instability. Therefore\, a 
 different mechanism must be responsible for transporting angular momentum i
 n the boundary layer and decelerating the disk material. The details of thi
 s mechanism are observationally significant since up to half of the total d
 isk luminosity comes from the boundary layer region.\nWorking with Roman Ra
 fikov and James Stone\, I have discovered a new instability which is capabl
 e of transporting angular momentum and driving accretion in the boundary la
 yer via waves rather than turbulence. This instability is related to the Pa
 paloizou-Pringle class of instabilities\, in that it is sourced by a corota
 tion resonance in the boundary layer. However\, it is distinct from the tra
 ditional Papaloizou-Pringle instability\; it is also robust\, feeding off t
 he large degree of shear in the boundary layer. I will present both analyti
 cal and numerical results\, which explain the mechanism of the new instabil
 ity (which we call the sonic or acoustic instability) and its role in angul
 ar momentum transport in accretion disk boundary layers. I will also descri
 be why no reasonable alpha prescription for the viscosity can be reconciled
  with this instability. This has significant ramifications for semi-analyti
 cal models of boundary layers\, which typically assume some form of alpha v
 iscosity.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Min-Kai Lin</b></p>

  the physical processes that govern the evolution of the interstellar mediu
 m. Stars form by gravitational collapse of dense and cold structures in mol
 ecular clouds but the process that leads to the formation of these overdens
 ities is still unclear. One key element seems to be related to the efficien
 cy of the formation of the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).\n\nSeveral studies ha
 ve aimed at understanding the production of the CNM through the condensatio
 n of the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) in a turbulent and thermally unstable fl
 ow using numerical simulations. In general\, these studies indicate the pre
 sence of a significant fraction of the mass being in the thermally unstable
  regime. However\, the thermodynamical conditions of the gas remain largely
  unexplored from the observational point of view. To go further\, and reall
 y compare with numerical simulation that are\, for now\, under constrained 
 by observation\, it is mandatory to map the column density structure of eac
 h phase and study the spatial variations of their centroid velocity and vel
 ocity dispersion. This calls for methods that can extract the information o
 f each HI phase from fully sampled 21 cm emission data only.\n\nI will pres
 ent ROHSA\, an original Gaussian decomposition algorithm based on a multire
 solution process from coarse to fine grid using a regularized non-linear le
 ast-square criterion to take into account simultaneously the spatial cohere
 nce of the emission and the multiphase nature of the gas. This method allow
 s us to infer a spatially coherent vision of the three-phase neutral ISM. B
 ased on these results\, I will discuss the new constraints that are obtaine
 d with a high-level of confidence on the thermal and turbulent properties o

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Interstellar Dust and the Quest for Our Cosmic Ori
 gins</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Whether obscuring signals from the epoch of in
 flation or seeding the growth of planets\, interstellar dust has an outsize
 d impact on both observational astronomy and the astrophysics of the Univer
 se. In this talk\, I will demonstrate how theoretical foundations I have la
 id in the physics and composition of dust have led to new insights into the
  structure and homogeneity of the interstellar medium\, with implications f
 or searches for primordial B-modes and cosmic birefringence. In light of im
 minent data from JWST\, I will highlight applications of physical dust mode
 ls to the formation of interstellar ices and organics and to the evolution 
 of dust and metals across cosmic time. Throughout I will emphasize the role
  of new microwave polarimetry from ACT\, the Simons Observatory\, CCAT-prim
 e\, LiteBIRD\, and CMB-S4\, and from proposed facilities like the BLAST Obs
 ervatory and the PRIMA Far-Infrared Probe\, in testing theoretical models a
 nd elucidating the interplay between dust\, gas\, and magnetic fields. Fina
 lly\, I will illustrate how physical modeling frameworks enable joint analy
 ses of these data with other interstellar observations (e.g.\, 3D extinctio
 n maps\, HI emission and phase decomposition\, radio recombination lines\, 
 and stellar abundances) to construct a 3D portrait of the magnetized inters
 tellar medium and to illuminate the lifecycle of dust from stellar outflows
  to protoplanetary disks.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>NA</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Baryon-Dark Matter Relative Velocity and a New
  Approach to the 3-Point Correlation Function"</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Due 
 to their different behaviors before decoupling (z~1020)\, at high redshift 
 (z~50) there is a relative velocity between baryons and dark matter that is
  coherent on very large scales. If this relative velocity couples to galaxi
 es today\, it can shift the BAO peak in the galaxy-galaxy 2-point correlati
 on function. Such a shift would systematically bias the expansion history i
 nferred using the BAO method. I will give a configuration space picture of 
 the relative velocity and show that the 3-point correlation function can be
  used to remove this systematic bias from the BAO method. I will then prese
 nt a reformulation of the 3PCF that:\n(i) permits computing the 3PCF in N^2
  not N^3 time\, N the number of objects\n(ii) allows analytic calculation o
 f a highly accurate covariance matrix\n(iii) gives perturbation theory pred
 ictions in excellent agreement with both mock catalogs and data\nUsing this
  approach on ~800\,000 galaxies in SDSS DR13 constrains linear and non-line
 ar bias and demonstrates a ~2.8 sigma BAO feature in the 3PCF. I'll conclud
 e with where we're going: modeling the 3PCF including RSD and using the BAO
  feature in it as a cosmological standard ruler just as the 2PCF already do
 es.\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Zhiqi Huang</b></p>

 The title of this talk remains an important question in theoretical astroph

 th of neutron stars and black holes\, are a major site for nucleosynthesis\

 what makes the difference between a fizzled result (black hole formation) a

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Unraveling galaxy evolution: connecting internal a
 nd external physical processes to their observational signatures</b></p>\n\
 n<p>Abstract: The formation and evolution of galaxies bridges the fundament
 al physics at large and small scales. As such\, a galaxy’s evolution\, shap
 ed by internal and external effects\, determines its properties and may lea
 ve observational signatures. Disentangling these signatures and the evoluti
 onary phases they correspond to requires understanding of the full ensemble
  of galaxy properties in both observations and simulations\, and detailed c
 omparisons. In this seminar I will introduce a number of ongoing projects t
 hat focus on connecting signature properties of certain groups of galaxies 
 to their formation history and environmental history. \n\nFor example\, I w
 ill show that galaxies that show counterrotating or misaligned components a
 re strongly influenced by their internal and environmental history and coul
 d potentially be used to gain information about the history of their large 
 scale environment and the cosmic web. \nAdditionally\, I will show that car
 eful comparisons between observational and theoretical data can significant
 ly improve our understanding of the importance of particular physical proce
 sses in theoretical models and simulations for galaxy evolution. In particu
 lar I will focus on the populations of star-forming and quiescent galaxies\
 , which are defined in a variety of ways in the literature. Through working
  toward comparisons using unified definitions and data-driven methods we ca
 n understand how different quenching processes affect observed quenching in
 dicators\, and use this to constrain theoretical models in the future.</p>\

 n\n<p>Abstract: The origin of the very energetic particles known as cosmic 
 rays (CRs) has puzzled scientists for more than a century\, since the pione
 ering discovery by Victor Hess in 1912. In the last decade\, a new generati
 on of X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes has been collecting evidence that CRs 
 are accelerated up to about $10^8$ GeV in the blast waves of supernova remn
 ants (SNRs). More recently\, modern supercomputers have opened a new window
  on the processes responsible for particle acceleration in astrophysical co
 llisionless plasmas\, allowing the study of CR acceleration via first-princ
 iples kinetic simulations.\nI present the most recent results of large hybr
 id (kinetic ions - fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic shocks\
 , in which ion acceleration efficiency and magnetic field amplification are
  investigated in detail as a function of shock inclination and strength. I 
 also discuss the theoretical and observational counterparts of these findin
 gs\, comparing them with predictions of diffusive shock acceleration theory
  and with observations of young SNRs. Finally\, I present the first full ki
 netic simulations that also show efficient acceleration of electrons\, whic
 h are crucial to understand the non-thermal emission from several astrophys
 ical objects\, such as SNRs\, active galaxies\, and galaxy clusters.</p>\n<

 own that molecular complexity is a natural outcome of interstellar chemistr

  to the formation of complex molecules are by no means fully understood and
  the remarkable depth of chemical complexity is still continuing to be reve
 aled. One feature of particular interest to us at present is the sulphur ch
 emistry in the dense interstellar medium\, which is not well understood.\n\
 nThe Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)\, a high-resolution ground-based
  telescope array in Chile\, was recently used by our astronomical colleague
 s for a spectral line survey of the famous Sagittarius B2(N) molecular clou
 d between 84 – 114.4 GHz. Our laboratory high resolution spectroscopic stud
 ies played a pivotal role in the detection and analysis of several species 
 in the complex spectra observed. For the first time\, a number of large Alk
 anols and Alkanethiol molecules were observed along with their associated i
 sotopologues. With the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)\
 , these have allowed deduction of the column densities and isotopic ratios 
 in the Sgr B2(N) environment for each molecule. Our team’s observations are
  supplemented by astrochemical modeling\, using a new network that\, for th
 e first time\, includes reaction pathways for alkanethiols.\n</p>\n<p>Host:

 ses in the early Universe could have resulted in net helicity in the primor

 arization over the other. In principle\, parity violating EB and TB correla
 tions in the cosmic microwave background offer a probe of helicity\, howeve
 r these turn out to be undetectable except in the most optimistic scenarios
 . I will describe a tidal effect whereby primordial gravity waves leave an 
 imprint in the statistics of the large-scale structure\, which could be use
 d to study helicity. In contrast to the CMB\, these tidal imprints allow gr
 avity-waves to be reconstructed without loss of geometric information\, whi

 ed questions in star and galaxy formation revolve around star formation and
  "feedback" from both massive stars and accretion onto super-massive black 
 holes. This occurs in a chaotic\, highly nonlinear system dominated by supe
 r-sonic turbulence and gravity. Yet\, despite this complexity\, there is re
 markable regularity observed in many properties. I'll present new models wh
 ich attempt to realistically model the diverse physics of the interstellar 
 medium\, star formation\, and feedback from stellar radiation pressure\, su
 pernovae\, and photo-ionization\, and their interplay with feedback from lu
 minous quasars. These mechanisms lead to 'self-regulated' galaxy and star f
 ormation\, in which global correlations such as the Schmidt-Kennicutt law\,
  the black hole-host galaxy correlations\, and the global inefficiency of s
 tar formation emerge naturally. I'll discuss how\, within galaxies\, feedba
 ck regulates the structure of the interstellar medium\, and how many observ
 ed properties of the ISM\, star formation\, and galaxies can be understood 
 as a fundamental consequence of super-sonic turbulence in a rapidly cooling
 \, self-gravitating medium. But feedback also produces galactic super-winds
  that can dramatically alter the cosmological evolution of galaxies\, their
  behavior in galaxy mergers\, and structure of the inter-galactic medium. I
 'll highlight how a combination of improved theoretical models and observat
 ions can elucidate the physics driving these winds and their role in phenom
 ena on an enormous range of spatial scales.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marcelo Alvare

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The anisotropies of the Cosmic Infrared Background
 : a new tool to probe the evolution of structures </b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: 
 The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is the contribution of infrared (IR) g
 alaxies integrated on the whole history of the Universe. Its energy is of t
 he order of that emitted in the optical whereas in the local Universe the e
 nergy emitted in the IR is around one third of that emitted in the optical.
  It implies that the Universe went through an IR era billions of years ago.
  Indeed\, the star formation rate was dominated by IR galaxies at 0.5<z<3.\
 n\nIn the far-IR data are limited by confusion which makes impossible the s
 tudy of the clustering of IR galaxies using the correlation function. At sm
 all spatial scales the clustering constrains the physics inside one halo of
  dark matter and at large scales it probes the linear bias of IR galaxies a
 nd thus the underlying dark matter distribution. A way of circumventing con
 fusion is the study of the anisotropies of the CIB as they contain the clus
 tering. However\, the power spectrum of the CIB anisotropies are contaminat
 ed by the cirrus emission at large spatial scales.\n\nI will show that usin
 g HI data we can derive a cirrus free power spectrum of the CIB anisotropie
 s  and thus measure the clustering of starburst galaxies at large spatial s
 cales. In order to analyse these new measurements and existing ones in a co
 nsistent way\, I will present a clustering model of IR galaxies based on a 
 dark matter distribution model linked to a model of the evolution of IR gal
 axies. The whole is parametric which enables me to carry a qualitative stud
 y of the degeneracies of the free parameters as well as investigating which
  kind of halo contribute to the power spectrum or the evolution of the line
 ar bias of these galaxies.\n</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Stellar Dynamics in the Galactic Center</b></p>\n\
 n<p>Abstract: he distribution of stars near the supermassive black hole at 
 the Galactic center is\nobserved to be very different than predicted by the
 oretical models: instead of a Bahcall-Wolf\ncusp\, there is a parsec-scale 
 core.  This talk focusses on possible models for the formation\nand persist
 ence of such a low-density core\, and its implications for the distribution
 \nof massive remnants. A core results naturally from a model in which the n
 uclear star\ncluster is formed via repeated inspiral of globular clusters i
 nto the Galactic center.  I will present\nresults from a set of N-body simu
 lations of this process\, which show that other properties\nof the NSC\, in
 cluding its mass and outer density profile\, are also naturally reproduced.
 \nChandrasekhar's dynamical friction formula predicts that the frictional f
 orce effectively vanishes\nfor a massive body inspiraling into a flat core 
 around a SMBH. This prediction has been tested\nusing large-scale N-body si
 mulations\; one finds that the rate of orbital decay never drops precisely\
 nto zero\, because stars moving faster than the test body contribute to the
  frictional force inside the core.\nWhen this contribution is included in t
 he expression for the dynamical friction and  the changes induced\nby the m
 assive body on the stellar distribution are taken into account\, Chandrasek
 har's theory reproduces\nthe rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However
 \, this rate is still substantially smaller than the rate\npredicted by a n
 aive application of Chandrasekhar's formula. To investigate the implication
 s of this slower\ndecay rate for the Galactic center\, we  evolved a popula
 tion of stellar black holes in models with a stellar\ncore. After ~10 Gyr t
 he density of stellar black holes can  remain substantially less than that 
 in stars\,\ncontrary to models that assume a density cusp in the stars. One
  consequence is that rates of capture of\nstellar BHs by the SMBH at the Ga
 lactic center (EMRIs) may be much lower than in standard models.\n</p>\n<p>

 istortions</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In the galaxy clustering surveys redshif
 t corresponds to the true distance according to the Hubble Law. In addition
 \, peculiar velocities induced by the local gravitational potential are not
  associated with the Hubble flow and can cause distortions in redshift spac
 e. We study these distortions in phase space distribution function approach
  in order to model the power spectra of dark matter and halos. In this appr
 oach RSD of dark matter halos can be written as a sum over density weighted
  velocity moments correlators\, with the lowest order being density\, momen
 tum density and stress energy density. Modelling of these contributing term
 s is done by combining perturbative methods and non-local biasing model to 
 connect halos to the underlying dark matter distribution. In modelling the 
 isotropic part of the RSD power spectrum we go beyond the Poissonian estima
 tes of shot noise and allow for the scale dependence seen in the N-body sim
 ulation data. We present the results of RSD model for multipoles as well as
  dependence of the power spectrum on the amplitude and direction of the Fou
 rier modes. Transforming these we also obtain the results in configuration 
 space. In addition to the power spectra we also show the models for the vel

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Tracing the chemical origins of exoplanetary world
 s</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The compositions of planets are set by the compos
 itions of gas\, ice\, and dust inside protoplanetary disks. The abundances 
 of carbon\, oxygen\, and nitrogen (C\, N\, O) elemental carriers are partic
 ularly important for the habitability of planets. Constraining how these el
 emental abundances evolve with time and location in natal disks is key to p
 redict compositions of planetesimals and planets. In this talk\, I will dis
 cuss current observations and constraints on the abundances of the main C\,
  N\, O carriers in protoplanetary disks. I will discuss the puzzle of large
  CO gas depletion seen in recent surveys of protoplanetary disks. Compariso
 ns between observations and chemical models indicate that the CO gas abunda
 nce strongly depends on the disk evolutionary stage and radius. Interesting
 ly\, these CO abundance structures are consistent with numerical simulation
 s of growth and transport of icy dust grains in disks. These results sugges
 t that the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks maybe highly coupled 
 with physical processes during planet formation.</p>\n

 hat has been ignored in the literature. While the contribution from the con
 nected term on small scales (k>0.1 h/Mpc) is subdominant relative to the un
 connected term\, we find that its contribution to the kSZ power spectrum at
  l = 3000 at z<6 can be as large as ten percent of the unconnected term\, w
 hich would reduce the allowed contribution from the reionization epoch (z>6
 ) by twenty percent.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marcelo Alvarez</b></p>

 on</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract:  I will discuss axions as dark matter candidates
 \; in particular light axions with large decay constants as motivated by st
 ring theory. If the recent BICEP measurement of B-modes in the CMB is taken
  to indicate tensor perturbations from inflation\, the large energy scales 
 necessary induce large axion isocurvature perturbations. In order that thes
 e perturbations are not in conflict with Planck adiabaticity constraints\, 
 the axions must be sub-dominant in dark matter. I will present these constr
 aints and demonstrate how they are complimentary over a wide range of param
 eter space\, spanning ~15 orders of magnitude in axion mass\, with other co
 nstraints\, in particular those from large scale structure and the CMB temp
 erature. In large scale structure\, light axions provide an elegant solutio
 n to the "small-scale crises" of CDM. I will review this solution\, and how
  it is distinct from\, and preferable to\, a WDM solution. If axions do pla
 y a role in structure formation (or indeed in laboratory processes)\, we ha
 ve an opportunity to search for them in a manner independent from the infla
 tionary interpretation of BICEP\, and thus evidence for or against their ex

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Towards an age for every star: calibrating the age
 -rotation relations</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In order to explore the evoluti
 on of planetary systems\, we first need to develop a method for measuring s
 tellar ages from photometry alone. The age-rotation\, or 'gyrochronology' r
 elations have the potential to be an extremely powerful stellar dating meth
 od\, since only measurements of rotation period and mass (or mass proxy) ar
 e required to infer a star's age. However\, data from the Kepler spacecraft
  reveal a tension between asteroseismic and gyrochronological ages. I will 
 discuss the potential sources of this discrepancy and ways in which we can 
 advance our understanding of magnetic braking. New data from the Kepler and
  TESS spacecraft will allow us to resolve this tension and quantify the lev
 el of intrinsic scatter in the gyrochronology relations. I will demonstrate
  two new methods for measuring precise\, accurate and probabilistic rotatio
 n periods for stars observed by Kepler and TESS. Once gyrochronology is ful
 ly understood\, we will be able to infer an age for every star observed by 
 Kepler\, K2 and TESS and will\, for the first time\, be able to explore the
  impact of stellar age on planetary occurrence rates.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Dani

 >Abstract: The existence of a supermassive black hole in nearly every galac
 tic nucleus is no longer in doubt\, but the question of how these black hol
 es formed is wide open. I will argue that they could have formed directly v
 ia the accumulation and collapse of supermassive (> 106 M_Sun) stars\, if t
 he infall rate of gas into the nucleus was high enough. Black hole formatio
 n by very rapid infall could have occurred in pregalactic haloes as early a
 s redshifts ~10-20\, at lower redshifts in the nuclei of protogalaxies\, or
  even as late as the quasar era in fairly mature galaxies. Global gravitati
 onal instabilities get rid of excess angular momentum and the infalling gas
  forms a self-gravitating\, optically thick structure. As matter piles on\,
  the core burns through its nuclear fuel and eventually collapses to form a
  black hole with a mass of roughly 104-105 solar masses. The black hole can
  then grow further by accreting from its envelope at an extremely super-Edd
 ington rate\, possibly increasing in mass by another order of magnitude bef
 ore expelling the envelope. "Quasistars" - shrouded black holes accreting f
 rom massive envelopes - should resemble ultraluminous red giants and might 
 be detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. </p>\n

 continuities across an interface\, while the pressure remains continuous\, 
 ranging from cold fronts in galaxy clusters to emerging magnetic flux in th
 e solar corona. These contact discontinuities can be unstable to the Raylei
 gh-Taylor instability if the density gradient is opposite the direction of 
 gravity. In some contexts\, the plasma near a contact discontinuity is hot 
 and dilute\, which causes heat conduction to be anisotropic along magnetic 
 field lines. In this talk\, I will discuss how anisotropic heat conduction 
 alters the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\, both in the linear and nonlinear r
 egimes. Numerical simulations suggest that the nonlinear evolution can be d
 escribed as the superposition of three physical processes: vertical tempera

 mably be bright in gamma-rays\, but these would not be resolved as point so
 urces. Instead\, they contribute gamma-rays as unresolved sources to the ex

 llected over more than a decade of operation\, the exact contribution of SF
 Gs to the EGB and the signatures their emission would imprint on the gamma-

 trate that such emission can be characterised by just a small number of key

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Assessing the interior mixing of B-type stars from
  gravity-mode asteroseismology </b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The chemical evolut
 ion of the Universe is largely guided by the life of massive stars. These s
 tars are born with a convective core on the main-sequence\, and are heavily
  influenced by additional mixing occurring at both the convective core boun
 dary and in the radiative envelope. Such mixing transports additional hydro
 gen fuel from the envelope to the convective core\, allowing the stars to l
 ive longer and to enhance their final helium core mass at the end of the ma
 in-sequence evolution. As a consequence\, chemical mixing has a high impact
  on the stellar evolution of both intermediate- and high-mass stars\, and i
 s one of the dominant uncertainties in their stellar structure and evolutio
 n theory. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for probing stellar interiors
  through the detection and interpretation of stellar oscillations. With thi
 s seminar I will demonstrate how we can use these oscillations to probe the
  internal mixing and rotation of stars\, as well as discuss recent results 
 from the Kepler space telescope and the promises of TESS.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Modeling the small-scale Lyman-alpha forest and it
 s cross-power spectrum with dark matter halos</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Three
 -dimensional correlations of the Lyman-alpha forest and cross correlations 
 between the Lyman-alpha forest and quasars have been measured on large scal
 es\, allowing a precise measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO
 ) feature at redshifts z>2. These 3D correlations are often modelled using 
 linear perturbation theory\, but full-shape analyses to extract cosmologica
 l information beyond BAO will require more realistic models capable of desc
 ribing non-linearities present at smaller scales. In this talk\, I present 
 recent work looking at the Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum and the Lyman-al
 pha-halo cross-power spectrum measured in the Sherwood simulations. I compa
 re these measurements to different models describing the small-scale deviat
 ions from linear theory. Our work confirms that the model presented in Arin
 yo-i-Prats et al. (2015) fits the measured Lyman-alpha 3D power up to k=10 
 h/Mpc with an accuracy better than 5% and shows that the same model can als
 o describe the 1D correlations with similar precision. A new model we devel
 op appears capable of describing the Lyman-alpha-halo cross-power spectrum 
 within a few percent up to k=1 h/Mpc.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Martine Lokken</b></

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Filamentary Environment and Mass Measurements of G
 alaxy Clusters</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Galaxy clusters reside at the nodes 
 of cosmic web and are fed matter along the filaments. This filamentary envi
 ronment is important to understand the formation and the evolution of galax
 y clusters\, and is also inevitably included when we observe them. This lat
 ter effect generates projection effects on cluster observables. Reducing er
 rors in measuring cluster masses is of interest since a cluster's mass is a
  crucial property for many areas of astrophysics and cosmology. We study th
 e filamentary environment surrounding galaxy clusters and its effect on the
  cluster mass measurements by constructing a filament catalogue in a high-r
 esolution N-body simulation. We consider the statistical properties of fila
 ments around galaxy clusters. Not only filaments but also the majority of m
 ass in halos and number of galaxies in the local environment of clusters te
 nds to lie on planes which are mostly aligned with each other and with the 
 cluster's major axis. We show that this local planar environment can be one
  source of projection effects that bias cluster mass measurements. Sources 
 of mass measurement scatters are shared between different mass measurement 
 methods\, generating correlations in their respective scatters. This correl
 ated scatter mitigates the complementary information of cluster mass measur
 ements in multi-wavelength observations. We study the scatter by calculatin
 g correlations/covariances between them and performing Principal Component 
 Analysis (PCA). As expected\, the scatter from different techniques tends t
 o be correlated. We find that the combination of scatters which dominates t
 he variance of all the measurements is common for the majority of clusters.
  Its dominance tends to be enhanced when observing along the cluster's majo
 r axis. We also find shared trends among cluster mass scatter\, intrinsic a
 nd environmental properties of clusters using PCA.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Linda S

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Fast Radio Bursts and Cosmic Dark Matter</b></p>\n
 \n<p>Abstract: Some fast radio bursts appear to involve an extraordinary re
 lease of energy\,\n   $10^{39}$-$10^{40}$ erg in the 1-10 GHz band\, within
  a brief interval of milliseconds\n   or less.   Nothing close to this has 
 been clearly detected from a neutron star\,\n   and existing models of cohe
 rent radio emission from radio pulsars or relativistic  \n   shocks fail by
  orders of magnitude to match such intensities.  I will describe\n   an alt
 ernative approach to fast radio bursts which connects them with a new form 
 of\n   cosmic dark matter.  The emission rate of FRBs is connected to the i
 nternal properties of\n   macroscopic magnetic dipoles through their collis
 ion rate\, implying a mm-cm size\n   and formation at a grand unified energ
 y scale.  A small-scale release of energy \n   (inside a radio wavelength) 
 leads robustly to radio emission through at least \n   three electrodynamic
  channels\, none of which depends on ad hoc assumptions \n   about particle
  clumping.  This emission is predicted to peak above 10-100 GHz\, and \n   
 naturally accomadates rapid repetitions on millisecond timescales.  FRB sou
 rces \n   which repeat over longer timescales are associated with supermass
 ive black holes \n   that grow adiabatically in galactic nuclei and accrete
  a small amount of this mildly \n   dissipative dark matter\;  these source
 s are predicted to show extreme Faraday \n   rotation and burst more freque
 ntly at higher frequencies.  A point flash near a \n   rotating black hole 
 is strongly lensed\, showing interesting ringing effects and \n   longer de
 lays by reflection off cool hydrogen clouds.  One-time FRB emission is\,\n 
   by contrast\, more widely spread within galaxies.  EM pulses strong enoug
 h to produce\n   FRBs also accelerate ions up to energies $10^{19}$-$10^{20
 }$ eV\;  and nearby white dwarf \n   stars experience collisions with the h
 ypothesized dark matter particles at an interesting \n   rate.</p>\n

 Abstract: Our understanding of the final stages of black hole mergers has i

 discoveries is the one that merging pair of spinning black holes can genera

 il thousands of km/s. The detection these gravitational waves is now just f
 ew years into the future. It will be major breakthrough in fundamental phys

  planetary candidates with radii between 1 and 4 times that of Earth. These
  planets have no analogues in our Solar System\, providing a potentially re
 volutionary opportunity to assess planet formation and evolution processes 
 for a new planetary population.  By coupling theoretical work with sophisti
 cated statistical modeling\, we place quantitative constraints on the distr
 ibution of physically relevant properties\, such as planet compositions\, w
 hile accurately incorporating the large uncertainties and biases in the Kep
 ler data.  We first apply this framework to the composition distribution of
  Kepler's sub-Neptunes: assuming an internal structure consisting of a rock
 y core with a hydrogen and helium envelope\, we find that these envelopes a
 re most likely to be ~ 1\\% of these planets' total mass with an intrinsic 
 scatter of ± 0.5 dex.  Our results do not produce a one-to-one relationship
  between super-Earth masses and radii.  Accordingly\, we derive a probabili
 ty density function that incorporates the intrinsic scatter in planetary ma
 sses at a given radius\, which provides dynamical studies a more appropriat
 e means to map Kepler radii to masses.  Finally\, we present first results 
 from our campaign to detect stellar companions to Kepler super-Earth host s
 tars using the laser guide star adaptive optics systems at Lick Observatory
 \, and discuss implications for the orbital evolution of this entirely new 
 class of planets.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Linda Strubbe</b></p>

 round a wide range of stellar types\, with corresponding differences in the

 . Future missions such as the proposed LIFE (the Large Interferometer for E

  the utility of combining intensity maps with conventional surveys\, both f

 attering</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Obtaining information about exoplanets' ch
 emical composition and the physical conditions in their atmospheres is cruc
 ial for improving our understanding of the physical processes that drive pl
 anetary formation and evolution. In order to provide more robust and reliab
 le constraints on the properties of exoplanets\, we need to keep searching 
 for new diagnostics of exoplanet atmospheres\, complementary to the current
 ly existing methods. In my talk\, I will present how spectral signatures of
  Raman scattering at short optical wavelengths can be used to probe the atm
 ospheres of exoplanets. Raman scattering on molecules in a planetary atmosp
 here imprints specific features in the geometric albedo spectrum of the pla
 net that can be used to constrain the properties of the atmosphere. The int
 ensity of Raman features is related to the depth of the atmosphere\, and ca
 n therefore be used to distinguish a clear\, deep atmosphere from an atmosp
 here with high-altitude clouds. Raman features can also be used to spectros
 copically identify the main scatterer in the atmosphere\, even molecules li
 ke hydrogen or nitrogen\, which otherwise do not show prominent spectral si
 gnatures. The relative intensity of different Raman features depends on the
  initial population of different molecular levels\, and can therefore be us
 ed to infer the temperature of the atmosphere. I will discuss the prospects
  for detecting spectral features of Raman scattering in nearby exoplanets u
 sing the next-generation observational facilities. At the end of the talk\,
  I will briefly discuss two other projects --  an ongoing work on escaping 
 exoplanet atmospheres and my recent paper on the FIRE simulations of clumpy
  galaxies at high redshift.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>TBD</b></p>

 stract: Galaxy evolution is primarily driven by the life cycle of gas. The 
 circumgalactic medium is a key part in this cycle\, viz. the CGM is a major
  gas reservoir where inflowing cold gas mixes with outflowing metal enhance
 d gas and ultimately settles onto the ISM. Galaxy-galaxy mergers have been 
 hypothesized to play a critical role in shaping the CGM’s chemical and phys
 ical structure. In addition to being a fundamental evolutionary path for ga
 laxies to grow their stellar mass and trigger star formation and AGN activi
 ty\, galaxy mergers are known to vigorously reshuffle the gas reservoir due
  to the strong tidal torques and feedback processes which are induced by th
 e interaction. However\, detailed predictions for the effect of galaxy merg
 ers on the CGM are currently lacking. In this talk\, I will present a new a
 nalysis of the CGM of major mergers using cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic
 al simulations. This analysis provides the first constraints on the interpl
 ay between mergers and the CGM in a self-consistent cosmological framework.
  I will demonstrate the long lasting effects of mergers on the metal conten
 t of the CGM and its ionization\, specifically highlighting the importance 
 of mergers in moulding the CGM of galaxies: increasing its metal content by
  factors of 2-3\, preferentially increasing the covering fractions of the h
 igh ionization species\, and the large radial extent of such enhancements. 
 Finally\, I will use these simulations to make predictions of absorption li
 ne column densities and associated impact parameters in the CGM of post-mer
 ger galaxies\, that can be directly tested with observations (i.e. with HST
 -COS).</p>\n

  To understand these objects as well as related problems in galaxy formatio

 ike the spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (relating the local g
 as reservoir to the rate of star formation) and connections between gas tur
 bulence (velocity dispersions/line widths) and star formation rates. I will
  show how highly efficient local star formation translates to low global st

 r formation episodes\, to the importance of clustered supernovae in blowing
  superbubbles in the ISM of galaxies and as drivers of galactic superwinds.
  These models give us insight as to where and why stellar feedback injects 
 momentum into the ISM versus the near-CGM\, and has strong implications for
  the formation of galactic disks near z ~ 1.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Rimpei Chiba<

 h as HST/JWST\, among others. However\, since these measurements are hinder

 n). But how to balance this tradeoff efficiently? \nThis problem is akin to
  the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in probability theory\, wherein a gam
 bler faces a series of slot machines with unknown winning odds and must dev
 elop a strategy to maximize his/her winnings with some finite number of pul

 achine-learning algorithms have been developed in an effort to maximize the
  winnings. \nBy constructing adaptive survey strategies based on heuristic 
 methods to solve the MAB problem\, we will demonstrate that ground-based B-

 -scalar ratio. Implementations of MAB strategies elsewhere are focus of cur

 12CO\, 13CO\, C18O\, and CN at arcminute- (ie\, parsec-scale) resolution\,

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>New directions in galaxy formation and cosmology f
 ollowing the EDGES 78 MHz detection</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: On March 1st of
  last year\, the EDGES collaboration reported the detection of a sharp abso
 rption signal in the all-sky radio spectrum at 78 MHz. This frequency is ro
 ughly consistent with early theoretical predictions for the global 21-cm si
 gnal\, a sky-averaged spectral signature of neutral hydrogen atoms in the i
 ntergalactic medium before cosmic reionization. However\, the reported ampl
 itude is roughly 2.5 times larger than the strongest possible global 21-cm 
 signal in standard cosmological models. This startling feature of the EDGES
  signal has led to a variety of exotic explanations\, including milli-charg
 ed dark matter and as-yet-unidentified radio backgrounds in the early Unive
 rse\, both of which can amplify 21-cm absorption signals relative to standa
 rd expectations. In this talk\, I will first highlight the flurry of ideas 
 that have arisen in the last year to explain the anomalous amplitude of the
  EDGES signal. Then\, I will turn to an under-appreciated aspect of the sig
 nal: its timing is not consistent with empirically-calibrated models of hig
 h-z galaxies. If confirmed\, the EDGES signal may thus be evidence of new p
 hysics *and* new astrophysics.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Laura Keating</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Modeling high redshift structure formation and rei
 onization</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: One of the exciting new frontiers in cosm
 ology and structure formation is the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)\, a period
  when the radiation from the early stars and galaxies ionized almost all ga
 s in the Universe. This epoch forms an important evolutionary link between 
 the smooth matter distribution at early times and the highly complex struct
 ures seen today. Gaining insights into this epoch has been quite challengin
 g because the current generation of telescopes are only able to probe the t
 ail end of this process. Fortunately\, a whole slew of instruments that hav
 e been specifically designed to study the high-redshift Universe (JWST\, AL
 MA\, Roman Space Telescope\, HERA\, SKA\, CCAT-p\, SPHEREx)\, are about to 
 come online. This will unleash a flood of observational data that will ushe
 r the study of EoR into a new\, high-precision era. It is\, therefore\, imp
 erative that theoretical/numerical models achieve sufficient accuracy and p
 hysical fidelity to meaningfully interpret this new data. In this talk\, I 
 will introduce the THESAN simulation framework that is designed to efficien
 tly leverage current and upcoming high redshift observations to constrain t
 he physics of reionization. The multi-scale nature of the process is tackle
 d by coupling large volume (~100s Mpc) simulations designed to study the la
 rge-scale statistical properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) that is 
 undergoing reionization\, with high-resolution (~ 10 pc) simulations that z
 oom-in on single galaxies which are ideal for predicting the resolved prope
 rties of the sources responsible for it. I will briefly discuss application
 s from the first set of papers\, including predictions for high redshift ga
 laxy properties\, the galaxy-IGM connection\, Ly-α transmission and back re
 action of reionization on galaxy formation. I will then highlight the poten
 tial for using line intensity mapping of spectral lines originating from th
 e interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and the 21 cm emission from the neu
 tral hydrogen gas in the Universe to constrain galaxy formation and cosmolo
 gy. I will finish by highlighting how this numerical framework\, coupled wi
 th accurate observational predictions promises important and potentially tr
 ansformative changes in our understanding of the primitive Universe.</p>\n<

  radiation\ncomes from the decay of the orbits of binary pulsar systems\, b
 ut the direct\ndetection of a gravitational wave has never been achieved. S
 everal\ninternational efforts are underway to achieve this including those 
 of the\nLIGO and Virgo collaborations.\n\nThe first-generation LIGO and Vir
 go laser interferometer gravitational-wave\nantennas are scheduled to be re
 placed with second-generation instruments in\nthe next five years. These ad
 vanced instruments are designed to have\nsubstantially improved sensitivity
 . This will bring with it new challenges\nwhen searching the data from thes
 e antennas for evidence of gravitational\nwaves from collisions of neutron 
 stars and of black holes. Even with five\nyears of projected computer capac
 ity and performance increases the current\nanalysis technique will be impra
 ctical in the advanced detector era.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss new ana
 lysis techniques\, currently under\ndevelopment by myself and collaborators
 . These techniques exploit the\ngeometric properties of the space of wavefo
 rms generated by colliding\nneutron stars and black holes to reduce the com
 putational cost of the\nsearch for such waveforms. The techniques allow us 
 to construct novel\ndetection and noise rejection statistics\, and make ext
 ensive use of\ngstreamer\, a Free multimedia signal processing framework. W
 e believe this\nwork will be an essential part of the first direct detectio
 n of\ngravitational waves. \n

 e-ionized hydrogen throughout the Universe. Since the galaxies at\nredshift

 y were strongly clustered on scales of up to ~100\ncomoving Mpc. Therefore\
 , a proper numerical simulation of the reionization\nepoch requires a large
  dynamic range of scales\, with a sufficiently large\nbox size to be repres
 entative and a sufficiently fine resolution to\ncapture the collapse of low
 -mass galaxies. Theoretical calculations\npredict that most of the star for
 mation at z>10 occurred in galaxies that\nare more than an order of magnitu
 de fainter than the deepest HST WFC3/IR\nsurvey.  Observationally\, the dis
 tribution of matter will be mapped over the coming decade through surveys o

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Orbital dynamics of barred galaxies</b></p>\n\n<p>
 Abstract: Galactic bars are ubiquitously seen in disk galaxies\, including 
 our own Milky Way. Bars are one of the largest non-axisymmetric structures 
 of galaxies and can substantially affect the motion of stars throughout the
  disk. Understanding their impact is therefore crucial\, in particular in t
 he context of the Milky Way\, where both space and ground-based telescopes 
 are providing stellar measurements with unprecedented precision and quantit
 y. In this seminar\, I will discuss the basic morphology of stellar orbits 
 in barred galaxies and how they evolve under the bar's slow evolution. I wi
 ll begin with a simple linear perturbation theory and show how this rudimen
 tary approach can in fact qualitatively explain many of the features observ
 ed in barred galaxies. In the latter part\, I will discuss the response of 
 stellar orbits against the secular spin-down of the bar. Using the notion o
 f adiabatic invariance\, I will explain how resonantly trapped stars can mi
 grate a significant distance by surfing on resonances and how this phenomen
 on may play a key role in understanding the local stellar kinematics and ch
 emistry.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Rimpei Chiba</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Physics and Cosmology of TeV Blazars</b></p>\n
 \n<p>Abstract: The universe is teeming with very high energy gamma ray sour
 ces (> 100 GeV)\, but it is generally thought that their impact on the univ
 erse is minor at best.  On energetic grounds\, this assumption seems well-f
 ounded because the energy density in TeV photons is 0.2% of that of ionizin
 g photons from quasars.  However\, as I hope to show in this talk\, this is
  not the case. Rather\, the greater efficiency by which TeV photons can be 
 converted to heating in the intergalactic medium (IGM) allows TeV blazars d
 ominate the heating of the IGM at low redshift.  I will discuss the nature 
 of this conversion via beam instabilities.  I will then discuss how the res
 ultant heating from these TeV sources makes dramatic differences in the for
 mation of structure in the universe.  In particular\, I will discuss how it
  gives rise to the inverted temperature-density profile of the IGM\, the bi
 modality of galaxy clusters\, and the paucity of dwarf galaxies in galactic
  halos and voids.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Geoff Vasil</b></p>

 s that is 1\,000 times larger than the state of the art\, uncovering the se
 lf-regulation mechanisms of galactic ecosystems. It will pioneer systematic
 \, spectroscopic monitoring across the whole sky\, revealing changes on tim
 escales from 20 minutes to 20 years.  The project is now developing new har

 some of the exotic millisecond pulsars observed in clusters. I will also br
 iefly discuss an ongoing work where I explore how neutron star tidal disrup

  the formation of isolated millisecond pulsars in GCs. The products of some

 . Our close neighbour Venus provides a good example of how complex solving 
 the inverse problem can be\, even after detailed observation by a successio

 t the heart of nearly every massive galaxy\, highlighting a deep connection
  between these cosmic behemoths and their host galaxies. The discovery of S
 MBHs so early in the universe's history challenges conventional models of b
 lack hole formation and growth. In this talk\, I will outline how self-inte
 racting dark matter (SIDM) offers a compelling solution to this cosmic myst
 ery through the process of gravothermal evolution. \n\nWhile SMBH seed form
 ation from the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos has been explored\, esti
 mates for the resulting seed masses have been difficult to accurately captu
 re as the late evolution of the evolution of SIDM halos was not well unders
 tood. My recent work has made significant progress in this area\, providing
  more precise predictions for the core properties in the late evolution of 
 SIDM halos. With the discovery of a new approximate universality in stages 
 later in the evolution than previously studied\, I have developed a semi-an
 alytic approach to estimate the core properties at the latest stages of evo
 lution using the initial halo parameters and the cross section. This method
  allows for more accurate estimates for the masses of SMBH seeds formed fro
 m SIDM halo core collapse\, offering a novel avenue for explaining the exis

 /p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Numerical simulation is a powerful tool for studying st
 ar formation\, where the interplay of many processes\, such as turbulence\,
  gravity and chemistry takes place. In this presentation\, I will discuss t
 wo topics in star formation simulation. First\, I will present our study on
  the relation between the core mass function (CMF) and the initial mass fun
 ction (IMF). We investigated the collapse of prestellar cores from gravitat
 ional fragmentation of turbulent converging flows\, using three dimensional
  hydrodynamic simulations. We reproduced the CMF inferred from Herschel obs
 ervations. However\, the CMF can not simply be translated to the IMF: A sig
 nificant fraction of low mass cores are gravitationally stable and will not
  collapse to form protostars\; and moreover\, without feedback\, protostars
  in our simulations accrete many times the initial core mass from the surro
 unding dense filaments. Second\, I will discuss the role of chemistry in mo
 lecular clouds. Although solving the time-dependent chemistry is necessary 
 for accurate abundances and temperature in the dynamic interstellar medium 
 (ISM)\, a full chemical network is too computationally expensive to incorpo
 rate in numerical simulations. To solve this problem\, we have developed an
 d tested a new simplified chemical network suitable for simulations of atom
 ic and molecular ISM. Applying this network to large scale ISM simulations\
 , we produced synthetic CO maps\, and investigated the X_CO conversion fact
 or in molecular clouds.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Christ Matzner</b></p>

 On the other hand\, the spins of theplanets are not generally well-aligned 
 with their orbital planes: for instance\, Earth's 23 degree misalignmentang
 le between its spin and orbit axes (the "planetary obliquity") gives rise t
 o our mild seasons. In particular\,the large obliquities of the giant plane
 ts (e.g. Uranus's 97 degree obliquity\, where its spin axis is nearly in th
 eplane of its orbit) have inspired many papers. Secular spin-orbit resonanc
 es\, where the precession rate ofthe planet's spin is commensurate with tha
 t of its orbit\, have frequently been invoked to tilt these planets.These r
 esonances\, responsible for the oft-studied "Cassini States"\, are also exp
 ected to affect the obliquitiesof stars and exoplanets. As the sample size 
 of stellar obliquities continues to grow in quality and quantity\,and as th
 e first constraints on exoplanet obliquities begin to arrive\, it is import
 ant to understand thedynamical processes that affect these obliquities in o
 rder to better infer the mechanisms responsible forgenerating the observed 
 distributions.\n\nIn this talk\, I will begin with an overview of secular s
 pin-orbit resonances and Cassini States\, then I will showthe signatures su
 ch resonances have on the obliquities of stars with distant (~300 AU) binar
 y companions\,and finally I will discuss the effects such resonances have o
 n the obliquities of exoplanets that aresufficiently close to their host st

 have helped us to make sense of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries in qui
 escence\, and of at least one young neutron star in a supernova remnant (Ca
 s A).  Fitting accurate models to well-constrained spectra of neutron stars
  at known distances allows us to place constraints on the mass and radius o

  State of Dense Matter</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Neutron stars are tiny stars
  with ultra-strong magnetic and gravitational fields and densities larger t
 han nuclear. Their small size and large average densities allow them to spi
 n at very rapid rates\, with surface velocities that are a large fraction o
 f the speed of light. The very large gravitational fields and relativistic 
 rotation rates make it necessary to use Einstein's theory of general relati
 vity to describe these stars. The pulsed X-ray emission from hot spots on t
 he surface of a rotating neutron star contains encoded information about th
 e neutron star's gravitational field and the properties of the spot's emiss
 ion pattern. Disentangling these effects in the pulsed emission seen by X-r
 ay timing observatories such as NICER\, ASTROSAT\, eXTP\, and STROBE-X will
  allow the determination of the neutron star's mass and radius\, leading (e
 ventually) to a determination of the neutron star equation of state. In thi
 s talk I will review some of the aspects of relativity that make rapidly ro
 tating neutron stars excellent targets for determining the equation of stat
 e of cold dense matter. I will introduce the method for extracting the neut
 ron star's properties from its observed waveform\, and discuss the types of
  neutron stars that NICER is observing\, and other larger-scale missions wi

 p>Abstract: The Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728 exhibits x-ray emission over a re
 gion 2 kpc in extent\, including a broad ~20\,000 km/s line at around 6 keV
  \, a slower ~1\,000 km/s outflow in [O III] and other low ionization state
  ions\, and a yet slower outflow in molecular gas. There is also a (possibl
 y narrow) Fe K alpha line at 6.4 keV\, and line emission around 7 keV. The 
 broad\, high velocity x-ray lines are similar to those that\, in other AGN\
 , are called ultra-fast outflows\, or UFOs. I will show that the Fe produci
 ng the broad line emission has to come from material that is not strongly c
 oupled to the ambient or outflowing gas. I will then argue that the line em
 itting atoms/ions are embedded in dust grains that are decoupled from the g
 as\, and driven outward by radiation pressure from the big blue bump of the
  central AGN. I will show that the grains can be accelerated in a time sign
 ificantly shorter than the grain sputtering time\, but that a substantial f
 raction (~10%) of the grain material will be sputtered off the grains\, gen

 t of the merging binary and the outer orbit are eccentric. We show key feat

 t are present in the phase shift\, and investigate the phase shift magnitud
 e and distribution of a population of three-body interactions typically occ

 peaks in the initial matter distribution\, and hence are a sensitive probe 
 of the amplitude of density fluctuations (sigma_8)\, the amount of matter i
 n the universe\, and the growth rate of structure. Cluster measurements hav
 e the potential to constrain dark energy and neutrino masses. However\, clu
 ster cosmology is currently limited by systematic uncertainties due to poor
 ly understood intracluster gas physics. I will present new statistical appr
 oaches to understand clusters and improve their cosmological constraining p
 ower through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. First\, I will de
 scribe a forthcoming first detection of the cross-correlation of the tSZ si
 gnal reconstructed from Planck data with the large-scale matter distributio
 n traced by the Planck CMB lensing potential. This statistic measures the a
 mount of hot gas found in moderately massive groups and clusters (M ~ 10^13
 -10^14.5 M_sun)\, a mass scale below that probed by direct cluster detectio
 ns. Second\, I will describe the first measurement of the PDF of the tSZ fi
 eld using ACT 148 GHz maps. This measurement contains information from all 
 (zero-lag) moments of the tSZ field\, beyond simply the 2- or 3-point funct
 ions. It is a very sensitive probe of sigma_8 and may also provide a method
  with which to break the degeneracy between sigma_8 and uncertainties in th
 e physics of the intracluster gas.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Amir Hajian</b></p>

 e relation of galaxies and its evolution has been well studied through opti
 cal and near-infrared (NIR) imaging. At z>3 these observations correspond t
 o blue rest-frame wavelengths\, tracing young stellar populations whose emi
 ssion is easily absorped by dust. To gain a full census of the distribution
  of young stars within galaxies it is thus important to also study the reso
 lved dust continuum emission\, the dust re-emitted light form young stars\,
  of said galaxies. Now that ALMA has reached its full capabilities\, the du
 st-continuum size of galaxies has been measured for a number of z > 2 sourc
 es. It is expected that in the next few years the dust continuum distributi
 on of galaxies will be observed on a more systematic basis accross the star
 -forming main-sequence and cosmic time. Available observations of SMGs and 
 the most massive main-sequence galaxies have suggested that the sub-mm cont
 inuum size of galaxies is smaller than the stellar size\, suggesting the bu
 ildup of a dust-obscured stellar component. Galaxy formation simulations su
 ch as IllustrisTNG50 now have the mass and spatial resolution to provide de
 tailed predictions for the dust-continuum size of thousands of main-sequenc
 e galaxies throughout cosmic time and compare these to sizes at any other w
 avelength and the underlying stellar\, gas\, SFR and dust distribution. We 
 have obtained resolved dust continuum maps of thousands of main-sequence ga
 laxies from z=1 to z=5 taken from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation\, by runnin
 g the model galaxies through the radiative transfer code SKIRT. In this tal
 k I will present the approach we took and specifically focus on an efficien
 t approach to assign a dust-mass to gas particles when the dust content is 
 not actually tracked within the simulations. I will then show 1) how the du
 st continuum mass-size relation of galaxies evolves\; 2) how the distributi
 on of optical/NIR and dust-continuum emission compares to the distribution 
 of star formation\; 3) that the observed dust-continuum emission of z>2 gal
 axies is more compact than the stellar emission and that this is a common f
 eature for main sequence galaxies\, especially for z>3 galaxies\; 4) that t
 his is the natural consequence of absorption of rest-frame optical emission
  by dust\, which dramatically changes the optical radial light profile of g
 alaxies\, and not necessarily the sign of the buildup of a dust-obscured de
 nse central stellar component. I will finish by discussing the implications
  of our results\, specifically focusing on how to best unravel the distribu
 tion of star-formation in high-redshift galaxies and insights for observati
 ons with the next generation of 30-meter ground and space-based observatori

 ntermediate statistics (e.g. the power spectrum) are usually measured and i
 nferences made by fitting models to these rather than the raw data\, assumi
 ng that the likelihood for these statistics has multivariate Gaussian form.
  The covariance matrix used to calculate the likelihood is often estimated 
 from simulations\, such that it is itself a random variable. This is a stan
 dard problem in Bayesian statistics\, which requires a prior to be placed o
 n the true model parameters and covariance matrix\, influencing the joint p
 osterior distribution. As an alternative to the commonly-used Independence-
 Jeffreys prior\, we introduce a prior that leads to a posterior that has ap
 proximately frequentist matching coverage. This is achieved by matching the
  covariance of the posterior to that of the distribution of true values of 
 the parameters around the maximum likelihood values in repeated trials\, un
 der certain assumptions. Using this prior\, credible intervals derived from
  a Bayesian analysis can be interpreted approximately as confidence interva
 ls\, containing the truth a certain proportion of the time for repeated tri
 als. Linking frequentist and Bayesian approaches that have previously appea
 red in the astronomical literature\, this offers a consistent and conservat
 ive approach for credible intervals quoted on model parameters for problems
  where the covariance matrix is itself an estimate.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Hongmi

  is our most important source of information about the\nearly universe. Man
 y of its features are in good agreement with the predictions of the so-call
 ed\nstandard model of cosmology -- the Lambda Cold Dark Matter Inflationary
  Big Bang Theory. However\, the\nlarge-angle fluctuations of the microwave 
 background are uncooperative with "the program" -- \nthey continue to exhib
 it several statistically significant anomalies. On the one hand\, if we loo
 k at the \nwhole sky the lowest multipoles seem to be correlated both with 
 each other and with the geometry \nof the solar system.  On the other hand\
 , when we look just at the part of the sky that we most trust – \nthe part 
 outside the galactic plane - there is a dramatic  lack of large angle corre
 lations. So much so \nthat it challenges basic predictions of the standard 
 model. We will discuss these anomalies and how we \nmight test whether they
  reflect profound underlying physics\, or just statistical flukes.</p>\n<p>

 general arguments\, I will show that the radio emission is coherent\, the m

  10^{14}Gauss or more. Recently\, an FRB was discovered in the Galaxy and i
 t confirmed that at least some FRBs are associated with magnetars. I will d

 ave proven vital to our understanding of cosmology\, both as standard candl
 es and for their role in the origin of the elements. They are now understoo
 d to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf\, but why shou

 ccretion" or "merger" scenarios\, with accretion models typically implying 
 a hot\, luminous phase prior to explosion. These objects are significant so
 urces of ionizing radiation\; therefore\, the environment surrounding SN Ia
  progenitors should be strongly ionized\, and traced by faint nebular emiss
 ion. Such "relic" nebulae should extend out to 10 -- 100 parsecs and linger
  for roughly the recombination timescale in the ISM (∼100\,000 years). In t
 his talk\, I'll show how the absence of a surrounding nebula excludes any a
 ccretion ("single-degenerate") channel for the origin of Tycho's supernova\
 , as well as other nearby remnants. Most variations on the merger ("double 
 degenerate") scenario remain viable. I'll also show how a similar test can 
 be applied to the integrated emission of old stellar populations\, ruling o

 n<p>Abstract: Encounters between stars and stellar remnants at the centers 
 of galaxies drive many important processes\, including generation of gravit
 ational waves via extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The fact that these
  encounters take place near a supermassive black hole (SMBH) turns out to b
 e important for two reasons: (1) The orbital motion is quasi-Keplerian\, so
  that correlations are maintained for much longer than in purely random enc
 ounters. (2) Relativity affects the motion\, through mechanisms like preces
 sion of the periastron\, frame-dragging\, and quadrupole torques.  The inte
 rplay between these processes is just now beginning to be understood\, base
 d on N-body simulations that contain a post-Newtonian representation of rel
 ativistic dynamics. A key result is that relativity can be crucially import
 ant even for orbits that extend outward to a substantial fraction of the SM
 BH influence radius\, by destroying the long-term correlations that would o
 therwise drive the evolution. I will discuss this work and its implications
  for the EMRI problem\, for experimental tests of theories of gravity\, and
  for the long-term evolution of galactic nuclei. \n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Fabio

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Star Formation Law in Nearby Galaxies</b></p>\
 n\n<p>Abstract: Star formation governs the secular evolution of galaxies.  
 Within galaxies\, we usually describe star formation in terms of an empiric
 al "law" that relates the local star formation rate to local conditions suc
 h as molecular gas density. While this model serves as a good first step\, 
 it breaks down beyond normal star-forming disk galaxies. In this talk\, I w
 ill show how the EDGE-CALIFA survey of CO emission allows a new dissection 
 of the star formation law using tools from the machine learning community. 
 This analysis illustrates the strong role of the old stellar population at 
 quenching star formation on a local scale.  Unfortunately\, the machine lea
 rning approach is empirical lacks a clear connection to the underlying phys
 ics.  To understand the physical effects at work\, I will show new results 
 from the PHANGS survey\, a large program with ALMA to map a 74 nearby galax
 ies at high (<100 pc) resolution. One immediate result we see from the PHAN
 GS data is that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time is close t
 o theoretical expectations (0.5%) and shows suggestive variations across th
 e sample.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Patrick Breysse</b></p>

 >\n\n<p>Abstract: The Kepler mission’s census of transiting exoplanets has 
 shown that sub-Neptune size planets with short orbital periods are extremel
 y common. Given their small sizes\, the properties of these planets can be 
 difficult or impossible to constrain via radial velocity observations. Mutu
 al gravitational interactions in multi-planet systems cause variations in t
 he arrival times of planets’ transits. These variations are a valuable prob
 e for measuring planets’ masses and eccentricities\, thereby constraining t
 heir compositions and formation histories. I will discuss the results of ou
 r analysis of the transit timing variations (TTVs) of 145 Kepler planets fr
 om 55 multi-planet systems.  Numerical studies of stability in multi-planet
  systems suggest that\, given the typical masses and eccentricities inferre
 d via TTVs\, many high-multiplicity Kepler systems are on the verge of dyna
 mical instability. This suggests that many members of the present-day plane
 tary system population may have started out with similarly high multiplicit
 ies but suffered instabilities on somewhat shorter timescales\, leaving beh
 ind a range of lower-multiplicity outcomes.  A better theoretical understan
 ding of dynamical stability in such systems can help relate the present-day
  distribution of planetary system architectures to those produced by the pl
 anet formation process. I will describe a new analytic criterion for predic
 ting the dynamical stability of two-planet systems. This stability criterio
 n\, based on the idea of resonance overlap\, provides important insights in
 to how a complex web of resonances mediates the dynamical stability of high
 er-multiplicity systems like those observed by Kepler.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Dan

 back\; since most quasars do not have powerful jets\, winds are currently t

 with halo masses greater than 1.e12 or so. The mass\, momentum\, and energy
  outflow rates of these winds are hard to determine observationally\, but i
 f the physics driving the outflows can be nailed down\, the estimates can b
 e firmed up. Quasar spectra are dominated by broad (~5\,000 km/s) emission 
 (and less frequently\, absorption) lines of Lithium-like ions of H\, C\, N\
 , O\, and Si\; the latter 4 ions have strong doublet ground state transitio
 n\, i.e.\, two lines separated by 400-1000 km/s. Surveys yielding tens to h
 undreds of thousands of quasar spectra have shown that about half of quasar
 s exhibit narrow (< 500km/s) blue-shifted (hence outflowing) absorption lin
 es\, and about a third show broad (>3000 km/s) absorption lines\; the latte

 500km/s. I will explain how this "line locking" arises\, and show that it d
 emonstrates that the outflow\, both narrow and broad\, are driven almost ex
 clusively by radiation pressure\, ruling out significant contributions from
  both hot shocked gas\, and from Blandford-Payne type magnetic driving.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>A Dynamical Picture of Failed Supernovae</b></p>\n
 \n<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that nature generates core-collapse superno
 vae on a daily basis\, stellar explosions are not easily produced from firs
 t principles. In particular\, the neutron star ``bounce'' paradigm -- where
 in the overpressured neutron star formed during core collapse launches a sh
 ock that unbinds the overlying envelope -- has been shown to fail in most c
 ases\, as the ram pressure of infalling material causes the shock to stall 
 at small radii. If nothing revives this stalled shock\, the continued accre
 tion of mass onto the central core results in the formation of a black hole
 \, and the black hole swallows the star in a ``failed supernova.'' In this 
 talk\, I will discuss a mechanism\, triggered by neutrino production during
  the formation of the neutron star\, that is responsible for producing a se
 cond\, weak shock (distinct from the neutron star bounce shock) in the oute
 r layers of the dying star in a failed supernova. When the progenitor of a 
 failed supernova is a supergiant\, this second shock forms at the base of t
 he hydrogen envelope\, and propagates through another 2-3 decades in radius
  before reaching the photosphere. I will present a new class of self-simila
 r solutions that describes the propagation of this weak shock in the hydrog
 en envelope of the star. I will make comparisons to simulations of shock pr
 opagation in failed supernovae\, and show that these self-similar solutions
  reproduce both the evolution of the shock itself and the post-shock veloci
 ty\, density\, and pressure extremely accurately. I will discuss the implic
 ations of these findings for mass ejection and late-time fallback from fail
 ed supernovae.</p>\n

 \n<p>Abstract: In the LCDM model\, dark matter halos and light-emitting gal
 axies form hierarchically by mergers but grow also via direct accretion of 
 "smooth" material. I will describe the analysis I performed on cosmological
  N-body simulations in order to quantify the growth modes of dark matter ha

 \, accretion\, which is found to be significant. This is in good agreement 
 with observations of massive star-forming galaxies at z~2 that indicate tha
 t the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history are dominated by co
 ntinuous accretion of gas. Finally\, I will present high-resolution\, "zoom

 ary White Dwarfs</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In compact white dwarf (WD) binary
  systems (with periods ranging from minutes to hours)\, dynamical tides inv
 olving the excitation and dissipation of gravity waves play a dominant role
  in determining the physical conditions (such as rotation rate and temperat
 ure) of the WDs prior to mass transfer or binary merger.  We calculate the 
 amplitude of the tidally excited gravity waves as a function of the tidal f
 orcing frequency for realistic WD models\, under the assumption that the ou
 tgoing propagating waves are efficiently dissipated in outer layer of the s
 tar by nonlinear wave breaking.  In our WD models\, gravity waves are launc
 hed at composition gradients and propagate outwards.  We study the effects 
 of dynamical tides on the long-term evolution of WD binaries prior to mass 
 transfer or merger. Above a critical orbital frequency\, corresponding to a
 n orbital period of about one hour (depending on WD models)\, dynamical tid
 es efficiently drive the WD towards synchronous rotation\, although a small
 \, almost constant degree of asynchronization is maintained even at the sma
 llest binary periods. We also investigate the effect of tidal heating on th
 e WD (e.g.\, its internal structure\, surface temperature\, luminosity\, et
 c.) by including tidal heating in stellar evolution calculations. We compar
 e our predictions to observations of compact WD systems such as the 12.75 m
 inute system SDSS J0651+2844\, and we discuss the implications. Finally\, w
 e examine the possibility that tidal heating may trigger run-away hydrogen 
 shell burning on the surface of a WD\, leading to a nova-like event before 
 the WD merging event.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Francois Foucart</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Recoiling super-massive black holes\, a search in 
 the nearby universe</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Anisotropic emission of gravita
 tional waves during the coalescence of supermassive black hole binaries can
  deliver a large ``kick" velocity to the new BH (v~10^3 km/s). N-body simul
 ations predict that\, for kick velocities larger than 40% of the galactic e
 scape velocity\, the BH may experience long lived (few Gyr) oscillations wi
 th amplitudes comparable with the size of the galactic core (~10^2 pc)\, su
 ggesting that BHs offset from the galactic centers may be common\, even in 
 nearby ellipticals. In order to search for such offsets\, we perform a hoto
 metric analysis of a sample of "core" elliptical galaxies using HST observa
 tions. Typical recovered offsets are within 1% of the core radius. In contr
 ast\, statistical arguments based on N-body simulations show that the typic
 al probability to observe an offset larger than 0.1 core radii (~10 pc) is 
 of order\nof 70% for a single galaxy. This is derived under the assumption 
 that the BH binary coalescence produced a moderately large kick (v ~ 250 km
 /s) at the time of the last merger. Assuming that all galaxies in the sampl
 e experienced at least one such merger during their lifetime\, the probabil
 ity to observe no offsets larger than 1% the core radius over the sample is
  of order of 10^-8.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Fabio</b></p>

 es of these planet populations. Firstly\, observations indicate that just l
 ike our solar system\, giant planets are preferentially present at intermed
 iate distances (1 - 10 au) from their host stars. I will show how dust dyna
 mics and differences in grain properties across the water ice line create a
  region at intermediate distances where gas accretion is rapid\, which faci
 litates the formation of giant planets. Secondly\, long-term RV campaigns r
 eveal that cold giant planets are almost always accompanied by close-in sup
 er-Earths. In defiance of early expectations and previous work\, I will dem
 onstrate that protoplanetary disks that are capable of forming cold giant p
 lanets are also capable of spawning close-in super-Earths\, thereby natural
 ly producing the observed correlation. Thirdly\, close-in super-Earths are 
 more common and giant planets are increasingly rare around lower mass stars
 . I will present some ongoing work that interprets these observations in li
 ght of the accretion efficiency of pebbles (mm-cm sized dust) that form the
  cores of these planets in different regions of protoplanetary disks.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The formation and evolution of giant planets</b></
 p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The large number of extra-solar planets discovered over 
 the last two decades shows the existence\nof a huge diversity in their prop
 erties.  This diversity is suggestive that multiple different\nformation an
 d evolution mechanisms exist to cause planets to be born out of their circu
 mstellar\ndisc material and evolve to the state in which we observe them to
 day.  I will discuss both the\ncore accretion and gravitational instability
  formation scenaria.\n\nThe core accretion process is thought to occur at s
 maller disc radii (up to approximately 5-10AU)\nwhile the gravitational ins
 tability process is thought to occur at large radii (outside\napproximately
  70AU).  Therefore an intermediate radial range exists where no one formati
 on\nmechanism adequately describes the in situ formation of planets.  I wil
 l discuss both formation\nscenaria in light of recent numerical simulations
  and show that these developments are starting to\n"bridge the gap" between
  the two mechanisms.  I will also discuss the migration of planets\, with\n
 specific reference to planets born in gravitationally unstable discs.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>From the supernova to the supernova remnant</b></p
 >\n\n<p>Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the outcome of supernovae\,
  cataclysmic explosions that mark the death of massive stars (core-collapse
  supernovae\, observationally labeled type II or type Ib/c)\, or the “secon
 d death” of white dwarfs (thermonuclear supernovae\, observationally labele
 d type Ia). Supernova remnants are a key link between the stars and the int
 erstellar medium in the Galaxy. The large blast wave generated by the explo
 sion disseminates the elements synthesized inside the star and during the e
 xplosion\, that become the building blocks for new stars and planets. The p
 owerful blast wave heats the ISM\, amplifies hydrodynamic and magneto-hydro
 dynamic turbulence\, and accelerates charged particles – SNR shocks are bel
 ieved to be the main sources of “cosmic rays”\, very energetic particles th
 at pervade the Galaxy.\nHowever the explosion mechanism of supernovae is st
 ill unclear. For core-collapse supernovae\, the only successful self-consis
 tent simulations have so far failed to reproduce the required energetics. T
 he role of instabilities and neutrinos has not been elucidated. For thermon
 uclear supernovae\, it is unknown whether they are produced by single-degen
 erate progenitors\, via accretion\, or by double-generate progenitors\, via
  mergers – or a mixture of both. Yet they are routinely used as standard ca
 ndles for cosmology. A very interesting question is to what extent and for 
 how long the supernova remnant bears the signature of the initial explosion
 . Can we use SNRs as probes for supernova physics?\nWe have previously deve
 loped a code for the simulation of the morphological and spectral evolution
  of young supernova remnants in three dimensions\, including the effects of
  efficient particle acceleration at the blast wave and the development of h
 ydrodynamical instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor) at the edge of the ejecta. We
  are now working in our group on bridging supernova studies and supernova r
 emnant studies\, and I will present first results for a remnant evolved fro
 m the output of a state-of-the art simulation of a thermonuclear supernova 
 (a delayed detonation of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf).\n</p>\n<p>Host:

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>New Insights on Galaxy Formation from Comparing Si
 mulations and Observations</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Computer simulations and
  theoretical understanding have now reached a stage where high-resolution c
 osmological simulations are increasingly able to tackle the complexity of g
 alaxy formation and evolution.  This talk will start by summarizing new res
 ults from analysis of cosmic large scale structure simulations including Bo
 lshoi-Planck and MultiDark-Planck and our recent papers on the galaxy-halo 
 connection. In particular\, we have investigated the possibility that the s
 tar formation rate of many star-forming galaxies reflects their dark matter
  halo’s mass accretion rate.  I will then describe successes and challenges
  of high-resolution zoom-in hydrodynamic galaxy simulations in trying to un
 derstand the Hubble Space Telescope observations of galaxies during the per
 iod of most vigorous star formation (redshifts 1 to 3\, “Cosmic High Noon”)
  in CANDELS.  Most astronomers used to think that galaxies form as disks\, 
 that forming galaxies are pretty smooth\, and that galaxies generally grow 
 in radius as they grow in mass — but CANDELS and other observations have sh
 own that all these statements are wrong.  The majority of star-forming gala
 xies at z > 1 have mostly elongated (prolate) stellar distributions rather 
 than disks or spheroids\, and our simulations explain why: stars initially 
 form along the prolate central regions of dark matter halos.  A large fract
 ion of star-forming galaxies at redshifts 1 < z < 3 are found to have massi
 ve stellar clumps\; these originate from phenomena including disk instabili
 ties in our simulations and in our semi-analytic models.  Such instabilitie
 s\, often triggered by mergers\, lead to rapid gas inflows and central star
 bursts that reduce the half-light radius (a phenomenon that we call “galaxy
  compaction”) and that also help to create compact spheroids (“nuggets”).  
 Our simulations rather accurately reproduce observed evolution of galaxies 
 in radius and time\, and comparisons of our zoom-in galaxy simulations with
  CANDELS observations using machine learning methods suggest that galaxies 
 indeed typically evolve through prolate-to-nugget-to-disk phases at the sam
 e stellar masses as in our simulations.  We are also trying to understand h
 ow angular momentum evolves as gas falls toward the inner galaxy and become
 s stars\, what halo parameters affect the stellar radius of galaxies\, and 
 how disk galaxies decrease their ratio of gas velocity dispersion to rotati
 on velocity and settle into thin disks by the present epoch.  The Assemblin
 g Galaxies of Resolved Anatomy (AGORA) collaboration compares simulations o
 f the same initial conditions using most of the best codes\; the 2018 AGORA
  project focuses on the circumgalactic medium and star-forming clumps in co
 smological zoom-in simulations.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Probing fundamental physics and cosmic structure w

 he cosmic microwave background (CMB) have proven to be a powerful probe of 
 the physics of our universe. CMB observations are helping to address fundam
 ental questions\, such as the nature of dark energy and dark matter\, and a
 re being used to probe the physics of inflation at energies a trillion time
 s higher than the Large Hadron Collider. Recent measurements led to several
  exciting first detections\, including CMB lensing\, massive galaxy cluster
 s\, the large-scale velocity field\, and the B-mode component of the polari
 zation field. These results have been enabled by the development of superco
 nducting detectors and optics instrumentation\, but we are now approaching 
 the limits of current telescope facilities. Continuing advances in CMB rese
 arch require greater sensitivity through major gains in optical throughput.
 \n\nThe CCAT-prime extreme field-of-view submillimeter telescope on Cerro C
 hajnantor will meet this challenge. The six-meter aperture telescope is des
 igned to observe between 350um - 3mm and is capable of mapping the CMB roug
 hly 10x faster than current observatories\, making it a potential platform 
 for the next generation “Stage IV” CMB survey. The first light instrument w
 ill take advantage of the unique CCAT-prime capabilities and site to charac
 terize cluster velocities and CMB polarization. In addition\, CCAT-prime wi
 ll enable spectroscopic intensity mapping of [CII] from early stars and gal
 axies during reionization and low-redshift galactic ecology. We discuss the
 se advances and consider whether future intensity mapping surveys may const
 rain primordial non-Gaussianities beyond the reach of CMB measurements\, pr

  of planet formation. This population exhibits predictable hallmarks of arc
 hitectural regularity and uniformity\, such as low eccentricities and incli

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>High Luminosity Accretion onto Black Holes:  How t
 he Physics Really Works</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Models for the brightest st
 ates of black hole X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei have all been 
 fundamentally based on the classic Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk model of 
 the 1970's. Unfortunately \, this model is plagued by fundamental physics u
 ncertainties that have stymied efforts to understand the central accretion 
 flow in these systems. Modern radiation MHD simulations of magnetorotationa
 l turbulence have now revealed how the dynamics and thermodynamics of these
  flows really work. As assumed by Shakura and Sunyaev\, turbulent stresses 
 do in fact scale with radiation pressure\, but only on long time scales. Mo
 reover\, the causal nature of this relation is from stress to pressure\, no
 t the other way around. Even though radiation dominated\, the inner parts o
 f the accretion flow are thermally stable. Heat is transported outward most
 ly by radiative diffusion\, although at the highest luminosities\, advectio
 n of radiation caused by locally buoyant\, finite amplitude magnetic fluctu
 ations arising within the MHD dynamo is competitive. The physics we have no
 w understood may help explain the origins of the enigmatic steep power law 
 state of black hole X-ray binaries. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Shane Davis</b></p>

 mass\, accreting black hole occasionally exhibit rapid variability\, at fre
 quencies of roughly ~50-450 Hz. These `high-frequency\, quasi-periodic osci
 llations' (HFQPOs) attract significant theoretical interest because their f

 regarding a particular family of magnetohydrodynamic waves that can be exci

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Effective potentials and morphological transitions
  for binary black-hole spin precession</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Generic bina
 ry black holes have spins that are misaligned with their orbital angular mo
 mentum.  When the binary separation between the black holes is large compar
 ed to their gravitational radii\, the timescale on which the spins precess 
 is much shorter than the radiation-reaction time on which the orbital angul
 ar momentum decreases due to gravitational-wave emission.  We use conservat
 ion of the total angular momentum and the projected effective spin on the p
 recession time to derive an effective potential for BBH spin precession.  T
 his effective potential allows us to solve the orbit-averaged spin-precessi
 on equations analytically for arbitrary mass ratios and spins.  These solut
 ions are quasiperiodic functions of time: after a precessional period the s
 pins return to their initial relative orientations.  We classify black-hole
  spin precession into three distinct morphologies between which the black h
 oles can transition during their inspiral.  Our new solutions constitute fu
 ndamental progress in our understanding of black-hole spin precession and a
 lso have important applications to astrophysical black holes.  We derive a 
 precession-averaged evolution equation that can be numerically integrated o
 n the radiation-reaction time\, allowing us to statistically track black-ho
 le spins from formation to merger.  This will greatly help us predict the s
 ignatures of black-hole formation in the gravitational waves emitted near m
 erger and the distributions of final spins and gravitational recoils.</p>\n

 ese jets emerge from the star with Lorentz factors \\gamma of a few hundred
  and opening angles \\theta <~ 0.1 radians. Achromatic breaks in GRB afterg
 low light curves indicate that \\gamma\\theta >> 1. However\, magnetohydrod
 ynamic (MHD) simulations of collimated jets generally give \\gamma\\theta <
 ~ 1\, indicating a conflict between these models and observations. In this 
 talk we present a new class of MHD jet simulations in which the simulated j
 et is confined by a GRB progenitor star\, modeled as a rigid confining wall
  that extends out to a certain radius. Beyond this radius\, the jet becomes
  deconfined. We find that the onset of deconfinement outside the star cause
 s a burst of acceleration with negligible change in the opening angle. In o
 ur fiducial model with a stellar radius equal to 10^4.5 times that of the c
 entral compact object\, the jet achieves an asymptotic \\gamma ~ 500 far ou
 tside the star and an asymptotic \\theta ~ 0.04 rad\, giving \\gamma\\theta
  ~ 20. These values are consistent with observations of typical long-durati
 on GRBs and explain the occurrence of jet breaks within the context of MHD 
 jets. </p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>On the Origin of Retrograde Hot Jupiters - New Ins
 ights from Triple Systems</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The search for extra-sola
 r planets has led to the surprising discovery\nof many Jupiter-like planets
  in very close proximity to their host\nstar\, the so-called ``hot Jupiters
 ''. Even more surprising\, many of\nthese hot Jupiters have orbits that are
  eccentric or highly inclined\nwith respect to the equator of the star\, an
 d some (about 25%) even\norbiting counter to the spin direction of the star
 . This poses a\nunique challenge to all planet formation models. We show th
 at secular\ninteractions between Jupiter-like planet and another perturber 
 in the\nsystem can easily produce retrograde HJ orbits. Specifically\, we\n
 consider new developments in the frame of work of secular hierarchical\ntri
 ple system (the so-called Kozai-Lidov mechanism). Specifically\, we\nshow t
 hat the inner orbit's angular momentum component parallel to the\ntotal ang
 ular momentum (i.e.\, the z-component of the inner orbit\nangular momentum)
  need not be constant. In fact\, it can even change\nsign\, leading to a re
 trograde orbit. A brief excursion to very high\neccentricity during the cha
 otic evolution of the inner orbit allows\nplanet-star tidal interactions to
  rapidly circularize that orbit\,\ndecoupling the planets and forming a ret
 rograde hot Jupiter. We\nestimate the relative frequencies of retrograde or
 bits and counter to\nthe stellar spin orbits using Monte Carlo simulations\
 , and find that\nthey are consistent with the observations. The high observ
 ed incidence\nof planets orbiting counter to the stellar spin direction may
  suggest\nthat three body secular interactions are an important part of the
 ir\ndynamical history.\n     Interestingly\, this mechanism is applicable t
 o many other\nastrophysical settings\; few will be mentioned.</p>\n<p>Host:

  depends both on the supply of gas and the efficiency at which that gas is 
 converted into stars\; both these factors vary with galactic mass. To study
  these processes together\, galaxy simulations require a model for gas loss
  from stellar feedback and a star formation prescription tied to the molecu

 gen-based star formation to examine how star formation histories vary with 
 halo mass. The resulting galaxies have rising rotation curves and realistic
  stellar masses and gas fractions. I will discuss how stellar feedback redu

 laxies and how the efficiency of that gas loss is affected by the ISM model
 . Additionally\, I will compare the gas outflows from galaxies of different

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Tides in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</b></p>\
 n\n<p>Abstract: Within the next few years\, advanced versions of ground-bas
 ed gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO and Virgo are expected to 
 detect the first gravitational waves from the merger of neutron star binari
 es. Tidal interactions in such systems extract energy from the orbit and\, 
 at some level\, modify the gravitational wave signal.  Previous studies fou
 nd that tidal effects are probably too small to be detected with advanced L
 IGO and Virgo.  However\, these studies typically assumed that the tide can
  be treated as a linear perturbation to the star.  In this talk I will show
  that the linear approximation is invalid even during the early stages of i
 nspiral and that nonlinear effects might become important around the time t

 nonlinear effects is not yet well constrained\, I will show that they may s

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Large-scale magnetic-field generation in turbulent
  black-hole accretion disks.</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Jetted astrophysical p
 henomena with black hole (BH) engines\, including binary mergers\, jetted t
 idal disruption events (TDE)\, and X-ray binaries\, require a large-scale v
 ertical magnetic field for efficient jet formation. I will present a possib
 le mechanism for generating these crucial magnetic fields in accretion disk
 s identified using 3D global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (MH
 D) simulations of accretion disks. My investigation unveils that the dynamo
  mechanism can be best understood as a nonlinear outcome of the magnetorota
 tional instability (MRI). We characterize the complete dynamo mechanism wit
 h two timescales: one for local magnetic field generation and one for large
 -scale advection. Finally\, I compare the timescales for jet launching with
  observations of gamma-ray bursts and jetter TDEs. The description and unde
 rstanding of the dynamo mechanism pave the way toward a better understandin
 g of jet launching in different astrophysical systems.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Bar

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Cosmological hydrogen recombination: The effect of
  extremely high-n states and quadrupole transitions</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract:
  Thanks to the ongoing Planck mission\, a new window will be opened on the 
 properties of the primordial density field\, the cosmological parameters\, 
 and the physics of reionization. Much of Planck's new leverage on these qua
 ntities will come from temperature measurements at small angular scales and
  from polarization measurements. These both depend on the details of cosmol
 ogical hydrogen recombination\; use of the CMB as a probe of energies great
 er than 10^16 GeV compels us to get the ~eV scale atomic physics right.\n\n
 One question that remains is how high in hydrogen principle quantum number 
 we have to go to make sufficiently accurate predictions for Planck. Using s
 parse matrix methods to beat computational difficulties\, I have modeled th
 e influence of very high (up to and including n=200) excitation states of a
 tomic hydrogen on the recombination history of the primordial plasma\, reso
 lving all angular momentum sub-states separately and including\, for the fi
 rst time\, the effect of hydrogen quadrupole transitions. I will review the
  basic physics\, explain the resulting plasma properties\, discuss recombin
 ation histories\, and close by discussing the effects on CMB observables.</

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Large scale structure formation with the Schroding
 er method</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: When describing large-scale structure for
 mation of collisionless dark matter one is interested in the dynamics of a 
 large collection of identical point particles that interact only gravitatio
 nally. Via gravitational instability initially small density perturbations 
 evolve into eventually bound structures\, like dark matter halos that are d
 istributed along the cosmic web. Even though this problem seems quite simpl
 e from a conceptual point of view\, no sufficiently general solution of the
  underlying equation\, the collisionless Boltzmann equation coupled to the 
 Poisson equation\, is known. Therefore one usually has to resort to N-body 
 simulations which tackle the problem numerically. Analytical methods to des
 cribe structure formation are in general based on the dust model which desc
 ribes cold dark matter as a pressureless fluid characterized by density and
  velocity. This model works quite well up to the quasi-linear regime but ev
 entually fails when multiple streams form that are especially important for
  halo formation but lead to singularities in the model. We employ the so-ca
 lled Schrödinger method to develop a model which is able to describe multi-
 streaming and therefore can serve as theoretical N-body double and replacem
 ent for the dust model.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marcelo Alvarez</b></p>

  probe the innermost structures right down to the innermost stable circular
  orbit and event horizon around the supermassive black holes in AGN. By mea
 suring the emissivity profile of the accretion disc\, that is its pattern o
 f illumination by the coronal X-ray source\, along with reverberation time 
 lags between variability in the X-ray continuum and reflection\, it has pro
 ven possible to measure the geometry and spatial extend of the corona that 
 produces the X-ray continuum when the observed data are combined with insig
 ht gained from general relativistic ray tracing simulations.\nI will discus
 s how detailed analysis of the X-ray emission allows us to trace\, for the 
 first time\, from observations\, the evolution of the X-ray emitting corona
  that gives rise to the extreme variability seen in the X-ray emission from
  AGN. We detect expansion in the corona as well as variations in its energe
 tics as the X-ray flux increases\, which gives us insight into the physical
  processes by which energy is liberated from black hole accretion flows and
  allows observational constraints to be placed upon theoretical models of b
 lack hole accretion flows and associated coronae.\nThe detailed analysis of
  X-ray reflection and reverberation that will be possible with the next gen
 eration of X-ray telescopes promises to reveal a much more detailed\, dynam
 ic picture of the physical processes at work on the inner regions of accret
 ion flow. I will discuss how\, in particular\, energy-resolved measurements
  of X-ray reverberation promise to reveal a 3D image of inner regions of th

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Late-Time Formation and Dynamical Signatures o
 f Small Planets</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The Kepler mission has established 
 that approximately half of all Sun-like stars harbor planets. Of these\, cl
 ose-in super-Earths are the most common. Understanding the origin of super-
 Earths can lend us insight into the default pathway of planet formation. Th
 e riddle posed by super-Earths is that they are not Jupiters: their core ma
 sses are large enough to trigger runaway gas accretion\, yet somehow super-
 Earths accreted atmospheres that weigh only a few percent of their total ma
 ss. I will show that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths formed late\, in
  the inner cavities of transitional disks. Super-puffs present the inverse 
 problem of being too voluminous for their small masses. I will show that su
 per-puffs most easily acquire their thick atmospheres as dust-free\, rapidl
 y cooling worlds outside 1 AU\, and then migrate in just after super-Earths
  appear. Small planets may remain ubiquitous out to large orbital distances
 . I will demonstrate that the variety of debris disk morphologies revealed 
 by scattered light images can be explained by viewing an eccentric disk\, s
 ecularly forced by a planet of just a few Earth masses\, from different obs
 erving angles. The farthest reaches of planetary systems may be perturbed b
 y eccentric super-Earths.</p>\n

 stand the origins of galaxies\, stars and planets is still fundamental\, we
  have begun to realize that chemistry plays an important role in understand
 ing the universe. The dynamical and physical evolution of a  cloud of inter
 stellar gas on its way to becoming a star and planetary system is also acco
 mpanied by an evolution of chemical species which play an important role in
  regulating this process.  In this talk I will present results from the Her

 ep in interstellar space.  In particular\, I will present results from a co
 mprehensive spectral survey toward Orion South\; a massive star forming reg
 ion in the Orion Nebula.   Using these data\, I will show how we found evid
 ence for three physically different cloud components.  Based on a comprehen
 sive chemical abundance comparison with the nearby massive star forming reg
 ion Orion KL\, I will also show that Orion South is chemically less evolved
  and\, therefore\, a much younger star forming region than Orion KL.</p>\n<

 in the same direction as it\, and remain roughly 60 degrees ahead of or beh

 referred to as 'retrograde' motion) but is also safely sharing Jupiter's or

 atter - Implications for DM detection experiments</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: P
 roperties of dark matter (DM)\, determined through direct and indirect dete
 ction experiments\, depend on synergies between astrophysics and particle p
 hysics. For example\, the density and velocity distribution function of the
  dark matter in our neighborhood is crucial in determining the collision ra
 tes in DM direct detection experiments. Unfortunately\, there is a wide dis
 persion of observationally determined DM density (and profiles)\; moreover\
 , the `standard halo model (SHO)'\, unfavored by observations and simulatio
 ns\, is predominantly used by the particle physics community. Using some of
  the latest compilation of rotation curve data\, we make the first ever obs
 ervational estimate of the DM phase-space of the Milky Way halo up to 200 K
 pc (i.e almost r200). Our results bring out deviations from the SHO as well
  as differences from numerical simulation predictions\, and points to the i
 mportance of precise determination of visible matter density and the local 
 standard of rest. Finally\, we make some comments on the prospects of impro
 ving our current knowledge of Milky Way DM using data from GAIA\, and a fut
 ure mission called THEIA.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Alexander van Engelen</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Simulating the formation of massive star clusters<
 /b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Star cluster formation is a challenging multi-physi
 cs problem to simulate: stars form in molecular clouds in which gravity\, s
 upersonic MHD turbulence\, radiative cooling and heating\, ISM chemistry\, 
 and stellar feedback all have a role to play. I will present a novel numeri
 cal approach to this problem adapted from the Feedback in Realistic Environ
 ments (FIRE) simulations. I will describe these physics methods and their i
 mplications for cluster formation in turn. I will then present the results 
 of a suite of cloud collapse simulations that survey a wide range of ISM co
 nditions to elucidate the connection between galactic environments and the 
 star clusters that form in them. Due to stellar feedback\, the star formati
 on efficiency (SFE) of a virialized cloud is mainly an increasing function 
 of its surface density\, similar to the trend observed between local molecu
 lar clouds and dense clumps. The mass of bound star clusters surviving the 
 embedded phase is subsequently a function of this SFE\, and an initial clus
 ter mass function dN/dM ~ M^{-2} emerges from the dynamics of turbulent fra
 gmentation. The bound star clusters formed in the simulations are remarkabl
 y similar in shape to observed young massive clusters\; I will show that th
 is structure emerges naturally from the process of hierarchical assembly fr
 om fragmented subclusters.</p>\n

 agnetosphere solutions. We further provide a self-consistent model for the 
 spin-down of intermittent pulsars\, pulsars which appear to transition betw

  creates a strong\, highly organized magnetic field parallel to the disk pl

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Uber-Gravity and H0 tension</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract
 : Recently\, the idea of taking ensemble average over gravity models has be
 en introduced. Based on this idea\, we study the ensemble average over (eff
 ectively) all the gravity models dubbing the name uber-gravity which is a f
 ixed point in the model space. The uber-gravity has interesting universal p
 roperties\, independent from the choice of basis: i) it mimics Einstein-Hil
 bert gravity for high-curvature regime\, ii) it predicts stronger gravitati
 onal force for an intermediate-curvature regime\, iii) surprisingly\, for l
 ow-curvature regime\, i.e. R<R0 where R is Ricci scalar and R0 is a given s
 cale\, the Lagrangian vanishes automatically and iiii) there is a sharp tra
 nsition between low- and intermediate-curvature regimes at R=R0.\nFinally\,
  we will study the cosmology of this model and argue it can reduce to a cos
 mology model named "either Lambda or CDM" which is even simpler than standa
 rd LCDM. This model can address H0 tension and is distinguishable from LCDM
  in its prediction for the perturbations.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>I-Sheng Yang</b>

 at: can accumulate in an atmosphere against atmospheric radicals and other 
 sinks\; has strong atmospheric spectral features\; and has limited abiologi

 for identification of exoplanet atmosphere biosignature gases\, we are now 
 confronted with two severe practical challenges. First\, tiny signals from 
 small exoplanet atmospheres and the underlying highly averaged atmospheric 
 information means we have to resort to statistical inference. Second\, M dw

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The Dark Side of Dark Matter</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstrac
 t: The nature of dark matter is one of the major "known unknowns" of physic
 s of the universe.  From astronomical observations\, we know that dark matt
 er exists\, makes up 23% of the mass budget of the universe\, clusters stro
 ngly to form the load-bearing frame of structure for galaxy formation\, and
  hardly interacts with ordinary matter  Although most of what we know about
  dark matter comes from astronomy\, most of the effort now to characterize 
 dark matter is focused on non-gravitational interactions between dark matte
 r and standard-model particles. However\, dark matter may live in a new\, d
 ark sector of physics with only tenuous connections to the standard model. 
  The challenge is to learn about the physics of this new sector without rel
 ying on measurable non-gravitational interactions with the standard model. 
 In this talk\, I argue that astronomical searches can elucidate some of the
  dark physics of dark matter.  I will show how the physics within a new dar
 k sector may imprint itself on the formation and growth of cosmological str
 ucture in the universe\, which may then be probed using the gravitational i
 nteractions between dark matter and standard-model particles.  I will outli
 ne which currently existing data sets can provide interesting constraints a
 lready\, and what kinds of theoretical and observational work should be don

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Resonant Shattering of Neutron Star Crusts</b></p>
 \n\n<p>Abstract: The resonant excitation of neutron star (NS) modes by tide
 s is investigated as a source of short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) precursors. W
 e find that the driving of a crust-core interface mode can lead to shatteri
 ng of the NS crust\, liberating ~10^46-10^47 erg of energy seconds before t
 he merger of a NS-NS or NS-black hole binary. Such properties are consisten
 t with Swift/BAT detections of sGRB precursors\, and we use the timing of t
 he observed precursors to place weak constraints on the crust equation of s
 tate. We describe how a larger sample of precursor detections could be used
  alongside coincident gravitational wave detections of the  inspiral by Adv
 anced LIGO class detectors to probe the NS structure. These two types of ob
 servations nicely complement one another\, since the former constrains the 
 equation of state and structure near the crust-core boundary\, while the la
 tter is more sensitive to the core equation of state. I will also discuss s
 hattering flares as electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave burs
 ts during parabolic and elliptic encounters in dense star clusters.</p>\n<p

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Nature’s Death Stars: A Discussion of Supermassive
  Black Holes\, Relativistic Jets\, and The Event Horizon Telescope.</b></p>
 \n\n<p>Abstract: What are relativistic jets made of? The answer is central 
 to our understanding of how supermassive black holes influence their surrou
 nding galactic environments. In this talk I will present my research on the
  composition of relativistic jets (and in particular blazars) within the co
 ntext of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration.\n\nBlazars repres
 ent an extreme subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\, in which an accre
 ting supermassive black hole launches and powers a relativistic jet of magn
 etized plasma that is closely aligned to our line-of-sight. Blazar jets: (i
 ) shine across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (from low-frequency radi
 o waves to high-energy gamma-rays)\, (ii) exhibit dramatic flares\, and (ii
 i) dominate the high-energy extragalactic sky. Very long baseline interfero
 metric (VLBI) arrays (such as phased ALMA \\& The Event Horizon Telescope) 
 are capable of imaging the polarized synchrotron emission emanating from th
 e innermost regions of relativistic blazar jets with unprecedented angular 
 resolution and sensitivity. In particular\, the linearly and circularly pol
 arized synchrotron emission from blazars carry imprints of both the strengt
 h and orientation of the collimating magnetic fields as well as the plasma 
 content of each jet. In parallel to these advances in VLBI imaging\, modern
  computational resources now support the production and execution of increa
 singly sophisticated 3D numerical jet simulations\, from semi-analytic shoc
 k-in-jet and turbulence models\, to relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD
 ) and particle-in-cell (PIC) jet plasma simulations.\n\nMy research focuses
  on bridging the gap between these 3D relativistic jet simulations and mm-w
 ave global VLBI observations of blazar jets through the application of ray-
 tracing and polarized radiative transfer. In this talk\, I will present a s
 uite of relativistic jet simulations that attempt to place firmer constrain
 ts on the as yet unknown plasma content of black hole jets.</p>\n<p>Host: <

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>All-Sky Visible and Near Infrared Space Astrometry
 \, a Voyage 2050 proposal</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Our Galaxy contains many 
 different types of stars and planets\, interstellar gas and dust\, and dark
  matter. These components are widely distributed in age\, reflecting their 
 formation history\, and in space\, reflecting their birth place and subsequ
 ent motion. Objects in the Galaxy move in a variety of orbits that are dete
 rmined by the gravitational force\, and have complex distributions of diffe
 rent stellar types\, reflecting star formation and gas-accretion history. U
 nderstanding all these aspects in one coherent picture is being partially a
 chieved by Gaia\, which surveys around 1% of the Galaxy and is still ongoin
 g today. However much more could be done by using Near InfraRed light to pe
 er through the dust and gas to reveal the hidden regions of the Galaxy.\n\n
 A new all-sky Near InfraRed astrometric mission will expand and improve on 
 the science of Gaia using basic astrometry. Near InfraRed astrometry is cru
 cial for penetrating obscured regions and for observing intrinsically red o
 bjects. The new mission is aimed at surveying around 10-12 billion stars of
  the Galaxy\, revealing important new regions obscured by interstellar gas 
 and dust while also improving on the accuracy of the previous results from 
 Gaia. There is no single science case to point to\, instead the mission wil
 l explore the Galaxy\, particularly the hidden regions\, to reveal nature's
  true complexity and beauty in action.\n\nIn 2019 ESA announced the next pl
 anning cycle for their long term Science Programme\, called Voyage 2050. Th
 e program called for White Papers outlining new ideas for future space miss
 ion themes. In June 2021 Voyage 2050 finally set sail\, with ESA having cho
 sen its future science mission themes. Our proposal on All-Sky Visible and 
 Near Infrared Space Astrometry has been selected as one of two possible the
 mes for a future Large category mission for ESA or as a Medium class missio
 n with international partners. This talk will give an overview of the scien
 ce goals\, the mission design and its current status.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Neig

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Extrasolar Planets via Bayesian Model Fitting</b><
 /p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I will describe a Bayesian nonlinear model fitting prog
 ram based on a new hybrid Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) algorithm which
  incorporates parallel tempering\, simulated\nannealing and genetic crossov
 er operations. Each of these features facilitate the\ndetection of a global
  minimum in chi-squared. By combining all three\, the HMCMC greatly\nincrea
 ses the probability of realizing this goal. The algorithm also incorporates
  a new form of differential\nevolution to handle highly correlated paramete
 rs. When applied to the Kepler problem\nit acts as a powerful multi-planet 
 Kepler periodogram. Recently\, the algorithm has been used to resolve\nthe 
 issue of a disputed second planet in 47 Ursae Majoris and provide evidence 
 of a new third planet.\nThe talk will commence with an introduction to Baye
 sian analysis and MCMC.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Towards a high precision treatment of neutrino cos
 mology</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: We use the laboratory of the early universe 
 to constrain physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cos
 mology.  Our methods utilize codes to self-consistently follow neutrino spe
 ctra over many Hubble times.  We make predictions on how new physics will m
 odify the cosmological observables related to the neutrino sector. Specific
 ally\, we investigate changes in the neutrino energy density parameterized 
 by Neff\, the primordial nuclide abundances of helium and deuterium\, and t
 he baryon density.  We will focus on the epoch when the neutrinos decouple 
 from the thermal plasma and the numerical models of the weak\, strong\, and
  electromagnetic reactions between the constituents of the early universe.<

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Why the day is 24 hours long</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstrac
 t: Geologic data show that the number of days per month decreased over the 
 last 1\,300 Myr\, while the length of day increased. In contrast\, the numb
 er of days per month increased between 2\,800 Mya and 1\,300 Mya\, while th
 e length of day was roughly constant\, at approximately 19.5 hours. This is
  consistent with a balance between the gravitational Lunar tidal torque and
  the resonant solar thermal atmospheric torque. I will describe gravitation
 al and thermal tides\, giving order of magnitude or better analytical estim
 ates for the corresponding torques. I will show how to use the data to infe
 r the mean surface temperature T as a function of time\; a resonant atmosph
 eric period of 19.5 hours corresponds to T=50C. Similarly high temperatures
  are reached for plausible atmospheric pressures and compositions\, despite
  the lower Solar flux 1\,500 to 2\,500 Mya. Absent the thermal tide\, the c
 urrent length of day would be 65 hours.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Halometry from Astrometry</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: 
 Halometry - mapping out the spectrum\, location\, and kinematics of nonlumi
 nous structures inside the Galactic halo - can be realized via variable wea
 k gravitational lensing of the apparent motions of stars and other luminous
  background sources. Modern astrometric surveys provide unprecedented posit
 ional precision along with a leap in the number of cataloged objects. Astro
 metry thus offers a new and sensitive probe of collapsed dark matter struct
 ures over a wide mass range\, from one millionth to several million solar m
 asses. It opens up a window into the spectrum of primordial curvature fluct
 uations at scales hitherto poorly constrained. \n\nI will outline detection
  strategies based on three classes of observables - multi-blips\, templates
 \, and correlations - that take advantage of correlated effects in the moti
 on of many background light sources that are produced through time-domain g
 ravitational lensing. While existing techniques based on single-source obse
 rvables such as outliers and mono-blips are best suited for point-like lens
  targets\, our methods offer parametric improvements for extended lens targ
 ets such as dark matter subhalos. Multi-blip lensing events may also unveil
  the existence\, location\, and mass of planets in the outer reaches of the
  Solar System\, where they would likely have escaped detection by direct im
 aging. I will also show some preliminary results based on the Gaia DR2 data
  set.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Simon Foreman</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Efficient Methods for Structure Formation</b></p>\
 n\n<p>Abstract: First\, we investigate the use of a logarithmic density var
 iable in estimating the Lagrangian displacement field. The linear and logar
 ithmic density-displacement relations are compared by measuring both of the
 se fields directly in a cosmological /N/-body simulation. We find that the 
 relation between the divergence of the displacement field and the density i
 s significantly tighter with a logarithmic density variable\, especially at
  low redshifts and for very small (~2Mpc/h) smoothing scales\, and we find 
 that grid-based methods are more reliable than the tessellation-based metho
 d of calculating both the density and the divergence fields. We then presen
 t the ORIGAMI method of identifying structures\, particularly halos\, in co
 smological /N/-body simulations. Halo particles are identified as those tha
 t have undergone shell-crossing along 3 orthogonal axes\, providing a dynam
 ical definition of halo regions that is independent of density. ORIGAMI als
 o identifies other morphological structures: particles that have undergone 
 shell-crossing along 2\, 1\, or 0 orthogonal axes correspond to filaments\,
  walls\, and voids respectively. We compare this method to a standard Frien
 ds-of-Friends halo-finding algorithm and find that ORIGAMI halos are somewh
 at larger and more diffuse\, though the global properties of ORIGAMI halos 
 are in good agreement with other modern halo-finding algorithms. Finally\, 
 we briefly describe the currently-running Indra suite of cosmological simul
 ations and the possibilities enabled by large-scale simulations in a databa
 se.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Tony Chu</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Multiwavelength emission in the high energy univer
 se</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: High-energy astrophysical systems like black hol
 e accretion disks\, jets\, and coronae consist of magnetized\, (near)-colli
 sionless relativistic plasma. \nThey produce observable high-energy radiati
 on in the form of short\, intense flares. It is currently unclear where and
  how this emission is produced. \nThe radiation is typically non-thermal\, 
 implying a power-law distribution of emitting relativistic electrons. Magne
 tic reconnection is a viable mechanism \nto tap the large reservoir of magn
 etic energy in these systems and accelerate electrons to extreme energies. 
 The accelerated electrons can \nthen emit high-energy photons that themselv
 es may strongly interact with the plasma\, rendering a highly nonlinear sys
 tem. Modeling these systems \nnecessitates a combination of magnetohydrodyn
 amic models to capture the global dynamics of the formation of dissipation 
 regions\, and a kinetic treatment of \nplasma processes that are responsibl
 e for energy dissipation\, particle acceleration\, and radiation. I will pr
 esent novel studies of flaring and high-energy emission \nsignatures from r
 egions close to black hole event horizons\, using both first-principles gen

 cale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models. With this combination I
  determine whether (turbulent) magnetic reconnection is a \nviable dissipat
 ion mechanism\, where it occurs\, and what kind of emission signatures are 
 typically produced. In the end\, I will outline how my approach\nof global 
 magnetohydrodynamics and kinetic models will enable quantitative comparison
 s with observations of multiwavelength observations \nof radio\, X-ray\, an

 Radiation MHD Simulations</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In the standard thin disk
  model\, the inner region of the accretion disk is strongly radiation press
 ure dominated and electron scattering is usually thought to be the dominant
  opacity. This disk model is known to be thermally unstable and is inconsis
 tent with many observed properties of AGN disks. By performing a series of 
 3D global radiation MHD simulations\, I will show that the very inner regio
 n of the disk can end up being primarily supported by magnetic pressure. Th
 e formation of coronae in the photosphere of accretion disks is a natural o
 utcome of the accretion process with turbulence generated by magneto-rotati
 onal instability. Magnetic fields amplified in the main body of the disks r
 ise up buoyantly and dissipate in the optically thin region\, which generat
 es the coronae. Coronae properties and the amount of dissipation that can h
 appen there depend on the detailed structures of the accretion disks. For t
 he radial range 30 to 80 gravitational radii from the black hole\, the disk
  is radiation pressure dominated. However\, additional opacity bumps\, whic
 h can be much larger than the electron scattering opacity\, can exist in th
 e disk and change the thermal properties of the disk in this region. It can
  also cause large amplitude variabilities of the disk luminosity. I will di
 scuss implications of these simulations for understanding various puzzles o

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>A New Look at Nonlinear Evolution of Alfven Waves 
 in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Young and active neu
 tron stars may experience star quakes that can launch kHz Alfven waves into
  the magnetosphere. An Alfven wave packet propagating along the closed fiel
 d lines undergoes several interesting nonlinear processes: (1) the Alfven w
 ave can convert to fast magnetosonic waves that leave the magnetosphere\; (
 2) the Alfven wave packet gets sheared due to the different lengths of neig
 hboring field lines\, leading to enhanced current that triggers kinetic ins
 tabilities\; (3) Alfven waves propagating to the outer magnetosphere may br
 eak and form “plasmoids” (closed field loops) that accelerate away from the
  star. Most interestingly\, the third process may be a viable mechanism to 
 produce the simultaneous X-ray bursts and fast radio bursts from the galact
 ic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. In this talk\, I’ll present our systematic study
  of these processes and discuss their observational consequences.\n</p>\n<p

 b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In this seminar\, I will present two promising ways 
 in which the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sheds light on critical unce
 rtain physics and systematics of the large-scale structure.\n       Shear c
 alibration with CMB lensing (arXiv:1607.01761):\nRealizing the full potenti
 al of upcoming weak lensing surveys requires an exquisite understanding of 
 the errors in galaxy shape estimation. In particular\, such errors lead to 
 a multiplicative bias in the shear\, degenerate with the matter density par
 ameter and the amplitude of fluctuations. Its redshift-evolution can hide t
 he true evolution of the growth of structure\, which probes dark energy and
  possible modifications to general relativity. I will show that CMB lensing
  from a stage 4 experiment (CMB S4) can self-calibrate the shear for an LSS
 T-like optical lensing experiment. This holds in the presence of photo-z er
 rors and intrinsic alignment.\n       Evidence for the kinematic Sunyaev-Ze
 l'dovich (kSZ) effect (arXiv:1510.06442)\; cluster energetics:\nThrough the
  kSZ effect\, the baryon momentum field is imprinted on the CMB. I will rep
 ort significant evidence for the kSZ effect from ACTPol and peculiar veloci
 ties reconstructed from BOSS. I will present the prospects for constraining
  cluster gas profiles and energetics from the kSZ effect with SPT-3G\, AdvA
 CT and CMB S4. This will provide constraints for galaxy formation and feedb

 \n\n<p>Abstract: The aim of this talk is to discuss the physical processing
  of cosmic carbonaceous dust under extreme conditions. In the first part of
  the talk\, I will illustrate my research about Polycyclic Aromatic Hydroca
 rbons (PAHs). These molecules are an ubiquitous component of the Interstell
 ar Medium\, dominating the mid-infrared emission of many astronomical objec
 ts. However\, very little was known about the destiny of PAHs when they are
  bombarded by high-velocity ions and electrons arising from shocks\, hot ga
 s and cosmic rays. What happens to the PAH molecules under these extreme co
 nditions? Will they be able to survive\, maintaining their character\, or w
 ill they be severely damaged or even completely destroyed? And what are the
  astrophysical implications of such processing ?\nThe second part of the ta
 lk will focus on the specific case of the destruction of newly formed dust 
 grains by the reverse shock propagating into the supernova remnant Cassiope
 ia A. While theoretical models indicate supernovae as main dust factories\,
  the amount of fresh dust observed is still orders of magnitude lower than 
 the predicted quantity. I will show how the destruction by the reverse shoc
 k could help \nclarifying this still-open problem.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Quang L

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Constraining Fundamental Physics with present and 
 future CMB Experiments</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The recent measurements of t
 he Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotrop
 y from experiments such as WMAP\, ACBAR and many others have confirmed the 
 theoretical predictions of the standard cosmological model based on inflati
 on\, dark matter and a cosmological constant. This not only permits to plac
 e stringent constraints on several parameters of the model but also to use 
 it as a new laboratory where to test physical processes in an environment n
 ot achievable otherwise.\nIn particular\, there is a remarkable agreement b
 etween the theoretical description of the recombination process and the dat
 a. This fact enables to test any deviation from standard recombination with
  very high accuracy. Here I focus on the possible presence of an extra inje
 ction of energy due to the annihilation of dark matter particles. Interesti
 ng model-independent constraints on dark matter properties such as the anni
 hilation cross section and the dark matter particle mass can be determined 
 by using current CMB data.\nFurthermore\, the dependency of the recombinati
 on process on the strength of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces 
 enables to put constraints on the Variation of the fine structure constant 
 and Newton's gravitational constant.\nI will present the effect that these 
 phenomena imprint on the CMB and the constraints obtainable using WMAP data
  and other ground-based experiments. Furthermore\, I will show that upcomin
 g data from the Planck satellite and the ACT telescope will improve all the
  constraints by more than one order of magnitude.\n(arXiv:1005.3808v1\, arX

 Abstract: Model-independent parameterisations of modified gravity have attr
 acted a lot of attention over the past few years and numerous combinations 
 of experiments and observables have been suggested to constrain the paramet
 ers used in these models. Galaxy clusters have been mentioned\, but not loo
 ked at as extensively in the literature as some other probes. Here we look 
 at adding galaxy clusters into the mix of observables and examine how they 
 could improve the constraints on the modified gravity parameters. We find t
 hat cluster counts significantly improve the constraints obtained from comb
 ining Cosmic Microwave Background and weak lensing measurements. A key part
  of the forecast is the use of cluster mass functions\, which are prescript
 ions for predicting the expected number of clusters given the linear theory
  matter power spectrum. I will examine how robust these mass function predi
 ctions are in a modified gravity context\, using the results of a suite of

 n fraction is substantially lower\, maximizing at about 25%\, and is primar
 ily in the form of stars in the central galaxy. Stacking large numbers of g

 extended distribution than the dark matter\, a likely consequence of feedba
 ck effects. Gravitational lensing allows the scaling relations between gala

 monstrating that these relations depend on properties of the central galaxy
  other than just its mass.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marcelo Alvarez</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Star Formation By Demand</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: W
 hen averaged over large scales\, star formation rates (SFRs) are related to
  the gaseous content of disk galaxies by empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) l
 aws\, and are also correlated with stellar and dark matter content. Outer g
 alactic disks are primarily atomic and have steep KS laws. Mid-disks are do
 minated by molecular clouds and have nearly linear KS laws. Starburst regio
 ns (in ULIRGs and high-z galaxies) are molecule-dominated and have steep KS
  law.  Recent surveys have confirmed that the consumption of gas is highly 
 inefficient in all regimes: the gas depletion timescales far exceed both gl
 obal and local dynamical timescales. I will argue that the observed star fo
 rmation rate scalings -- and the low gas consumption efficiency -- are a co
 nsequence of ISM self-regulation mediated by energy feedback from massive s
 tars. In models we have recently developed\, SFRs evolve to meet the demand
 s of the local galactic environment.  In equilibrium\, ISM heating balances
  cooling\, total pressure balances gravity\, and turbulent driving balances
  dissipation. These simple models are in remarkably good agreement with obs
 ervations in all three regimes of star formation\, and have been confirmed 
 and calibrated using multiphase numerical hydrodynamic simulations. Because
  stars are so efficient at producing energy\, the ISM's demands can be met 
 with only slow depletion of a galaxy's gaseous fuel.\n\n</p>\n<p>Host: <b>J

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The early history of our solar system</b></p>\n\n<
 p>Abstract: Our understanding of the formation of the solar system has unde
 rgone a revolution in recent years\, owing to new discoveries and new theor
 etical insights.  The emerging picture is one of a dramatic orbital migrati
 on of the planets ~4 gigayears ago\, which produced the final solar system 
 architecture that we live in today.  The evidence is all over the solar sys
 tem\, as close as the Moon and as far away as Pluto and the Kuiper belt. I 
 will review this new view of our solar system's history\, describe recently
  identified evidence\, and critically assess current theoretical models.\n<

 which is based on a resolution of the  r=0 Schwarzschild singularity sugges
 ted by loop quantum gravity.  All quantum information trapped by the black 
 hole is eventually released from the white hole\, without any Cauchy horizo

 l Turok suggesting a rigid and predictive new approach to addressing them.\
 n\nOur universe seems to be dominated by radiation at early times\, and pos

  regarded as a kind of mirror.\n\nI will explain how this line of thought s
 uggests new explanations for a number of observed properties of the univers
 e\, including: its homogeneity\, isotropy and flatness\; the arrow of time 
 (i.e. the fact that entropy increases *away* from the bang)\; the nature of
  dark matter (which\, in this picture\, is a right-handed neutrino\, radiat
 ed from the early universe like Hawking radiation from a black hole)\; the 
 origin of the primordial perturbations\; and even the existence of three ge
 nerations of standard model fermions. I will discuss some observational pre

 re genetic traits which are set\, in a large part\, by the `DNA' defined by
  density fluctuations in the early universe\, which govern the eventual mas
 s assembly of galaxies. Large scale surveys in the Milky Way such as Gaia\,
  APOGEE and GALAH\, among others\, have revealed new and intriguing `traits
 ' of the Milky Way. One such example is the clear bi-modality in alpha-elem
 ent abundances relative to Iron at fixed Iron abundance\, which exhibits it
 self throughout the disc of the Galaxy. Many recent works have focused on u
 nderstanding and characterising this feature\, and have shown that it is li
 kely one of the most important features of the Milky Way to be understood\,
  if we are to fully characterise its formation and evolution. Here\, I will
  propose that the [α/Fe] bimodality in the Milky Way may be directly connec
 ted to its history of mass assembly. I will demonstrate\, using 'geneticall
 y modified' zoom-in cosmological simulations which vary the assembly histor
 y of a Milky Way-like galaxy whilst holding all other conditions fixed\, th
 at this is a good predictor of a galaxy's stellar population structure in t
 he [α/Fe] plane. This has far-reaching implications for understanding the M
 ilky Way and the physics that lead to its formation\, but also provides a c
 ompelling motivation to search for and characterise this feature in the ext
 ernal galaxy population.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Janosz Dewberry</b></p>

 t their subsequent evolution to a BH merger and gravitational-wave recoil k

  BH motion on kiloparsec scales\, we have made a\nfirst attempt to model th
 e NL region in galaxy merger simulations. In general\, we find that double-

  of our large study of recoiling SMBHs in galaxy merger simulations. I will
  describe the dynamics of recoil in gas-rich versus gas-poor mergers\, as w

 er</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: On August 17 the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave o
 bservatories detected the first binary neutron star merger event (GW170817)
 \, a discovery followed by the most ambitious electromagnetic (EM) follow-u
 p campaign ever conducted.  Within 2 seconds of the merger\, a weak burst o
 f gamma-rays was discovered by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites.  Within 1
 1 hours\, a bright but rapidly-fading thermal optical counterpart was disco
 vered in the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of only 130 Million light years.
   The properties of the optical transient match remarkably well predictions
  for “kilonova” emission powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei s
 ynthesized in the expanding merger ejecta by rapid neutron capture nucleosy
 nthesis (r-process).  The rapid spectral evolution of the kilonova emission
  to near-infrared wavelengths demonstrates that a portion of the ejecta con
 tains heavy lanthanide nuclei.  Two weeks after the merger\, rising non-the
 rmal X-ray and radio emission were detected from the position of the optica
 l transient\, consistent with delayed synchrotron afterglow radiation from 
 an initially off-axis relativistic jet (or a shock-heated "cocoon" produced
  as the jet interacts with the kilonova ejecta).  I will describe efforts t
 o create a unified scenario for the range of EM counterparts from GW170817 
 and their implications for the astrophysical origin of the r-process and th
 e properties of neutron stars (particularly their uncertain radii and maxim
 um mass\, which are determined by the equation of state of dense nuclear ma
 tter).  Time permitting\, I will preview the upcoming era of multi-messenge
 r astronomy\, once Advanced LIGO/Virgo reach design sensitivity and a neutr
 on star merger is detected every few weeks.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Aaron Zimmerma

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Magnetically Controlled Accretion Flows and Winds 
 from Planets</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: This talk considers two related proble
 ms involving magnetically controlled flows in young stellar objects and in 
 exoplanets. First we revisit the problem of magnetically controlled accreti
 on onto young and forming stars (with a focus on analytic results).  The ac
 cretion flow depends on the field geometry\, and we generalize previous wor
 k to include magnetic fields with multiple components\, including dipole\, 
 octupole\, and split monopole contributions. Observations indicate that acc
 reting young stars have substantial dipole and octupole components\, and th
 at accretion flow is transonic.  The inclusion of octupole field components
  produces higher densities at the stellar surface and smaller hot spots\, w
 hich occur at higher latitudes\; the magnetic truncation radius is smaller 
 (larger) for octupole components that are aligned (anti-aligned) with the s
 tellar dipole. Next we consider the effects of magnetic fields on exoplanet
  outflows\, which have now been observed. For typical parameters\, the magn
 etic field pressure near the planetary surface dominates the ram pressure o
 f the outflow by several orders of magnitude. Magnetically controlled outfl
 ows differ significantly from previous spherical models: The outflow rates 
 are somewhat smaller\, and the flow is launched primarily from the polar re
 gions of the planet.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>James Owen</b></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Two Tales of the Early Universe</b></p>\n\n<p>Abst
 ract: Our newly-sharp picture of cosmological evolution has shown our prese
 nt description of physics is incomplete. Dark matter\, dark energy\, baryog
 enesis\, and the origin of the Universe require new ideas at the frontier o
 f physics. I discuss two ideas from this early-universe frontier.  I first 
 describe a new theory\, hylogenesis\, of the simultaneous formation of dark
  matter and baryon number in the early Universe.  Remarkably\, this model p
 redicts a spectacular new channel\, induced nucleon decay\, for in the dire
 ct detection of dark matter.  Dark matter scattering from ordinary matter m
 ay convert baryons into mesons and be observed in nucleon-decay search expe
 riments.  Changing gears\, I then discuss new imprints of the origin of the
  Universe in the CMB. If our observable Universe originated from a bubble-n
 ucleation event in a parent false vacuum it may have collided with another 
 bubble-universe.  Such a collision induces an unusually symmetric perturbat
 ion\, a cosmic wake\, which affects our Hubble volume and imprints distinct
 ive and potentially observable temperature and polarization signals in the 
 CMB.  I'll discuss the first calculation of cosmic wake evolution\, and pro
 spects for detecting them with Planck or other CMB missions.\n</p>\n<p>Host

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Flaring Activity of the Black Hole at the Center o
 f the Galaxy</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: It is clear that an under-luminous sup
 ermassive black hole (Sgr A*) with a mass of 4.2 million solar mass lies at
  the center of the Galaxy. Precise measurements taken at radio and infrared
  wavelengths over the last two decades have led to this conclusion.  The re
 cent studies indicate deviations from Keplerian motion of a star orbiting t
 he black hole\, the precession of an orbiting star\, and an image of the sh
 adow of the black hole. These measurements are consistent with the predicti
 ons of the Einstein's general theory of relativity. I will present highligh
 ts of recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations to study the fl
 aring activity of the black hole. The variability of the black hole probes 
 the process of the accretion flow at a distance of few Schwarszchild radius
  before running across the event horizon.  These observations indicate that
  the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly punctuated with multiple sync
 hrotron flares per day.  I will argue that two distinct populations of part
 icles produce bright and faint synchrotron variable emission.  As for the o
 rigin of the infrared flares\, a number of recent simulations suggest that 
 flares are ejected plasmoids from the accretion disk due to the reconnectio
 n of the magnetic field lines. Time permitting\, I will also discuss the re
 lationship between radio/submm\, X-ray and infrared variable emission.</p>\

 stract: We are now approaching a century of supernova discovery\, yet the d

 emains a central open question in astrophysics. Supernova remnants (SNRs) p

 NRs and microquasars\, providing clues to the origin of high-energy cosmic 
 rays and to the physics of particle acceleration up to PeV energies. Core-c

 from “traditional” rotation-powered pulsars like the Crab to magnetars and

 regulator of star formation in giant molecular clouds (GMCs) where all star
  formation is observed to occur. Through their powerful radiation fields\, 
 these stars act to disperse the clouds that made them in multiple. Two of t
 he most powerful mechanisms are bubbles blown by the the shocked gas create

 by the stars' hard ionizing spectra. In this talk I will review how these t

 Milky-Way like GMCs and dense\, low-metallicity environments as may be pres

 be used for inference based on observations of star-formation in the nearby

 rge and complex datasets beyond traditional methods. In studies of star for
 mation and the interstellar medium\, AI provides tools to extract physical 
 insights and link simulations with observations. First\, I will show how di
 scriminative AI can identify and quantify stellar feedback and protostellar
  outflows\, using 3D models trained on synthetic data to recover both struc
 tural and statistical properties. Second\, I will discuss how generative AI
  can infer the intrinsic physical conditions of molecular clouds\, such as 
 gas density\, magnetic fields\, and radiation fields\, from sparse observat

 cluding Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the Diffusion S
 chrödinger Bridge (DSB)\, which provide physics-aware and interpretable inf
 erence while remaining robust to out-of-distribution data. Together\, these
  studies demonstrate the promise of integrating discriminative and generati

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Unveiling the Physics of Galaxy Formation and Its 
 Large-scale Effects at Cosmic Dawn</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Cosmic dawn\, lo
 osely defined here to be the first billion years of cosmic time\, is an int
 riguing era that witnessed the formation of the first generations of galaxi
 es. Towards the end of it there was the last major phase transition of our 
 Universe\, the epoch of reionization (EoR)\, which is believed to be driven
  by the hydrogen-ionizing radiation background emerged from the early galax
 ies formed. In this talk\, I will explain how cosmic dawn becomes a real ex
 citing epoch for unveiling the physics of galaxy formation thanks to the Ja
 mes Webb Space Telescope (JWST)\, as well as several forthcoming facilities
  such as SPHEREx\, Roman Space Telescope\, and Square Kilometer Array\, tha
 t will probe the large-scale effects of early galaxy formation. I will disc
 uss the theoretical landscape of galaxy formation at cosmic dawn informed b

 ty star formation. I will introduce methods and ideas to shed light on diff
 erent aspects of early galaxy formation\, including the star formation hist
 ory\, stellar feedback\, outflows\, and the ionizing output\, using both in
 dividual galaxies and their effects on the large-scale structure as probes.
  With a few case studies\, I will demonstrate how to harness the power of t
 he aforementioned facilities (and their synergies) for unveiling the physic
 al nature of galaxies at cosmic dawn.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Current sheets and the plasmoid instability: media
 tors of fast magnetic reconnection and turbulence</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: C
 urrent sheets are localized regions of the plasma in which the current dens
 ity can become singular in the zero-dissipation limit. While the critical r
 ole of such structures in mediating fast reconnection and turbulence has be
 en recognized for some time\, the universal nature of the plasmoid instabil
 ity of these structures in high-Lundquist-number plasmas and its role has b
 ecome a subject of significant interest relatively recently. Enabled by sop
 histicated computer simulations and analytical theory and tested by experim
 ents\, the plasmoid instability has transformed our understanding of magnet
 ic reconnection and inspired new research in space\, astrophysical\, and la
 boratory (including fusion and high-energy-density) plasmas. In this talk\,
  I will review the evolution of our understanding in systems where closed f
 ield lines exist (such as in a torus) and those where they may not (such as
  in stellar coronae and compact astrophysical objects where field lines may
  be line-tied). Even the definition of magnetic reconnection in the latter 
 class of systems remains a contested issue. In turbulent systems characteri
 zed by the formation of thin current sheets\, the onset of the plasmoid ins
 tability is shown to interrupt the inertial range and introduce new power l
 aws for the dissipation range and produce coherent structures that play an 
 essential role in particle acceleration and heating in non-relativistic as 
 well as relativistic regimes. Exascale computers\, exploited by state-of-th
 e-art codes\, hold the promise of breaking new ground in making predictions
  in plasma regimes that have been hitherto inaccessible. Despite the progre
 ss made in theory and experiment\, many open questions remain. Some of them
  will be discussed.</p>\n

 Abstract: The CGM is thought to play an important role in mediating galaxy 
 evolution and star formation\; however\, despite containing a significant f
 raction of the universe's baryons\, the physical state of the CGM remains  
 relatively unconstrained. The ubiquitous observations of cool (T~10^4K) gas
  out to large radii complicate simple pictures of gas accretion and seem to
  point to the presence of structure in the gas down to small scales (subpar
 sec) difficult to resolve in simulation. FRB scattering studies stand to sh
 ed light on the morphology of this cool gas on very small scales. But a pro
 blem has arisen: despite now thousands of FRBs detected\, there has been no
  positive detection of any scattering of these sources outside of the Milky
  Way ISM or the host environment. What does this surprising absence of scat
 tering from intervening CGM tell us about the nature of the cool gas? How c
 an we detect scattering in the CGM or otherwise use FRBs as a probe of this
  mysterious medium?</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Nate</b></p>

  other interactions are mitigated\, e.g. electromagnetic (EM) interactions 
 between the masses. It proves the quantum nature of gravity\, as classical 
 gravity cannot mediate quantum correlations (entanglement). The potentially
  realisable protocol requires meeting a rich set of challenges: mitigating 
 the EM interactions and background\, creating spatial quantum superposition

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>New observations of heavy elements in old metal-po
 or stars</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Immense progress followed the detection of
  the blue kilonova (AT2017gfo) in 2017. However\, a large number of open qu
 estions related to the nature and detailed physics of the r-process remain.
  Exactly how and where does the r-process form the heavy (Z>30) elements? N
 umerous stellar observations and various Galactic chemical evolution models
  indicate a need for more r-processes or sites - or show that the r-process
  is not as universal and robust as earlier believed. This picture is presen
 t both in the more metal-rich\, younger disk as well as in the Milky Way's 
 old halo. Observations of old\, metal-poor stars show a large abundance spr
 ead in the heavy elements. This spread indicates that different processes c
 ould take place and contribute different amounts of the heavy elements in e
 ach explosion event. Here\, observations of poorly studied heavy elements l
 ike Hf\, Os\, Ir and Pt recently provided new insight into the physics and 
 nature of the r-process.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Gustavo Medina Toledo</b></p>

 he icy grain mantels. These hot\, dense regions of molecular gas bear the k

  the capacity to access the inner ~1–10 au of disks around both low- and hi
 gh-mass protostars\, including the planet-forming zone in protoplanetary di
 sks. While high mass protostars will not form planets themselves\, they are
  the most powerful probes of the molecular chemistry in star forming region
 s.\n\nI will present results from MIR molecular spectroscopy of massive sta
 r forming regions taken with the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Ast
 ronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA was a Boeing 747 modified to accommodate a telescope 
 and flew at 45\,000 ft\, above most of Earth's infrared-blocking atmosphere
 . With the EXES instrument aboard SOFIA we completed the first high resolut
 ion MIR survey towards the enigmatic source Orion IRc2 within our closest m
 assive star forming region. Towards the massive binary protostellar system 
 NGC 7538 IRS 1\, we discovered methanol for the first time in the MIR\, a k

  phenomena often occurs in the radiative regime in the relativistic limit\,
  relevant to emission observed from astrophysical objects such as black hol

 rs.  For black hole coronae in particular\, relativistic radiative reconnec

 d: insights from multi-tracer large-scale structure simulations</b></p>\n\n
 <p>Abstract: Mapping the emission of atomic and molecular lines at high red
 shifts is a promising method to probe the large-scale structure of the Univ
 erse in regimes which are challenging to conventional galaxy surveys. Howev
 er\, understanding how the aggregate signal from a line-intensity mapping (
 LIM) survey relates to the underlying dark matter distribution is a difficu
 lt problem. The landscape of LIM surveys is also inherently multi-tracer\, 
 with many current and upcoming experiments overlapping significantly with o
 ptical photometric and spectroscopic galaxy surveys\, as well as observatio
 ns of the cosmic microwave background across multiple frequency bands. In t
 his talk I will introduce a method to use empirical galaxy formation models
 \, coupled to cosmological N-body simulations\, to generate multi-tracer ma
 ps of emission across multiple lines and redshifts\, including  21 cm\, CO\
 , CII\, and Lyman-α. I will showcase their mutual cross-correlations\, and 
 cross-correlations with galaxy clustering. By applying this method to the A
 gora simulation for the multi-component sky\, we can also cross-correlate L
 IM observables with those extracted from sub-millimeter surveys such as the
  cosmic infrared background and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. As a case stu
 dy\, I will focus on a quantification of the amplitude of CO as an extragal
 actic foreground in the frequency bands of ground-based CMB experiments\, s
 howing that a CO component is potentially detectable with current-generatio
 n telescopes. Time permitting\, I will also comment on recent work using th
 ese simulations to produce templates for a non-Gaussian summary statistic b
 etween CHIME-like HI maps and CMB lensing.</p>\n

 some stage during the star-formation process. However\, computational chall
 enges have hindered a comprehensive exploration of the effects of ambipolar
  diffusion in three dimensions. In this talk\, I will present results from 
 3-dimensional non-ideal MHD chemo-dynamical simulations of turbulent collap
 sing molecular clouds where the resistivities are self-consistently calcula
 ted from a non-equilibrium chemical network consisting of 115 species\, and
  with a different mean collisional rate used for each charged species in th

 "\, the features of the neutral-ion drift velocity become increasingly comp
 lex in the presence of turbulence\, with many vectors even pointing outward
  from the cloud's center. I will discuss the implications of this behavior 
 for the spatial and temporal evolution of the true (i.e. differential) mass
 -to-flux ratio. To assess observational biases in measuring the neutral-ion
  drift\, I have also conducted a number of non-LTE line radiative-transfer 
 experiments and developed a roadmap to observationally constraint it. Final

 arine in their depths\, geophysical sounding offers a way to bound the like
 ly thickness and composition of such oceans. NASA’s prior Galileo and Cassi
 ni missions demonstrated the application of radar\, gravity\, and magnetic 
 measurements for these purposes. Innovations in geochemistry\, and robust c
 omputational methods\, make it possible to also constrain the composition o
 f oceans using geophysical methods. Combined with direct measurements of ne
 ar-surface material compositions by spectroscopic imaging and mass spectrom
 etry\, it will be possible test hypotheses about the pH of existing oceans\
 , their global circulation\, and the likely degree of chemical disequilibri
 um that might support life. Indeed\, the goal of NASA’s Europa Clipper miss
 ion is to “Explore Jupiter’s moon Europa to investigate it’s habitability”.
  I will describe the overall context of ocean worlds with a focus on Europa

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Where are the supermassive black holes measured by
  PTAs</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) consist of a set 
 of regularly monitored millisecond pulsars with extremely stable rotational
  periods. The arrival time of pulses can be altered by the passage of gravi
 tational waves (GWs) between them and the Earth\, thus serving as a galaxy-
 wide GW detector. Evidence for the first detection of low-frequency (~nHz) 
 gravitational waves has recently been reported across multiple PTA collabor
 ations\, opening a new observational window into the Universe. Although the
  origin of the GW signal is yet to be determined\, the dominant sources are
  expected to be inspiralling supermassive black holes. I will discuss what 
 we are learning from mapping the nano-hertz GW sky\, focusing on a recent w
 ork in which we compare the GW detections by PTAs with the expected signal 
 implied by existing electromagnetic observations in a simple but robust man
 ner. We highlight that there is a simple upper limit to the GWB amplitude a
 nd that the currently measured GW amplitude is somewhat larger than expecte
 d. I will then show that additional information regarding the typical numbe
 r of sources contributing to the background can already be inferred from cu

 iverse is an established method for getting a closer look at intriguing phy
 sics.  However\, determining when a local analogue functions well to repres
 ent distant systems\, and what limitations need to be kept in mind\, can be
  challenging.  Furthermore\, low redshift examples often reveal complexity 
 that gets hidden when looking at high redshift objects - often because of t
 he limits of spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity\, and mismatch
 es in bandpasses.  I'll discuss specific examples of local analogues - loca
 l compact galaxy groups and super Eddington-accreting AGN - that reveal com
 plexity that should be considered when studying distant objects.</p>\n<p>Ho

 Stars and Black Holes\, remains at the forefront of astronomical theory and

 pulation of stellar remnants. I will discuss how to use theoretical insight

 erstanding of compact object properties can inform our understanding of a b
 road range of astrophysical phenomena. I will discuss the current state of 
 the field\, with a focus on insights enabled by the technology I've develop

 ophysical Plasmas: A Versatile Kinetic PIC Framework</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract
 : Kinetic modeling offers a unique capability to resolve plasma processes t
 hat are inherently inaccessible to fluid or hybrid descriptions. This is pa
 rticularly critical for cold plasma populations\, whose low energies and no
 n-Maxwellian features are often poorly sampled or entirely missed by in sit
 u spacecraft measurements. In this talk\, I present the development and app
 lications of a Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code that has demonstrated broad vers
 atility across a wide range of plasma environments. Originally developed to
  study solar wind magnetosphere interactions\, the code has since evolved i
 nto a flexible kinetic framework capable of capturing diverse plasma regime
 s. It has been successfully applied to simulations of magnetosphere ionosph
 ere coupling\, plasma-sheet interactions with the lunar surface\, plasma in
 teractions with Jovian and Saturnian moons\, and stellar-wind interactions 
 with close-in exoplanets embedded within their host stars coronae. These ap
 plications naturally intersect with several research directions pursued at 
 the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA)\, particularly i
 n multi-scale plasma dynamics\, star planet interactions\, and the kinetic 
 foundations of astrophysical environments. The model employs macro-particle
 s representing large ensembles of ions and electrons\, while retaining a fu
 lly kinetic\, electromagnetic formulation. This general framework enables s
 calable applications beyond planetary systems\, offering a pathway toward m
 odeling larger astrophysical plasmas\, including star planet coupling and\,
  in principle\, galactic-scale environments. I will highlight key physical 
 insights enabled by this approach and discuss its relevance for future mult
 i-scale plasma investigations.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Maya Fishbach</b></p>

 n\nOne of the most surprising results from JWST has been the discovery of a

 optical colors\, blue UV slopes\, and broad Balmer lines. The compact sizes
  and luminous broad lines strongly suggest these objects are powered by acc

 egardless\, their high number densities (~5% of the galaxy population) make

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>On the Hunt for Recoiling Supermassive Black Holes
  Using Tidal Disruption Events</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Following the merger
  of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\, a gravitational wave recoil kick
  is imparted on the merger remnant due to the anisotropic emission of gravi
 tational waves. These recoil kicks can be as high as ~10^3 km/s which excee
 ds the escape velocity of most galaxies\, and these super-kicks can lead to
  ejected or rogue SMBHs. While there are several candidates\, recoiling SMB
 Hs are difficult to uniquely identify since observations so far cannot rule
  out alternate possibilities such as dual active galactic nuclei. Here\, we
  present a novel observational signature: off-nuclear or extragalactic tida
 l disruption events of stars by recoiling SMBHs. When a super-kick is impar
 ted on a SMBH\, there is a tightly bound cluster of stars recoiling with it
 . We show that these bound stars should be in an eccentric\, apse-aligned d
 isk where stars are strongly torqued to extremely high eccentricities. The 
 corresponding rate of tidal disruption events in an eccentric disk is expec
 ted to be of order ~0.1 yr^-1 gal^-1\, several orders of magnitude higher t
 han in an isotropic cluster. We show that this high expected rate of tidal 
 disruption events in an eccentric disk implies off-nuclear or extragalactic
  tidal disruption events as viable and likely observables of a recoiling or
  rogue SMBH. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Claire She Ye</b></p>

  the importance of global analysis of instrumental\, astrophysical and cosm

  datasets. These lessons has been further developed into a coherent pipelin
 e for global analysis of multiple datasets by BeyondPlanck and Cosmoglobe\,

 equires a drastically altered thermal dust model\, as well as adding models
  for starlight\, CII line emission and dynamical Zodiacal light emission. T

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Comparing the collision and merger products of sta
 rs using MHD</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: In dense star cluster cores\, frequent
  gravitational encounters often lead to stellar collisions. Additionally\, 
 close binaries in these dense environments can harden over time\, eventuall
 y undergoing mass transfer and merging due to orbit shrinkage. Using the mo
 ving-mesh magnetohydrodynamics code \\texttt{AREPO}\, we conduct the first 
 simulations comparing collisions and mergers of massive (5 - 10 Msun) main-
 sequence stars to examine similarities and differences in the properties of
  their resulting products. Our simulations show that both collisions and me
 rgers lead to significant internal mixing\, replenishing the stellar core w
 ith hydrogen from the envelope\, and extending the main-sequence lifetime. 
 This mixing also amplifies the stellar magnetic field by up to 10 orders of
  magnitude. The resulting stars rotate rapidly and differentially as a resu
 lt of angular momentum transfer from the orbits. Key differences emerge bet
 ween the two channels: merger products have noticeable axial outflows and d
 evelop more distinct disk-like structures in the merger plane compared to c
 ollision products. In addition\, collision products are mixed more thorough
 ly\, while merger products are more segregated.</p>\n

 Abstract: Isolated neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields (magnetar
 s) show spectacular X-ray activity. Recent observations of fast radio burst
 s (FRBs) offer a new window to magnetar activity with surprising physical p
 rocesses. The FRB puzzle has greatly stimulated the theoretical study of ma
 gnetospheres of neutron stars\, leading to new models of plasma dynamics in
  the ultrastrong magnetic fields. Currently explored phenomena include stro
 ng waves\, monster shocks\, and propagation (or absorption) of FRBs in the 
 ambient plasma. I will argue that FRBs are emitted by powerful ultrarelativ
 istic explosions from magnetars and similar explosions can accompany merger
 s of neutron stars and black holes. Observed repeaters suggest remarkably f
 requent explosive activity of magnetars in distant galaxies\, which may be 
 explained by their youth. FRB observations have also stimulated work on mag
 netic evolution of neutron star interior\, which suggests new forms of magn
 etar activity.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Nuclear reactions induced by pre-breakout shock pa
 ssage in BNS merger ejecta</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The first electromagneti
 c signal emitted form different types of stellar explosions (SNe\, GRBs\, B
 NS mergers)\, is released during the breakout of a shock created in the exp
 losion from the envelope surrounding the source.   A notable example is the
  faint gamma-ray flash  (GRB 170817A) that followed the gravitational wave 
 signal\, GW170817\, released during a BNS merger.  This flash has been inte
 rpreted as shock breakout emission\, most likely driven by a relativistic j
 et launched from the compact remnant.  We recently discovered that the pass
 age of such a fast shock in the dense r-process ejecta can induce nuclear t
 ransmutations that might change the composition behind the shock\, potentia
 lly affecting the very early kilonova emission.  After a brief introduction
  to shock breakout and the properties of radiation mediated shocks\, I’ll i
 ntroduce a multi-ion shock model constructed recently to account for the co
 nditions anticipated in such environments\,  and explain why and when nucle
 ar reactions are expected to be ignited  in the post shock plasma.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>The First Stars: Formation\, Properties\, and Impa

 ulation III (or Pop III)\, form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts
  z ~ 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star formation history until z 
 ~ 20-15\, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Pop II stars takes
  over. I review current theoretical models for the formation\, properties a
 nd impact of Pop III stars\, and discuss observational constraints. I argue
  that primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III sta
 rs form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass funct
 ion. Feedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating
  subsequent star formation\, but major uncertainties remain regarding its i
 mmediate impact. Direct observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe
  remain extremely challenging\, whereas stellar archeological surveys allow
  us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III ma

 heir lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supe
 rnovae.  I also speculate about the formation of supermassive stars\, which
  under very specific circumstances can get as massive as several 100.000 so
 lar masses and can become the seeds of the supermassive black holes observe
 d in the high-redshift universe.</p>\n

 and dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmol
 ogy. In addition to these theoretical challenges\, recent cosmological obse
 rvations have revealed potential signs of new physics beyond the standard Λ
 CDM paradigm. In this talk\, I will begin by briefly reviewing current cosm

 nergy\, the Hubble tension\, and the S8 tension. I will then explore possib

 actions between dark matter and dark energy. I will demonstrate that a simp
 le coupling between the two components can simultaneously address two disti
 nct anomalies: the DESI-indicated dynamical dark energy and the S8 tension.
  We propose a stable and technically natural particle physics realization o
 f this idea\, which exhibits an apparent phantom crossing behavior in the d
 ark energy equation of state\, consistent with DESI findings. The possible 
 resolutions to the Hubble tension will also be discussed.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>So long Kolmogorov: the direct and inverse cascade
 s for supernova-driven turbulence in the multiphase interstellar medium</b>
 </p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Supernova (SNe) detonations alone provide sufficient e
 nergy to power the interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence in our Galaxy. At a
  conceptual level\, SNe-driven turbulence is very different from the regula
 r Kolmogorov (1941) model of turbulence\, which is incompressible\, isotrop
 ic\, homogenous\, local and has a signed energy flux that moves energy from
  large to small scales (Kolmogorov’s 4/5ths law). Yet the ISM turbulence co
 mmunity continues to think of the ISM as being described by Kolmogorov-like
  phenomenology. In this talk I derive the three-mode energy flux transfers 
 functions\, allowing me to directly measure the sign and nature of the ener
 gy flux at a k mode level. I apply these to SNe-driven turbulence simulatio
 ns in a multiphase\, stratified ISM and reveal that the SNe-driven turbulen
 ce has almost no resemblance to Kolmogorov at all\, with strong nonlocal tr
 ansfers and inverse cascades in the incompressible modes\, specially where 
 the incompressible energy spectrum admits to a power law. Time-permitting\,
  I will also show that in a medium driven by compressible modes sourced by 
 SNe\, the incompressible modes are completely generated within fractal cool
 ing layers between the warm and hot plasma generated by the adiabatic expan
 sion the supernova remnants\, making phase mixing the primary source of inc
 ompressible mode turbulence in the ISM.</p>\n<p>Host: <b>Rimpei</b></p>

 id these elements come to exist? This question lies at the heart of my talk
 \, which will focus on two nucleosynthesis sites—binary neutron star merger
 s and black hole–neutron star mergers—and the ‘kilonova’ transients they pr
 oduce. In 2017\, the landmark detection of the kilonova AT2017gfo confirmed
  that neutron star mergers are a site of heavy element production. But impo
 rtant questions remain with respect to the details of nucleosynthesis in me
 rger ejecta\, the nature and diversity of kilonovae\, and whether such merg
 ers are the only source of heavy elements in the Universe. In this talk\, I
  will present our latest end-to-end kilonova models based on general-relati
 vistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants. We include essen
 tial neutrino physics that sets the electron fraction of the ejecta and\, i
 n turn\, the heavy element abundances. I will show that detailed numerical 
 modeling is necessary for linking kilonovae to their progenitors\, interpre
 ting past and future observations of these transients\, and gaining insight
  into the origin of heavy elements.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>From Nearby Dust to Distant Dawn: A tale of star c
 lusters in evolving galaxies</b></p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Minding the pressing h
 oliday schedule\, I will SHORTLY present recent results based on JWST obser
 vations of near and far galaxies. In local galaxies\, JWST is peering throu
 gh the dust revealing the hidden populations of emerging star clusters (eYS
 Cs) caught in the act of rapidly destroying their natal giant molecular clo
 uds (GMC). We find that the 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PA
 H) bands is a sensitive tracer of the earliest phases and rapidly disappear
 s within 4 Myr at the location of the eYSCs. I will present strong evidence
  of variations in the emergence timescale with most massive clusters emergi
 ng on average twice as fast as the low mass ones. These results have fundam
 ental implications for simulations of star formation\, the ability to enabl
 e the escape of ionizing radiation\, timescales available for planet format
 ion.  In the second part of my talk I will switch gear moving into what we 
 are learning of clustered star formation in high redshift galaxies. Thanks 
 to gravitational lensing we are able to analyze star formation down to 10s 
 of parsec scales. We find evidence that dense clumps/star clusters form out
  from disk fragmentation. Focusing on the most magnified galaxies\, I will 
 present an overview of the physical properties of the largest homogeneously
  analyzed star cluster sample (about 220 candidates) collected between reds
 hift 2 and 10. All the systems are gravitationally bounds: they will likely
  survive for a significant amount of time within their host system. Their f
 ormation redshift peaks around cosmic noon but we observe star clusters for
 ming as early as redshift 12. These systems are very dense and dominate the
  luminosity and mass of their host galaxies making them incredible furnaces
  for the formation of very massive stars and intermediate mass stellar blac
 k holes via runaway stellar collisions. </p>\n<p>Host: <b>Marta Reina-Campo

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: <b>Mapping the Local Dark Matter Distribution through

 r remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in modern astrophysics
  and cosmology. While Lambda-CDM provides excellent agreement with observat
 ions on cosmological scales\, significant tensions emerge at galactic and s
 ub-galactic scales\, where predictions from different dark matter models yi
 eld distinct observable signatures. Dwarf galaxies and stellar streams in t
 he Milky Way environment retain subtle signatures of dark matter physics in

 constraining dark matter properties. However\, inferring dark matter halo p

  models. In this talk\, I present how modern machine learning methods\, spe
 cifically neural simulation-based inference\, can provide a complementary a
 pproach to traditional techniques\, enabling robust constraints on dark mat
 ter halo parameters while naturally incorporating these observational compl
 exities. I demonstrate applications to both dwarf galaxies and stellar stre
 ams\, highlighting how this framework yields precise characterization of da

 th cosmic star-formation rate density and quasar number density reached the
 ir peak values. As a result\, this epoch---commonly known as "Cosmic Noon"-
 --represents a key phase in galaxy evolution and has been studied extensive
 ly over the last decade. In recent years\, our ability to characterize gala
 xies at these redshifts has improved dramatically thanks to the capabilitie

 ines sensitive to a variety of physical properties\, including gas temperat
 ure and hard ionizing radiation. I will review recent results from CECILIA\
 , a Cycle 1 JWST program that obtained ultra-deep (30-hour) spectra of typi
