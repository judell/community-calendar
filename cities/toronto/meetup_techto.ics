 /luma.com/together-toronto-mar-2-2026\n\n**​Together Toronto brings the 
 city’s tech community together for an evening of connection\, inspiratio
 n\, and learning**\n\n​Together Toronto is where the city’s most passi
 onate tech builders\, thinkers\, and doers come together to learn from the
  journeys that rarely get shared. At this signature event\, we spotlight r
 eal stories from founders who’ve navigated the ups\, downs\, and in-betw
 eens of building in Toronto’s fast-moving tech scene. These aren’t pol
 ished pitches or surface-level panels\, they’re honest\, behind-the-scen
 es conversations that reveal what it actually takes to launch\, scale\, an
 d grow a company.\n\n​You’ll hear from entrepreneurs who’ve taken bo
 ld bets\, faced unexpected challenges\, and found creative ways to move fo
 rward. Their stories offer more than inspiration - they deliver lessons\, 
 frameworks\, and insights that can change how you approach your own work. 
 Whether you're starting your first venture\, scaling a team\, or simply cu
 rious about how Canadian leading companies are built\, this event is for y
 ou.\n\nThis event is about more than just listening\, it’s about connect
 ing. You’ll be in a room full of founders\, investors\, operators\, and 
 future collaborators who believe in the power of community. It’s a chanc
 e to meet the people building what's next\, share ideas\, and be part of s
 omething bigger than yourself.
