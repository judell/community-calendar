SUMMARY:The Wellness OS: Getting to the Root
DESCRIPTION:Toronto Postgres\nJoin us for a (free!) five part interactive 
 workshop series for people in tech. These sessions are hands-on\, with exe
 rcises and education designed to build out the infrastructure of your well
 ness so you can optimize your life\, one bug fix at a time.\n\nMaintaining
  a career in tech often feels like running a marathon at a sprinter’s pa
 ce. Too often we don’t take the time to properly manage and maintain our
  internal systems until we are faced with a significant health issue - an 
 outage\, if you will. To prevent burnout and sustain high performance\, we
 llness shouldn’t be an afterthought. It needs to be integrated into our 
 system infrastructure.\n\nIn The Wellness OS\, we introduce the essential 
 components required to create a sustainable system for our wellbeing. When
  we prioritize a well stabilized infrastructure\, we are able to better ma
 nage stress\, increase performance\, have better relationships\, and spend
  time well.\nAfter participating in The Wellness OS\, you will:\n\n* Expan
 d your knowledge of wellness\n* Understand exactly where you are at with r
 egards to your wellness\n* Understand how the brain works for production c
 hanges\n* Define an optimized version of you\n* Design a plan for getting 
 started\n* Establish failback plans\n* Be ready to optimize the internals\
 n* Transform the Big Picture into a motivating force\n\nPresented by a CEO
  of a tech company and National Health Board certified health and wellbein
 g coach\, this series blends science backed methods with lived tech experi
 ence to provide a supportive\, practical\, and tailored approach to ambiti
 ous people who want to improve their wellbeing.
