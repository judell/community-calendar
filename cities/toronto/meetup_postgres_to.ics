SUMMARY:The Wellness OS: Evaluation Parameters
DESCRIPTION:Toronto Postgres\nIn *The Wellness OS: Getting to the Root*\, 
 we dove into where our internal OS begins and what shapes the MVP version.
  We looked at how expansive our internal systems really are when it comes 
 to wellness\, and began identifying our ideal system. We then discussed th
 e importance of root access and how in order to have a more fulfilled life
 \, we have to regain root access and be proactive stewards of our wellbein
 g.\n\nIn *The Wellness OS: Evaluation Parameters*\, we will dive deeper in
 to what wellness actually entails for us individually\, looking specifical
 ly into the systems we have adopted to “rate” our success. We will con
 tinue to define where we are at with regards to our systems\, and establis
 h further foundation for getting to where we want to be. We will dive into
  the science of how deprioritizing our health leads to things like inflamm
 ation\, chronic stress\, and a shortened lifespan. It’s time to re-evalu
 ate what our evaluation parameters are\, and look at things differently.
