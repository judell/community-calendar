SUMMARY:Gareth Long: Leopards\, Laughter\, Razors\, Drift
DESCRIPTION:Divided into three seemingly disparate but thematically related vignettes\, the works in this exhibition veer through these three research paths of interest: an aphorism by Franz Kafka\, a 1930s medical journal\, and King Camp Gillette of disposable razor fame. \nKafka’s aphorism about leopards breaking into a temple articulates how culture is produced and reproduced through repetition\, and the potential for change to occur when rituals are repeated. The French medical journal\, Ridendo\, which was published between 1933 and 1977\, took its name from the Latin phrase “castigat ridendo mores”\, meaning “one corrects customs by laughing at them”\, or “he corrects customs by ridicule”\, pointing to the possibility that humour and satire might have the potential to change societal mores. The American businessman King Camp Gillette\, credited with inventing the disposable razor blade in the early twentieth century and along with it the highly capitalist profit-oriented “razor and blade” business model\, also designed – prior to his business ventures – a never-realized moneyless\, car-less socialist utopia\, which was to be located near and powered by Niagara Falls. The works in the exhibition reflect on these contradictions\, and the failed calls for social change in Gillette’s utopian writings.

SUMMARY:Teenage Wasteland
DESCRIPTION:1991. Upstate New York. A group of teenage misfits\, inspired by a renegade English teacher\, embark on a student film project and uncover a vast conspiracy that is poisoning the ground beneath their feet. Banding together to confront the indifferent adults\, corrupt politicians and a violent criminal organization threatening their small town\, they produce an investigative documentary that causes shockwaves in their community. Teenage Wasteland is a coming-of-age story based on exclusive access to hundreds of hours of candid\, humorous and nostalgic video outtakes\, and the cooperation of Fred Isseks and his intrepid students as they reckon\, thirty years later\, with a defining event in their lives and a remarkable story of civic courage. \nJoin film subject Fred Isseks for a special post-screening discussion. \nFred Isseks was probably the most unconventional teacher at Middletown High School in the 1990s\, but also the teacher every student hoped to find on their schedule. His belief that students must learn by doing became central to his PhD thesis on Media Courage\, which he completed in 2003 at the prestigious European Graduate School in Switzerland. Since then\, Fred has remained dedicated to the cause – monitoring the landfill sites and the Wallkill River\, digitizing his records and archival footage of the investigation.

SUMMARY:Nobu Woods
DESCRIPTION:Nobu Woods is a Dominican-American singer\, songwriter\, and producer from Jamaica\, Queens\, known for his self-produced\, atmospheric approach to alternative R&B. Born to first-generation immigrants from the Dominican Republic\, Woods was raised on the rhythm-first sounds of bachata and merengue\, developing an early ear for melody and emotional storytelling. As a teenager\, he gravitated toward the moody\, nocturnal sounds of the early 2010s Toronto R&B scene\, listening to The Weeknd\, Drake\, and PARTYNEXTDOOR\, as well as the intensity of SoundCloud-era rap from Lil Uzi Vert\, Playboi Carti\, and Juice WRLD. These early regional scenes inspired him to begin teaching himself FL Studio at just 16 years old\, eventually moving from producing for friends to recording his own vocals after an engineer challenged him to explore writing. Beyond music\, his influences in film and philosophy shape his creative process. Drawing from filmmakers like Wong Kar-Wai and David Fincher\, his work carries a cinematic quality\, while his visuals often resemble short films influenced by his appreciation of horror. His introspective\, emotionally mature lyricism is informed by a deep interest in philosophy and writers such as Nietzsche\, Osho\, and Dostoevsky\, giving his songs a reflective weight. This interdisciplinary mindset has made him an uncommon voice in contemporary R&B\, a genre that has increasingly drifted from its foundations in emotional expression and romantic vulnerability.

SUMMARY:Nzinga
DESCRIPTION:Born in the Congo\, Tatiana Zinga Botao grew up in Brussels before moving to Quebec.
