SUMMARY:Shaking the Foundations: New Exhibit Celebrates Women Trailblazers in Toronto Music
DESCRIPTION:Toronto’s vibrant music scene has been built by scores of remarkable women whose contributions have often been overlooked or undervalued. Shaking the Foundations: Women Trailblazers in Toronto Music is a groundbreaking new exhibit at Friar’s Music Museum\, opening on March 21 2025\, that will honour and highlight many of these influential artists. \nShaking the Foundations is a Downtown Yonge BIA initiative\, presented in partnership with Toronto Music Experience and curated by longtime music writer Mary Dickie. As the first-ever exhibition to spotlight the creative and cultural impact of Toronto women in music\, it highlights the artists whose unique attitudes\, traditions\, and histories have shaped the city’s musical landscape across virtually every style and genre.

SUMMARY:Rough & Ready: A History of the Cowboy Boot
DESCRIPTION:The story of the cowboy boot is steeped in history and legend and is neither simple nor straightforward. Since their invention in the late nineteenth century\, cowboy boots have embodied contradiction. They have symbolized labor and leisure\, freedom and domination\, tradition and reinvention. Cowboy boots were born out of industrialization yet refined through expert craftsmanship\, they have been used to both celebrate individualism and forge cultural cohesion. They were central to the closing of the West\, yet endure as emblems of freedom and wide-open spaces. Over time\, cowboy boots have signaled power and privilege as well as resistance and reclamation. Whether worn in the saddle\, on screen\, or in the streets\, cowboy boots remain a cultural touchstone\, embodying both tradition and transformation in a constantly changing world.

SUMMARY:Art/Wear: Sneakers x Artists
DESCRIPTION:“What is art?” This question has sparked debate for centuries\, and today\, the boundaries of what defines art are being pushed further than ever. One significant shift is the growing trend of artists engaging in commercial collaborations\, particularly with sneaker brands. These collaborations blur the lines between art\, fashion\, and commerce\, offering consumers the opportunity to buy and wear creations by some of the most revered figures in the art world. Many of these sneakers are also finding their place within traditional art spaces\, such as museums and auction houses\, where their rarity has elevated them to a status similar to limited edition artist prints. The cultural significance of these artist-sneaker collaborations is contributing to the ongoing discussion of what defines art today. \nMany artists are increasingly using sneakers in conceptually rich ways to challenge and redefine conventional artistic boundaries. By manipulating the familiar form of sneakers\, these artists create provocative works that explore themes of consumerism\, personal expression\, and societal expectations. Through their deconstruction\, repurposing\, and political use of sneakers\, these artists invite viewers to reconsider the intersections between art\, fashion\, and identity in the modern world. \nArt/Wear: Sneakers and Artists asks why artists are drawn to working on/with sneakers and why so many of us are interested in wearing these pieces. It also explores the longstanding divide in Western thought between art and fashion\, ultimately questioning if and how our collective definitions of art are shifting. Topics explored include: a history of sneakers as canvases\, graffiti artists and sneakers\, and artist collabs\, and the rise of customization as its own art form. \nArtists on view: Aaron Fowler\, Alife\, Andrew Mania\, Bryant Giles\, Cey Adams\, Damien Hirst\, Daniel Arsham\, Dave White\, ESPO\, Futura\, Eric Haze\, Hebru Brantley\, Javier Calleja\, Jean-Michel Basquiat\, Judi Werthein\, Kate Knudsen\, KAWS\, Keith Haring\, Kenzo Minami\, Mache\, Michael Lau\, MSCHF\, Peter Max\, Ruohan Wang\, Shantell Martin\, Stash\, Takashi Murakami\, Tom Sachs\, Vicky Vuong\, and Virgil Abloh.

SUMMARY:Kosiv Bazaar • A Living Archive of the Carpathians
DESCRIPTION:KOSIV BAZAAR. A Living Archive of the CarpathiansPresented by the Ukrainian Museum of Canada\, Ontario BranchSeptember 5\, 2025 to March 2026 \nThere is a place in the west of Ukraine\, in the Carpathian Mountains\, where magic happens. Known as the Kosiv Bazaar\, it is here that the imagination is sparked\, creativity flows and the world meets. \nKosiv Bazaar • A Living Archive of the Carpathians is an exhibition drawn from the collection of Leonard Krawchuk\, inspired by the unique phenomenon of the Hutsul bazaar in Kosiv — a place where\, for centuries\, craft\, community\, and the beauty of everyday life have intersected. The Kosiv Bazaar is more than just a market – it is living memory\, cultural force\, and a space of gathering. \nThis exhibition presents Kosiv ceramics (inscribed in the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage\, 2019)\, woodwork\, brassware\, and “all the small things” that make up the spirit of the bazaar. Through the artistry of renowned master artisans\, the exhibition explores themes of sustainable craft\, inherited knowledge\, local economy\, and culture. From a clay pot to a woven towel\, from the shouts of sellers to quiet conversations between the stalls — every object preserves traces of exchanged stories\, shared goods\, and collective memory. \nWe invite you to experience an exhibition where trade becomes culture\, and the bazaar becomes a living metaphor for community. Guest Curator: Myroslava Boikiv \nSince 1944\, the Ukrainian Museum of Canada\, Ontario Branch  has brought Ukrainian culture and stories to life for Canadians – connecting generations and communities through engaging exhibitions and shared heritage. The Museum houses an extraordinary collection of over 8\,000 artifacts celebrating the richness of Ukrainian cultural heritage. From intricately embroidered textiles and traditional pysanky to hand-carved woodwork\, ceramics\, and sacred objects\, each piece tells a story of artistry\, identity\, and enduring tradition. \nOur mission is to collect\, preserve\, celebrate\, and share Ukrainian culture through compelling storytelling\, dynamic exhibitions\, educational programs\, research\, and community engagement. The Museum is located at St. Volodymyr Institute\, 620 Spadina Avenue in downtown Toronto. Admission is by donation. www.umcontario.com

SUMMARY:Beginner Friendly Kundalini Yoga ✵ West End
DESCRIPTION:🌿 Who This Is For:This class is designed for people who are doing a lot in the world and feel it in their nervous system. You do not need prior experience with kundalini yoga. \n​It’s especially supportive if you: \n\n​Often feel mentally “on” even when your body is resting\n​Notice it’s hard to fully settle\, slow down\, or switch gears\n​Carry a lot of responsibility and tend to hold it internally\n​Are ready to turn inward for self discovery and aren’t looking to perform or be impressive in the room\n\n​✨ What to Expect:This is not a traditional workout class. We use physical movement as a way to train the mind so that you can handle anything with clarity and ease. This one-hour class is structured to build your mental and emotional capacity. You’ll be guided every step of the way. \n​We begin with gentle breathwork to settle the nervous system\, followed by simple\, repetitive movements designed to release tension and restore your internal rhythm. If time allows\, we will practice a short calming meditation to close. \n​The emphasis is on: \n\n​Releasing tension and stagnant energy in the body\n​Building inner awareness by noticing sensations and reactions as they arise\n​Practicing how to stay present when things feel uncomfortable\n\n​👜 What to Bring:Please bring your yoga mat\, a water bottle to stay hydrated\, and a cushion/bolster for added comfort to your practice. Wearing white is optional. \n🧘🏻‍♀️ About the Instructor:As someone with a left-brain\, analytical mindset and a background in engineering\, I’ve always craved logic\, structure\, and systems that make sense. My classes tend to weave modern science & are grounded in my beliefs: \n\n​﻿﻿Accessible – all bodies welcome\n​﻿﻿Personal choice – students take what resonates and leave the rest\n​﻿﻿Subtle shifts – every practice is a stepping stone for personal growth\n\n​​The name Raising Potters is inspired by my favourite quote: “the most beautiful thing a potter makes is … the potter”. Like the potter\, our greatest achievement is not what we do\, but who we grow into along the way. My vision is to raise the next generation to connect within and tap into their inner power & beauty so that the world is full of authenticity and compassion.

SUMMARY:Sharks at ROM
DESCRIPTION:Sharks have intrigued humans for as long as we have explored the oceans. The terrifying monster from the movie Jaws is what many might imagine when they think of these animals\, but they are far more fascinating and complex than their depiction in popular culture. Did you know\, for example\, that there is a shark that eats seagrass? Or that some sharks can sense Earth’s magnetic field? \nPresented by Desjardins Financial Group\, this family-friendly exhibition invites you to uncover fresh perspectives\, groundbreaking research\, and the astounding diversity of this ancient group of fishes. \nDelve into the anatomy\, behaviour\, and history of sharks\, from familiar favourites like tiger sharks and great whites to lesser-known species like the dwarf lanternshark—a tiny\, light-producing marvel small enough to hold in your hand. \nThrough dozens of interactives and life-sized models\, including a life-size head of the huge extinct Megalodon\, join us for a unique look at these magnificent creatures\, their habitats\, hunting techniques\, and the conservation threats that they face. \nThis exhibition is organized by the American Museum of Natural History\, New York. The Museum gratefully acknowledges Warner Bros. Discovery for its generous support of Sharks. A selection of footage in Sharks has been provided by Discovery’s Shark Week.
