Today\, it remains a beloved staple of Italian culture — simple\, versatile\, and deeply connected to the joy of sharing good food. \nAll ingredients and equipment are provided\, you do not need to bring anything with you.

SUMMARY:Still-Life Painting: Ceremonial Lion Head
DESCRIPTION:This CNY\, celebrate with still-life painting! \nJoin us on Friday Feb 27 for an exciting after-hours Lion Head still-life painting session at Gwartzman’s Art Supplies. Running from 6:30–8:30 PM\, this session includes a two-hour sit with a traditional Chinese lion head (named Elmo!)\, all the materials you need\, and optional guided instruction. You’ll be leaving this session with your very own acrylic painting\, fun memories and new friends! \nRooted in traditions dating back over a thousand years\, Chinese lion dance developed as a communal ritual to bring good fortune\, ward off evil spirits\, and mark moments of celebration and renewal. Each lion carries its own character and personality\, brought to life through movement\, rhythm\, and craftsmanship—making it a rich and meaningful subject to observe and paint. \nThis lion head is generously provided by the Chinatown Community Lion Dance Club\, which meets every Tuesday from 7–9 PM at Hart House (until the end of February)\, and Tuesdays from 6:30–9:30 PM at Cecil starting in March. For more information\, email chinatowncommunityliondance@gmail.com. \nMaterials: \nCanvas  \nBrushes  \nPalette knives  \nGwartzman’s Acrylic Paints  \nTable Easels  \n*We ask that each participant bring an item that is meaningful to them. This item can align with the theme for year of the horse/lunar new year/renewal/strength/red\, etc.\, but theme is not mandatory. \n**Aprons not provided \nYour Instructor: \nAnson Ng is a Toronto-based artist whose practice explores how the spaces we share shape our history\, memory\, and cultural identity. His upbringing in a family-run restaurant continues to inform his interest in migration\, labour\, and shared experience. He paints small businesses and restaurants on site\, in the open on city streets\, treating them as sites of cultural significance within the Canadian diaspora\, and has painted in cities and provinces across Canada. Alongside this\, he paints Canadian natural landscapes in the open\, within outdoor and natural settings\, placing these works in conversation with one another. Through this dual focus\, Ng treats both the landscape of diaspora and the natural landscape as inseparable parts of the greater Canadian landscape\, using slow\, attentive painting to celebrate\, archive\, and honour the people\, places\, and histories that shape us.

SUMMARY:Belgian Beer MasterClass with Joke Van Loon
DESCRIPTION:Join us for this deep dive into saisons\, sours\, monks and microbes!  \nThis educational MasterClass will explore the history and variety of Belgian Beer and brewing\, along with a beer tasting with some light snacks. Belgian beer is some of the most beloved\, celebrated and\, as we’ll learn\, dangerous beers on Earth. These products have made a huge impact on markets all over the world\, including North America and our love for them is only growing.  \nWe will learn the fundamentals of brewing in general and then how the inhabitants of what we today call Belgium adapted and perfected these techniques over time. While the rest of Europe was out jousting or inventing new plagues in the Middle Ages\, monks were quietly improving sanitation\, perfecting fermentation and recording detailed brewing notes. We will explore these Trappist traditions and taste a variety of styles.  \nThese will include: Saisons\, Flemish Reds\, Trappist Ales and Tripels.  \nThe tasting will be accompanied by some thoughtfully paired meats\, cheeses\, small bites and sweets. \n—- \nJoke Van Loon is a Belgian beer enthusiast with a degree in clinical psychology who had a practice in Antwerp for a decade. Her passion for all things brewing led her to becoming a certified Zythologist at the PIVA culinary school in Antwerp. \nShe moved to Toronto in 2025 and devoted herself fully to her studies in beer\, creating Tasting Talks – a project that melds her fascination with the topic with her love for connecting people. Making beer culture fun\, approachable and engaging\, Joke aims to inspire creative tasting and exploring outside of one’s comfort zone.  \n‘The world of beer is so much bigger than most people imagine\, and I love creating welcoming spaces where they can learn\, explore\, discover new flavours\, and connect with others over great beer.’

SUMMARY:Little Willy
DESCRIPTION:After a sold-out run of Little Dickens in 2022\, world-renowned Canadian artist Ronnie Burkett returns to Canadian Stage with his irreverent army of marionettes\, this time with a sassy take on Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. \nBurlesque star Dolly Wiggler starts the show with an Elizabethan striptease in this riotously funny improvised mash-up of one of Shakespeare’s most beloved plays. All the leading ladies of the Daisy ensemble battle for the role of Juliet\, including faded diva Esme Massengill in a boozy interpretation of the lovesick ingénue. Beloved audience favourites Schnitzel and Mrs. Edna Rural are back in supporting roles\, and adding to the fun and mayhem\, The Bard himself joins The Daisy Theatre cast for a twisted retelling of this tragic romance – with strings attached. \nLittle Willy is intended for adult (16+) audiences only. Children under 16 will not be admitted.
