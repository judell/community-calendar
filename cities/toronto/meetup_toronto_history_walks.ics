 above from the Toronto Public Library archive is an old St. James receipt 
 from the mid 1800s.\n\nPrior to 1844\, the lands east of Parliament Street
  were known as the Garrison East for military purposes. York\, and then To
 ronto was restricted to the land south of Queen Street or Lot Street from 
 Parliament to Peter Street and Fort York to the west. With the population 
 starting to rise\, space was needed for a new cemetery out on the country\
 , as space was limited at the original cemetery at St. James Church downto
 wn on Church Street.\n\nIn July 1844 St. James opened for the burial of pe
 ople professing the Anglican faith. Most of the city's population of 18\,0
 00 lived south of Lot Street or today's Queen Street\, and the cemetery wa
 s regarded to be outside the city limits. The cemetery was necessary as th
 e church burial ground itself was filling up fast. It was in use since 179
 7.\n\nA crematorium was added in 1948\, and 95\,000 interments and 114\,00
 0 cremations have taken place at St. James. An historic land in the heart 
 of the city.\n\nIn many ways a walk through St. James is a walk through hi
 story. Like opening a book on our past!\n\nThis walking tour is for all le
 vels and walkers. The tour begins outside the Castle Frank Subway Station\
 , and ends at the gates of the cemetery after the tour.\n\nThis tour has a

 ted on September 5\, 2020! Six years of storytelling!\n\nToronto is a city
  of stories.\n\nIt's also a city constantly reinventing and learning about
  itself. It has been for the last 300 years. The people of Toronto are the
  storytellers\, and throughout its history\, women have been at the forefr
 ont of change.\n\nLike Elizabeth Neufeld\, Hester How\, Mary Pickford\, or
  Clara Martin stories that have shaped Toronto. Stories that have shaped t
 he lives of people in Toronto today.\n\nExplore the lives of ordinary wome
 n of Toronto who have made extraordinary impacts on our lives. From the de
 ath and destruction of war to the magic of Hollywood\, these women created
  their own endings. But for many in our city today these names and many ot
 hers are forgotten\, their accomplishments dusted over and buried in the m
 ists of time\, but not for long. These courageous Torontonians created one
  lasting story to be told: Their story!\n\nToronto is a city of meaning an
 d hidden stories indeed. Mary Pickford\, the first great screen Hollywood 
 star looks into the camera above. Born on University Avenue near College S
 treet\, she rewrote the Hollywood story and put Toronto on the film map.\n
 \nThis walk is for all fitness levels.\n\nThe meeting place for this impor
 tant walking adventure is the Barbara Ann Scott Ice Trail behind College P
 ark at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and College Street. We end our

 e following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nFirst it was
  **Ambrose Small** and my team of brilliant detectives who tried to figure
  it all out. The walkers on this tour just about cracked the case. Well do
 ne my detectives. But your smarts are needed again however. The Harley Kar
 ulis Detective Agency needs your help! And this one needs all our brain po
 wer to figure out. This one might be the toughest assignment yet.\n\nHere 
 is your case file. The details you will need to get started on this walkin
 g tour.\n\nA case that shocked Torontonians when it occurred in late Octob
 er of 1933\, and still reverberates to this day. A cold case solved\, not 
 by a long shot. No one really knows the entire story or the truth. It unfo
 lds like an Agatha Christie novel as you will see.\n\nThe details of this 
 case culminates in one of the most perplexing\, head scratching crimes in 
 the history of this city and very few have heard of the sad life and end o
 f little Alfreda Dolores Mae Hillier.\n\nLittle Bunty as they called her w
 as born in 1932\, and was the apple of her parent's eyes. Her father Alfre
 d Hillier was a World War 1 hero\, and had fallen on bad times during the 
 depression years. He just started a new job recently. Her mother Florence 
 was a stay at home mom and loved to play and watch her little girl out the
  window of their small home on Boothroyd Avenue in Leslieville.\n\nOn a co
 ol\, sunny October afternoon at the height of the depression\, Alfreda\, a
 n 18 month old girl disappeared after heading out for a walk alone. Sounds
  on the level I must say. Warning bells!\n\nWithin a few hours questions a
 s to what happened to this little girl started to swirl around the neighbo
 urhood. All details of this case are taken directly from the archives of t
 he Toronto Star and the city which paint a rather confused story culminati
 ng in the arrest of two young boys\, one age 4 and the other 7 who admitte
 d their guilt. Or was coerced into that same confession?\n\nLet's toss in 
 a few more details to cloud the story however:\n\n1) a convicted criminal 
 in the area\, information told to the Calgary Hearld the day after she was
  found dead.\n\n2) another man who seemed to be present when she was found
  and then wandered off and disappeared from the police investigation file.
 \n\n3) the testimony of two underaged children that had no relevance to so
 me of the details.\n\n4) the coroner's report which contradicted just abou
 t everything the police came up with and witnesses testimony as well.\n\nT
 his walking tour/game takes participants back in time to 1933 and explores
  the many sites associated with the tragic death of Alfreda Hillier\, and 
 the personalities involved. You will be introduced to 10 historic characte
 rs and each has their own dark secrets\, it will be up to you to render a 
 **verdict**! Are you up for it detectives?\n\nOur walk begins at the **Jon
 es Branch of the Toronto Public Library** at the southwest corner of Jones
  Avenue and Dundas Street East in Leslieville just a few blocks north of Q
 ueen Street East.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person. Pl
 ease get your tickets early if you would like to attend.\n\n\\*\\* **Pleas

  historic Little India is a true Toronto success story\, a unique look at 
 a neighbourhood and the people who call it home. But the story is not alwa
 ys a happy one. Like all other areas in Toronto\, Little India started out
  as a purely English - Anglican area and was repeatedly changed as other i
 mmigrants opted to leave the security of the downtown core for outer areas
 .\n\nWith the opening of the Naaz theatre in 1972\, the community that bec
 ame Little India started to take shape\, but in Toronto the forces that de
 veloped communities were different in that part of the city sandwiched bet
 ween Leslieville to the south\, and Greektown to the north.\n\nWith a stri
 ctly Anglo-Saxon pro-British community entrenched for over 100 years\, now
  changing to include south Asians\, the area was seen as a rather depresse
 d area\, or an area in transition\, and violence was an unfortunate part o
 f life. Racial tensions increased dramatically with the influx of south As
 ians.\n\nBut by the 1980s and 1990s the district had found its feet\, and 
 Little India was a popular Toronto district and tourist attraction\, with 
 visitors pouring in from around the world to partake of the richness. A tr
 ue cultural enclave in Toronto! A fascinating history and a fascinating co
 mmunity awaits! This tour has been revised a few times to add more histori
 c information to the walk\, it has been revised once again for 2026 with n
 ew landmarks and stories attached. Should be a fascinating walk!\n\nThis w
 alk is for all fitness levels. The meeting place for our walking adventure
  is on the southwest corner of Greenwood Avenue and Gerrard Street East!\n

  on Walmer Road awaits your inspection. This time we are needed as **juror
 s** to figure the case out and add a fresh perspective. Are you up for thi
 s interactive game once again?\n\nThe story shocked the city back in Febru
 ary of 1915.\n\nHow a young teenage maid shot and killed her boss on Walme
 r Road in the Annex made headlines across Canada and around the world. But
  it was the name of that boss that made people gasp\, the Massey family\, 
 from the famous music hall of the same name on Shuter Street in downtown T
 oronto! And people talked and tried to come up with explanations.\n\nBut t
 he following trial exposed the undercurrents of Toronto life\, and the cla
 ss system that was in place. This trial changed Toronto at a crucial time 
 in its history. The first World War was raging in Europe\, and residents o
 f the city now had something else to think about.\n\nMurder!\n\nHow this c
 ould have happened to an upper middle class family in the centre of Toront
 o\, the Annex neighbourhood was rife with theory and fears.\n\nThis walkin
 g tour/game takes participants back in time to the 1915 trial and explores
  the many sites associated with the trial and the personalities involved. 
 You will be introduced to 15 historic characters and each has their own da

 the Toronto Club\, Old City Hall and the Morgue are explored and their sto
 ries exposed.\n\n**This tour requires a PRESTO card for TTC as this tour u
 ses transit to get around the city for stops outside the downtown core. On
 e could call it a hop on hop off walking tour!**\n\nOur walk begins on the
  steps of Old City Hall at the northeast corner of Bay Street and Queen St
 reet West. We end the tour at the site of the murder in the Annex for the 
 reading of the verdict! Just like in the Ambrose Small case\, we end where

 ed by Doctor Joseph Workman who wanted a resort type feel to the hospital.
  The architect was Kivas Tully\, who worked with gardener Samuel Matheson.
  Most of the buildings were built by the patients themselves\, and helped 
 with laundry duties\, and tended to the vast gardens.\n\nBut a different s
 tory emerged that most Canadians had no idea about. And that was the story
  of Camp M - Mimico.\n\nIn 1887\, the Victoria Industrial School for Boys 
 opened on old Horner Avenue in Mimico\, just blocks from the site of the n
 ew Mimico Hospital for the Insane (Humber College.) The school\, which was
  a juvenile reformatory\, hoped to break the bad boys through moral and ac
 ademic education and old fashioned hard work. I hope there was a positive 
 outcome.\n\nIn 1927\, the school changed its name to the Mimico Reform Sch
 ool. But it was the war years 1939-1945 that really surprised me as a Toro
 ntonian. It was known as Camp M or Internment Camp 22\, the largest camp f
 or POWs in the centre of a large Canadian city.\n\nMost camps were constru
 cted in rural areas\, and the camp provided space for more than 520 German
  nationals. The history of this camp is fascinating and had links to the T
 oronto Central Prison on Strachan Avenue and the Mimico Hospital directly 
 to the south on lakeshore where we begin this tour.\n\nThis walking tour i
 s for all levels and walkers. The tour begins at the New Toronto Public Li
 brary Branch at 110 Eleventh Street just south of Lakeshore. We end this t
 our at Kipling and Horner Avenue\, just a few blocks to the north of the o
 ld hospital!\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\

  real heart of the Jewish community in Toronto. Most information in books 
 about Toronto's Jewish community tends to forget that Baldwin Village was 
 the epic centre of the migration west out of the "Ward\," and that the wor
 ld famous Baycrest Hospital was established in Baldwin Village.\n\nThe mig
 ration west continued in the early to mid twentieth century\, and the Jewi
 sh residents established the Jewish Market in Kensington Market\, and from
  there to Bathurst and Lawrence area.\n\nA fascinating story of heartbreak
  and heroism amid the horror of war and holocaust. An important walk for u
 s all! A lesson from the past needed today!\n\nAlong the way we will explo
 re the history of the Jewish Community\, The Christie Pits Riot\, the infa
 mous Swastika Club of Woodbine Beach\, The Holocaust\, and Toronto's place
  before\, during and after this sad and tragic historical event. Our tour 
 begins in the mid-19th century\, and ends with the liberation of Europe in
  May of 1945. We will discuss ways to promote this history and how to tack
 le intolerance!\n\nThis is our fifth annual event!\n\nThis walking tour is
