 e following email at:**\n**torontohistorywalks@gmail.com**\n\nFirst it was
  **Ambrose Small** and my team of brilliant detectives who tried to figure
  it all out. The walkers on this tour just about cracked the case. Well do
 ne my detectives. But your smarts are needed again however. The Harley Kar
 ulis Detective Agency needs your help!\n\nThe famous murder of Burt Massey
  on Walmer Road awaits your inspection. This time we are needed as **juror
 s** to figure the case out and add a fresh perspective. Are you up for thi
 s interactive game once again?\n\nThe story shocked the city back in Febru
 ary of 1915.\n\nHow a young teenage maid shot and killed her boss on Walme
 r Road in the Annex made headlines across Canada and around the world. But
  it was the name of that boss that made people gasp\, the Massey family\, 
 from the famous music hall of the same name on Shuter Street in downtown T
 oronto! And people talked and tried to come up with explanations.\n\nBut t
 he following trial exposed the undercurrents of Toronto life\, and the cla
 ss system that was in place. This trial changed Toronto at a crucial time 
 in its history. The first World War was raging in Europe\, and residents o
 f the city now had something else to think about.\n\nMurder!\n\nHow this c
 ould have happened to an upper middle class family in the centre of Toront
 o\, the Annex neighbourhood was rife with theory and fears.\n\nThis walkin
 g tour/game takes participants back in time to the 1915 trial and explores
  the many sites associated with the trial and the personalities involved. 
 You will be introduced to 15 historic characters and each has their own da
 rk secrets\, it will be up to you to render a **verdict** in this case. Gu
 ilty\, or Not Guilty\, and was the trial fair\, those are the questions th
 at need answering! Are you up for it?\n\nSites like the National Club and 
 the Toronto Club\, Old City Hall and the Morgue are explored and their sto
 ries exposed.\n\n**This tour requires a PRESTO card for TTC as this tour u
 ses transit to get around the city for stops outside the downtown core. On
 e could call it a hop on hop off walking tour!**\n\nOur walk begins on the
  steps of Old City Hall at the northeast corner of Bay Street and Queen St
 reet West. We end the tour at the site of the murder in the Annex for the 
 reading of the verdict! Just like in the Ambrose Small case\, we end where
  it all begins!\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person. Plea
 se get your tickets early if you would like to attend.\n\n\\*\\* **Please

 oe named the area now known as Mimico for the thousands of pigeons that bl
 ackened the sky at the western end of the settlement. Mimico was originall
 y located at the confluence of Mimico Creek and Dundas Street.\n\nWilliam 
 Gamble\, opened a sawmill and built a settlement for the workers nearby. E
 tobicoke's first church\, Christ Church was opened on Church Street which 
 became Royal York Road. Mimico is a walkable neighbourhood and a great pla
 ce to stroll and discover our amazing history.\n\nThe Lakeshore Hospital w
 as built in 1888 as the Mimico Asylum\, its doors opened on January 21\, 1
 889.\n\nThe original idea for the hospital was a series of cottages design
 ed by Doctor Joseph Workman who wanted a resort type feel to the hospital.
  The architect was Kivas Tully\, who worked with gardener Samuel Matheson.
  Most of the buildings were built by the patients themselves\, and helped 
 with laundry duties\, and tended to the vast gardens.\n\nBut a different s
 tory emerged that most Canadians had no idea about. And that was the story
  of Camp M - Mimico.\n\nIn 1887\, the Victoria Industrial School for Boys 
 opened on old Horner Avenue in Mimico\, just blocks from the site of the n
 ew Mimico Hospital for the Insane (Humber College.) The school\, which was
  a juvenile reformatory\, hoped to break the bad boys through moral and ac
 ademic education and old fashioned hard work. I hope there was a positive 
 outcome.\n\nIn 1927\, the school changed its name to the Mimico Reform Sch
 ool. But it was the war years 1939-1945 that really surprised me as a Toro
 ntonian. It was known as Camp M or Internment Camp 22\, the largest camp f
 or POWs in the centre of a large Canadian city.\n\nMost camps were constru
 cted in rural areas\, and the camp provided space for more than 520 German
  nationals. The history of this camp is fascinating and had links to the T
 oronto Central Prison on Strachan Avenue and the Mimico Hospital directly 
 to the south on lakeshore where we begin this tour.\n\nThis walking tour i
 s for all levels and walkers. The tour begins at the New Toronto Public Li
 brary Branch at 110 Eleventh Street just south of Lakeshore. We end this t
 our at Kipling and Horner Avenue\, just a few blocks to the north of the o
 ld hospital!\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\

 changed over the last few years. But what were the events that propelled t

 y changed the city for good and some say for bad.\n\nBuildings have been e
 rected and others torn down\, but certain happenings in the city changed t

  time. Today\, we see the outcome of let's say Hurricane Hazel's fury\, th

 4.\n\nThe first Great Fire\, Christie Pits Riot\, War of 1812\, Constance 
 Hamilton\, Hurricane Hazel\, and the creation of the Toronto Islands\, all
  changed Toronto's destiny. But over time\, those landmark stories have be
 en forgotten. We need to bring them back and highlight them for the next g

  day in 1985\, Air India flight 182 left Toronto Pearson headed east for M
 ontreal\, London\, and onward to India\, with 329 passengers and crew. The
  flight never reached London. It was destroyed by a suitcase bomb over the
  north Atlantic Ocean off the shores of Ireland\, resulting in one of the 
 most complicated and politically sensitive investigation in recent Canadia
 n history. Since a vast majority of the passengers were Canadians\, this w
 as the worst terrorist attack against Canadians in our history.\n\nThe out
 come divided families and shone a spotlight on wrong doing at all levels h
 ere and abroad. A fascinating story\, but a tragic one for the victims. Th
 is tour looks at the story in detail and the fallout.\n\nThis tour also ex
 amines the history of the Humber Bay Shores\, and the historic Mimico Cree

 ed in Toronto during the late 19th century\, and first settled in the old 
 "Ward\," centred at the corner of University Avenue and College Street. Ov
 er the next few years 40\,000 Italians came to Canada between 1914 to 1918
 \, mostly from southern Italy.\n\nMost Italians had moved west of Bathurst
  Street and the College Street area had emerged as the city's Italian encl
 ave. By the 1920s\, the community we know today as Little Italy emerged as
  a cultural and historic jewel in Toronto!\n\nLeaving southern Italy the m
 ajority immigrated to Toronto—increasing from 4\,900 in 1911\, to 9\,000
  in 1921\, or two percent of Toronto's population at the time.\n\nBut it w
 as the massive influx of Italians after the second world war that changed 
 Toronto forever. They brought a cultural revolution to the way Torontonian
 s thought\, interacted socially\, and ate and of course drank coffee. The 
 sidewalk cafe and patio is one of those things that evolved when the Itali
 ans came to town. And coffee is the best part of waking up\, no that's Max

 on of Toronto's downtown started on a windy\, cold night in early spring. 
 The above sentence sounds like a mystery novel set in Victorian England. B
 ut things were about to heat up in old hog town on that April evening. As 
 the workday ended at the E&S Currie Neckwear company on Wellington Street 
 at Bay Street\, on April 19\, 1904\, a tiny flicker of light spelled disas
 ter for the entire city.\n\nA police officer on the downtown beat spotted 
 smoke and flames at precisely 8 pm. He headed to the emergency call box on
  King Street at Bay to alert the fire department\, but by then\, the fire 
 had spread to the adjacent buildings. The fire department responded to a f
 iery nightmare as most of Wellington Street was already in flames. Moreove
 r\, the night was turning colder\, and a stiff wind blew in from the north
 . Toronto's second great fire was about to explode out of control.\n\nToro
 nto was well aware of the dangers of fire. In April of 1849\, a small fire
  started in stables near the corner of Jarvis and King Streets and destroy
 ed the old downtown including St. James Church\, and the market. By the ti
 me the fire was out most of the core of the old city was in ashes. Toronto
 \, after the great fire of 1849\, was a different place. The old town was 
 centred around St. James Church\, and the commercial district was then on 
 King Street East. With the great fire and its aftermath\, there was a shif
 t west\, both physically and emotionally\; the central core moved to Yonge
  and King Streets as the city spread. Now the heart of the business distri
 ct was at risk once again. And the stakes were much higher.\n\nThe fire th
 at had started at the E&S Currie Neckwear Company spread quickly along bot
 h sides of Wellington Street\, as far as Yonge Street to the east and York
  Street to the west. But with a stiff wind blowing\, embers touched off ot
 her fires to the south and southeast\, threatening the historic Bank of Mo
 ntreal building at Yonge and Front Streets. Ships docked at the Yonge Stre
 et and Church Street piers were moved to safety\, and documents from the o
 ld customs house were packed up and moved to other venues around the city.
  Some business owners who had managed to get into their businesses removed
  precious documents before the flames engulfed their premises.\n\nFirefigh
 ters held their ground at several points\, putting up fire lines\, includi
 ng Yonge Street just feet west of the old Bank and around the majestic Que
 en's Hotel. Help came in the form of Queen's Hotel guests\, and staff as t
 hey moved from room to room and tore down draperies\, and dampened the woo
 den window sills. Their efforts saved the Queen's Hotel and possibly the r
 est of the downtown\, including the old Union Station south of Front Stree
 t. Had the Queen's Hotel been destroyed\, the rest of the city may have be
 en destroyed as well.\n\nEight hours after the fire was first spotted\, it
  was brought under control. Residents and business owners fled to the down
 town core to watch their lives go up in smoke. Thousands of curious people
  crowded the streets around the burned area. Toronto would have to be rebu
 ilt\, and fire would be tamed through laws and building restrictions. But 
 out of the great fire of 1904\, a new modern city emerged\; one such build
 ing was the new Union Station which was built on the ruins. The city hasn'
 t suffered a great fire like the one in 1904\, but came close to disaster 
 in 1977\, with the Eaton's Annex fire. That fire just about destroyed the 
 new Eaton Centre. Where would we shop\, that is the question of the day? a
 nd let's not forget 1871. And everyone thought Toronto was boring!\n\nThis
  walk is for all fitness levels. Please dress for the weather. This walk b
 egins and ends outside St. James Cathedral at 106 King Street East at Chur
 ch Street.\n\nThis tour has a ticketed price of $15.00 per person!\n\n\\*\

 has many faces.\n\nAnd over the years those faces have become sharper and 
 clearer to residents and visitors alike. The tone has changed in Parkdale.
  And that is always a good thing.\n\nOne of the main reasons why Toronto H
 istory Walks came into being was simply because the images of Parkdale at 
 the time\, 2019\, seemed to convey a negative picture of the neighbourhood
 . Toronto residents wanted to avoid Parkdale at all costs based on assumpt
 ions. It was dangerous and better to avoid than explore.\n\nBut those idea
 s have changed over the last several years. Parkdale is a great place to e
 xplore\, have a cup of coffee or dinner and check out the arts and enterta
 inment or take a stroll down a side street in one of the best preserved Vi
 ctorian neighbourhoods in Toronto.\n\nWelcome to Toronto's first suburb\, 
 the floral suburb. And it truly is a remarkable place to get to know. What
  Parkdale needed most was understanding. And this walk provides the intere
 sted walker with that understanding of how Parkdale came to be\, and why i
 t had a rather sketchy history right from its inception in 1879. And it ha
 d to do more with the attitudes of the residents than reality. Attitudes t
 hat followed the growth of Parkdale to this very day. Parkdale just can't 
 get free of its own legacy!\n\nFrom its beginnings in 1850 to the controve
 rsy surrounding the Gardiner Expressway\, and the death of Sunnyside Amuse
 ment Park\, the story of Parkdale unfolds\, and it has a remarkable abilit
 y to climb out of depressed economic periods. This is a detailed explorati
 on of the district.\n\nThis tour begins at the southwest corner of King\, 
 Queen\, and Roncesvalles\, at the Polish memorial Katyn\, just east of the
  Sunnyside pedestrian bridge across the street from the McDonald's.\n\nWe 
 wind our way through West Parkdale\, and end the tour at the TTC stop for 
 St. Joseph's Health Centre on the site of Sunnyside Villa!\n\nThis 2 hour 
 walking tour is for all walking levels. Please dress for the season\, and 
 hope to see you there.\n\nThis tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per perso
 n!\n\n\\*\\* **Please note: Please e-transfer the ticket amount when booki
