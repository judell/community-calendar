SUMMARY:Sacred Seasons Series: Yoga for Women -Perimenopause\, Menopause & Beyond
DESCRIPTION:Sacred Seasons is a 4-class yoga series designed to support women through the evolving phases of midlife\, from perimenopause through menopause and into postmenopause.\nThese seasons are not linear\, and neither are our experiences. Many women continue to feel the physical\, emotional\, and energetic shifts of menopause long after the transition itself\, making shared space and understanding especially powerful.\nEach 60-minute session weaves together gentle\, supportive yoga\, breathwork\, guided journaling\, and intentional conversation\, creating space for reflection\, regulation\, and connection. Together\, we’ll explore themes of change\, strength\, rest\, and renewal\, honoring the wisdom that comes with this stage of life while building community through shared experience. \nAll bodies\, backgrounds\, and stages are welcome. Come as you are. This is a place to move\, reflect\, and be seen.

SUMMARY:Sacred Seasons Series: Yoga for Women - Perimenopause\, Menopause & Beyond
DESCRIPTION:Sacred Seasons is a 4-week class yoga series designed to support women through the evolving phases of midlife\, from perimenopause through menopause and into post-menopause. These seasons are not linear\, and neither are our experiences. Many women continue to feel the physical\, emotional\, and energetic shifts of menopause long after the transition itself\, making shared space and understanding especially powerful. Each 60-minute session weaves together gentle\, supportive yoga\, breathwork\, guided journaling\, and intentional conversation\, creating space for reflection\, regulation\, and connection. Together\, we’ll explore themes of change\, strength\, rest\, and renewal\, honoring the wisdom that comes with this stage of life while building community through shared experience. All bodies\, backgrounds\, and stages are welcome. Come as you are. This is a place to move\, reflect\, and be seen.
