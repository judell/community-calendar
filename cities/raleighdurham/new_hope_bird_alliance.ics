 meeting at 7:30 pm\n\nPainted Bunting in the Southeast: Merging Traditional
  Science and Citizen Science\n\nOur January speaker is John Gerwin. He is a
  Research Scientist and the Curator of Birds at the North Carolina Museum o
 f Natural Sciences. John's research is on the life cycles of migratory bird
 s with a focus on breeding biology. He is currently studying Painted Buntin
 gs and Black-throated Green\, Swainson's and Golden-winged Warblers. He enj
 oys doing a wide variety of public programs\, including for Special Needs a
 nd several teenage groups. He also co-leads trips to tropical realms. His p
 rogram this month will feature the Painted Bunting\, a bird known as "non p
 areil" (without equal). For such a dramatic-looking bird\, surprisingly few
  studies have focused on it - until recently. John will showcase highlights
  from collaborative work involving range-wide surveys\, radio telemetry\, n
 esting biology\, and a large-scale citizen science/banding component.

 ttributed to habitat degradation. However\, Mark's research suggests that t

 en they can avoid nest site competition with Eastern Bluebirds. Bluebird-pr

 effective way to enhance nuthatch breeding success. We will have such boxes
  for sale at the meeting for $15.\n\nRefreshments will be served!\n \nWhere

DESCRIPTION:<p>Artificial Light at Night (aka\, light pollution) is a globa
 l issue that affects all wildlife. Research shows that artificial light imp
 acts birds' ability to navigate\, mate and reproduce\, and sleep at the app
 ropriate time.<br></p><p><br>In chicks\, artificial light activates cortiso
 l (fight or flight) and glucose (blood sugar)\, while suppressing melatonin
  (sleep hormone)\, which could lead to issues stemming from lack of sleep a
 nd altered nutrient allocation. These issues especially effect the metaboli
 c system\, which could lead to various metabolic diseases\, such as avian d
 iabetes.<br><br>Murry Burgess is a wildlife biologist at NCSU. She is a mem
 ber of NC State's Public Science Cluster - a group dedicated to making scie
 nce more accessible and understandable. Her public engagement is informed b
 y her lived experience as a Black woman from the Deep South pursuing a care

DESCRIPTION:Co-sponsored by NHAS and the Morehead Planetarium.\nTitle: The 
 End of Night?\nA starry night is one of nature's most magical wonders. Yet 
 in our artificially lit world\, most of us no longer experience true darkne
 ss. In this talk based on his book THE END OF NIGHT\, Paul Bogard seeks to 
 restore our awareness of the spectacularly primal\, wildly dark night sky a
 nd how it has influenced the human experience across everything from scienc
 e to art. Using a blend of personal narrative\, natural history\, science\,
  and astronomy\, Bogard shares the importance of darkness--what we've lost\
 , what we still have\, and what we might regain--and the simple ways we can
  reduce the brightness of our nights tonight.

 who will discuss the Piedmont Barn Owl Initiative. The Barn Owl (Tyto alba)
  was once a common resident of central North Carolina farmlands\, where she
 ltered wooden structures and large fields were present. Recent research has
  shown that placement of properly designed nest boxes\, in appropriate habi
 tat\, can dramatically improve population densities of these amazing birds.
  There is no charge for this meeting and everyone\, including nonmembers\, 
 is welcome.

 her good things) in Bhutan.\n                   Our guest speaker this mont
 h is Norm Budnitz\, current President of New Hope Audubon.  Norm earned his
  PhD studying lemurs at Duke (and in Madagascar) and then taught at Carolin
 a Friends School for 2 decades.  He has been interested in birds since he w
 as 10 years old.\nBhutan is a tiny Buddhist country in the Himalayas betwee
 n India and China.  Its geography makes it a wonderful place to see a wide 
 diversity of Asian bird species in many different habitats.  Its altitude c
 an be challenging\, its narrow\, winding roads can be a bit heart-thumping\
 , but its beauty is simply spectacular.  Hornbills and blood pheasants\, la
 ngurs and yaks\, dzongs and stupas--Bhutan is the country that coined the n
 otion of 'gross national happiness.' There is no charge for this meeting an
 d everyone\, including nonmembers\, is welcome.

DESCRIPTION:Kent Fiala - A Birding Tour of Cuba\n\nKent Fiala was among a g
 roup of 12 birders from the Carolina Bird Club who toured Cuba early this y
 ear. The group saw 147 bird species\, including all 24 of the Cuban endemic
 s that are realistically possible to see\, including Cuba's national bird -
  the Cuban Trogon\, and the world's smallest bird - the Bee Hummingbird. Al
 so seen were an additional 24 species that are endemic to the West Indies\,
  but not to Cuba\, such as the Great Lizard-Cuckoo and flamingos. The group
  also visited Che Guevara's hideout\, the Bay of Pigs\, and Hemingway's fav
 orite bars.\n\nKent Fiala is a past President and Vice-President of the Cha
 pel Hill Bird Club and has spoken to the club several times about his resea
 rch and travels. He is active in the Carolina Bird Club and runs their web

DESCRIPTION:Field Trip: Bird Walk at Kellam-Wyatt Farm\nWhere: 731 N Rogers
  Lane\, Raleigh (just up the road from Anderson Point Park)\nWhen: Saturday
 \, January 3\, 2015\, 9am-11am\nDetails: Kellam-Wyatt Farm consists of 58 a
 cres and is roughly one-third fields\, one-third woods\, and one-third pond
 s. The diverse habitat attracts a variety of birds\, including water birds 
 such as herons\, kingfishers\, cormorants\, Osprey and ducks. Hooded Mergan
 sers and Ring-necked Ducks often visit in January. We’ll also have the chan
 ce to see sparrows\, hawks\, kinglets\, woodpeckers\, and more.  \nAbout a 
 year ago\, the farmers/owners\, Bob Kellam and Susan Wyatt\, placed a conse
 rvation easement on the farm to limit its future use to sustainable farming
 \, nature education\, and wildlife habitat. The City of Oaks Foundation is 
 the holder of the easement and is a non-profit organization whose purposes 
 include conserving green-space in Raleigh and promoting opportunities for c
 hildren to learn about the outdoors through city park programs (including p
 roviding scholarships for children who could not otherwise participate). Bo
 b and Susan expect to eventually donate the land itself to a partnership th
 at will manage its use under the terms of the easement.\nRSVP: Due to a sho
 rtage of parking space\, we need to limit the number of participants to the
  first 20 who sign up. Please RSVP to Karen Bearden at chickadeebirders@ear
 thlink.net. She will send directions and other details to participants by J
 anuary 1.

 t really understanding what we mean by the term.  I will talk about the var
 ious concepts of species currently in use\, why most ornithologists use the
  biological species concept\, and how we determine which populations are sp
 ecies and which are not.  I will talk extensively about the process of spec
 iation\, whereby a single species splits into two or more\, and show why th
 at process is the engine that drives all evolution.  Illustrating the talk 
 will be many examples from my years of field work on islands of the Pacific
 .

DESCRIPTION:Dear Friend\,\n\nGreetings to you and your family.\n\nMy name i
 s Mr. Abdulaiye Rahmani\, The current Auditor of a bank here in Ouagadougou
 \, Burkina Faso\, West Africa. I have a transaction of US$9.5 Million dolla
 rs for transferring into your home bank account for our mutual benefits and
  i need your total and 100% cooperation and assistance to realize this task
 .\n\nFurther details about the fund\, its source and whom will stand as a b
 usiness partner to consulting. enterprise so that my bank can transferred t
 his fund into your receiving bank account immediately as I have your positi
 ve response. You must assure me that everything will be handled confidentia
 lly as I am assuring you that all your details required for this transactio
 n are all safe and secure. We will never lack again in life if we can join 
 hands together for making this deal a success.\n\nIt has been over 9 years 
 now that in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$9.500.000 (N
 ine million Five hundred thousand US dollars) In an account belongs to cons
 ulting enterprise in our country Burkina Faso that political part sign a co
 ntact with him and move huge amount of Funds into their various overseas co
 unterparts bank accounts through the help of their Political advisers.\n\nM
 ost of the funds which they transferred out of the West Africa were realize
 d from material consultants\, these are the funds meant for the development
  of our country Burkina Faso and their various Nations being taken away for
  their greedy and selfish ambition.\n\nTheir Political advisers always infl
 ated the amounts before transferring it into foreign accounts\, so I also t
 ook the opportunity to diverted part of these funds\, hence I am aware that
  there is no official trace of how much was transferred as all the accounts
  used for such transactions were being closed after each transfer.\n\nI as 
 the major Account Officer to most of those politicians and the then Foreign
  Remittance Dept Director of the bank\, when I discovered that they were us
 ing me to succeed in their greedy invents\, I also cleaned some of their ba
 nking records from the Bank files and no one ever cared to ask me because t
 he money was too much for them to control. They laundered over US$964 Milli
 on Dollars during the process.\n\nAs I am sending you this message\, I have
  the ability to transfer the diverted Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand Do
 llars ($9.5 M) into you own bank account abrade from an escrow account belo
 nging to no one in the bank.\n\nThe bank is anxious now to know who his bus
 iness partner to consulting enterprise to this fund is because they have ma
 de a lot of profits with the funds. It is more than Nine years now and most
  of the politicians are no longer using our bank to transfer funds overseas
  as most of the have died and the rest are no more in power.\n\nThe US$9.5 
 Million Dollars has been lying fallow and I don't want to retire from the b
 ank without transferring the funds to a foreign account to enable me share 
 the proceeds with the receiver. The money will be shared 60% for me and 40%
  for you with expenses. There is no one coming to ask you any question what
 soever about the funds because I secured everything. Further details shall 
 be mailed to you if only you show any sign of seriousness and interest.\n\n
 Please reply me by this email : a.rahmani@voila.fr\n\nBest Regard\,\nMr.Abd
 ulaiye Rahmani

DESCRIPTION:Leader Doug Shadwick writes:  The local lake levels have droppe
 d to a level where a few shorebirds\, etc. are stopping by on their souther
 n migration.  Thus\, field trips for the Chapel Hill Bird Club will begin. 
 We will concentrate on finding migrating shorebirds and other migrants.  Th
 e field trip may entail walking several miles over railroad beds\, stone em
 bankments\, fields of wet sedge and marsh grass and possibly soft mud and w
 ater.   Please dress appropriately with attention paid to spending several 
 hours in the sun and the possibility of tick and insect attacks.  This fiel
 d trip will be of longer duration than is typical - return to cars may be n
 oon or later.\n\nAs is usual for these field trips\, binoculars are a must 
 have and spotting scopes are highly desirable.  Photographic equipment is o
 ptional.  Also\, please plan to pack water and snacks for your self.  It wi
 ll almost surely be hot and humid as the morning progresses with little sha
 de relief on the lake banks and mudflats.\n\nThe local field trips will ori
 ginate in the Glen Lennox parking lot on highway 54 in Chapel Hill. We leav
 e the parking lot at 7:00 A.M..  For the Falls Lake field trips\, you can a
 lso meet us at the Hickory Hills boat ramps off of Redwood Road at about 7:
 30 A.M..  Please note that we will leave Glen Lennox at 7:00AM to try and a
 void the heat.\n\nDoug Shadwick (919-942-0479 or dougshadwick@nc.rr.com)\n

DESCRIPTION:Michael Tove is a Ph.D. Ornithologist\, member and past chair o
 f the NC Bird Records Committee\, and author of “A Field Guide to the Offsh
 ore Wildlife of the Northern Atlantic.” But he started birding as a hawk-wa
 tching enthusiast. In the 1970’s\, he was a volunteer counter at Hawk Mount
 ain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania. In the 1980’s he maintained the hawk-watch c
 ount in the Wellsville Mountains of Utah\, where access to the lookout requ
 ired a 4 mile hike (each way) to the top of a 9000 foot mountain ridge.\n \
 nMike's talk is more than a slide show about birds of prey -- it includes a
 n overview of the history and mechanics of hawk migration\, a tutorial on h
 awk identification\, and is a prelude to a special invitation to a hawk wat
 ch at Kiptopeke\, Virginia\, over the weekend of October 3-5.  (Kiptopeke i
 s the closest major hawk watch to North Carolina and one of the easiest in 
 the country to access.)\n \nPlease plan to join us for an exciting  talk ab
 out one of the most enigmatic groups of birds. Then mark your calendar for 
 a first-of-its-kind\, follow-up field trip.\n\nFor a trip itinerary and to 
 sign up\, visit:\nhttp://chbc.carolinanature.com/fieldtrips.html\n(click "i

 anback —The unusual reproductive biology of African hornbills\n \nAn unusua
 l breeding strategy – the sealing of the nest entrance – has multiple conse
 quences for hornbill birds.  As a result of the nest plug\, females must st
 ore male sperm and males must provision the female for the lengthy egg-layi
 ng\, incubation\, and chick-rearing stages.  Do males demand fidelity in ex
 change for their unparalleled degree of paternal investment?  To what exten
 t is female egg production determined by her mate’s food delivery? \n \nMar

DESCRIPTION:Leader Doug Shadwick writes:  The local lake levels have droppe
 d to a level where a few shorebirds\, etc. are stopping by on their souther
 n migration.  Thus\, field trips for the Chapel Hill Bird Club will begin. 
 We will concentrate on finding migrating shorebirds and other migrants.  Th
 e field trip may entail walking several miles over railroad beds\, stone em
 bankments\, fields of wet sedge and marsh grass and possibly soft mud and w
 ater.   Please dress appropriately with attention paid to spending several 
 hours in the sun and the possibility of tick and insect attacks.  This fiel
 d trip will be of longer duration than is typical - return to cars may be n
 oon or later.\n\nAs is usual for these field trips\, binoculars are a must 
 have and spotting scopes are highly desirable.  Photographic equipment is o
 ptional.  Also\, please plan to pack water and snacks for your self.  It wi
 ll almost surely be hot and humid as the morning progresses with little sha
 de relief on the lake banks and mudflats.\n\nThe local field trips will ori
 ginate in the Glen Lennox parking lot on highway 54 in Chapel Hill. We leav
 e the parking lot at 7:00 A.M..  For the Falls Lake field trips\, you can a
 lso meet us at the Hickory Hills boat ramps off of Redwood Road at about 7:
 30 A.M..  Please note that we will leave Glen Lennox at 7:00AM to try and a
 void the heat.\n\nDoug Shadwick (919-942-0479 or dougshadwick@nc.rr.com)\n

DESCRIPTION:Field Class in Little Brown Bird Identification\n\nIn this fiel
 d class we will concentrate on learning how to find and identify those ‘mic
 e’ of the avian world\, those LBJs\, those Little Brown Jobs—sparrows\, lar
 ks\, pipits\, and longspurs.  Birds in these groups can be difficult to ide
 ntify\, but the feeling of success is worth the challenge.  A number of the
 se species winter in eastern North Carolina fields and hedgerows\, and we w
 ill spend two days finding and studying them to learn their habits and fiel
 d marks.\n\nWe will provide some written materials\, but participants shoul
 d bring their own favorite field guides.  We will provide human leaders to 
 find the birds\, but participants should bring their own patience and perse
 verance.  We will provide spotting scopes\, but participants should bring t
 heir own binoculars (and scopes and cameras if they want to).\n\nAlthough w
 e will not avoid looking at other birds that cross our path\, our focus wil
 l be on the LBJs.  Join us.\n\nWhen: Saturday\, January 31 to Sunday\, Febr
 uary 1\, 2015\n\nCost: $20 donation to New Hope Audubon Society. Participan
 ts will also pay for their own food\, lodging\, and transportation.  The le
 aders will stay Saturday night at the Holiday Inn Express in Plymouth\, NC.
   You will need to make your own reservations.\n\nLocation: Various sites i
 n eastern North Carolina known for the presence of wintering sparrows and o
 ther little brown passerines (larks\, pipits\, longspurs\, etc.)\n\nLimit: 
 15\n\nContact:  Please respond to Norm Budnitz at: nbudnitz@gmail.com.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:\nHello My Dearest\, Please i need your help\n\n\nPlease permit
  me to introduce myself\, i am Miss Anisa Ibrahim Coulibaly 23 years old fe
 male from the Republic of Ivory Coast\, West Africa\, I'm the Daughter of L
 ate Chief Sgt. Ibrahim Coulibaly (a.k.a General IB ). My late Father was a 
 well known Ivory Coast military leader. He died on Thursday 28 April 2011 f
 ollowing a fight with the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast (FRCI).\n\nFor m
 ore details\, please contact me at anisaibrahim8@yahoo.com\n\n\nYou can rea
 d more about my father in the link below:\n\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/wo
 rld/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-renegade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly\n\n\nI am co
 nstrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which i am receiving f
 rom my step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury 
 and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father beca
 use my mother died during child birth and i was left alone with my step mot
 her to take care of me. Meanwhile i wanted to travel to Europe\, but she hi
 de away my traveling documents. Luckily she did not discover where i kept m
 y father's File which contained important documents like the will and depos
 it certificate of my Father's fund which bears my name as the next of kin t
 o inherit the money in his bank account. Now I am presently staying in the 
 Refugee Mission Camp in Burkina Faso. I am seeking for long term relationsh
 ip and investment assistance. My father of blessed memory deposited the sum
  of US$ 11.5 Million in Bank Of Africa here in Burkina Faso with my name as
  the next of kin.\n\n\nI have contacted the Bank to clear the deposit but t
 he Branch Manager told me that my late father place an instruction on the d
 eposited fund that i must present a foreign trustee who will help me in inv
 estment of the fund.\n\n\nHowever\, the manager advised me to provide a tru
 stee who will stand on my behalf for the transfer of the fund. i wanted to 
 inform my stepmother about this deposit but i am afraid that she will not o
 ffer me anything after the release of the money because she threaten to kil
 l me.\n\n\nTherefore\, i decide to seek for your help in transferring the m
 oney into your bank account while i will relocate to your country and settl
 e down with you. As you indicate your interest to help me\, i will give you
  the account number and the contact of the bank where my late beloved fathe
 r deposited the money with my name as the next of kin. It is my intention t
 o compensate you with 30% out of the total money after the transfer for you
 r assistance and the balance shall be my investment in any profitable ventu
 re which you will recommend to me as i have no idea about foreign investmen
 t. Please all my communications with you should be through email address fo
 r confidential purposes.\n\n\nFor more details\, please contact me at anisa
 ibrahim8@yahoo.com\n\n\nThanks in anticipation of your positive response.\n
 \n\nYours sincerely\nMiss Anisa Ibrahim Coulibaly.\n

DESCRIPTION:David Smith — Birds of New Zealand (and Tasmania)\nThe wildlife
  of New Zealand encompasses everything from fabulous endangered endemics to
  horribly misguided introduced species. Natural and un-natural selection ha
 ve led to a precarious balance\, but the country offers great opportunities
  to the traveling birder. David and Judy Smith will share photos and memori
 es of their trip to New Zealand and also to the Australian island-state of 
 Tasmania. Expect everything from Albatross to Wallaby\, with a couple of de
 vils thrown in.\n\nWe have monthly meetings from September through May. We 
 meet at 7:30 pm on the fourth Monday of the month at Binkley Baptist Church
 \, in the Lounge. Binkley is at 1712 Willow Drive in Chapel Hill\, at the i
 ntersection with 15-501 near University Mall (map with meeting room indicat
 ed by green arrow). Visitors welcome! Come at 7:15 for light refreshments. 
 No meeting in December.

  hard-to-reach beaver impoundments\, \nmudflats\, cattail marshes\, swamp c
 reeks\, and barrier islands.\nCanoes and kayaks also seem to fool many bird
 s into thinking\nwe are legless\, non-predatory creatures -- thereby allowi
 ng us a\nclose approach. Ginger Travis and Norm Budnitz have used a \ncanoe
  to look for King Rails at Jordan Lake (finding Anhingas\ninstead -- nice c
 onsolation prize!) and Piping Plovers at the\nRachel Carson Estuarine Reser
 ve off Beaufort (no plovers but \nnice-looking ponies). Ginger also has use
 d a kayak\nto monitor remote eagles' nests at Jordan Lake and to do \nsprin
 g bird counts. Ginger and Norm will show slides of\nsome of the interesting
  birds you might see from a canoe or\nkayak right here in the Triangle as w

 d Blackbirds\n\nDescription: Biologists used to think copulation was the fi
 nish line for an animal's reproductive success\, but we now know that sperm
  of different males often compete to fertilize a female's eggs. Advances in
  DNA sequencing mean we can examine this competition on the genetic level. 
 How does this post-mating competition drive the evolution of a species? Ire
 ne Liu studied the behavior and genes of three North American blackbird spe
 cies to answer this and other important questions.\n\nCome join us as Irene
  tells us stories about her field research into this fascinating subject. S
 he'll also show us video that demonstrates how she collected samples for fu
 rther study.\n\nLocation: Binkley Baptist Church\, 1712 Willow Dr.\, Chapel

DESCRIPTION:On 20 May 2019\, Neville Handel will speak to the Chapel Hill B
 ird Club on “Land Management at Mason Farm Biological Reserve: It’s not ‘fo
 r the birds’” during a presentation at Binkley Baptist Church (lounge). The
  church is at 1712 Willow Drive in Chapel Hill\, at the intersection with 1
 5-501 near University Mall. Visitors welcome! Come at 7:15 for light refres
 hments.\n\nMason Farm Biological Reserve and contiguous undeveloped tracts 
 create an approximately 900-acre natural area that connects with the 41\,00
 0-acre New Hope Game Lands to the south. It is owned and managed by the Nor
 th Carolina Botanical Garden (NCBG)\, is a popular destination for birders 
 in the Triangle Region. Maintaining it as a biological reserve supporting a
  wide range of habitats and high species diversity requires ecological know
 ledge\, extensive planning\, and a lot of labor. Neville Handel\, Land Mana
 ger for the NCBG\, oversees stewardship activities at Mason Farm and other 
 NCBG-managed reserves (including the Parker Preserve and Penny's Bend Natur
 e Preserve in Durham). In this talk\, Neville will describe his work in bot
 h the field and the office and discuss the considerations and planning that
  guide management of the reserve.

 ossible. Each of the citizen scientists who annually braves snow\, wind\, o
 r rain\, to take part in the Christmas Bird Count makes an enormous contrib
 ution to conservation. Audubon and other organizations use data collected i
 n this longest-running wildlife census to assess the health of bird populat
 ions - and to help guide conservation action. Beginners are welcome and wil
 l be paired with a more experienced birder. Binoculars are essential. Pre-r
 egistration is required. \nContact John Connors to be assigned a team/locat
 ion. jconnors@wakeaudubon.org\nYOUNG NATURALISTS have their own team. Conta

DESCRIPTION:Haven Wiley\, "The Triangle's Breeding Birds"  Dr. Haven Wiley 
 of the Biology Dept.\, UNC Chapel Hill\, will discuss the results of the Na
 tional Breeding Bird Survey (NBBS).   Although the NBBS monitors birds acro
 ss North America and has reported dramatic changes in populations of breedi
 ng birds in the past few decades\, are these changes also occurring in the 
 Triangle?  A decade of mini breeding bird surveys in Orange\, Chatham\, and
  Durham counties has obtained some answers and raised some new questions!\n

DESCRIPTION:Penny Padgett\, "Tick Talk: Everything you ever wanted to know 
 about ticks\, but were afraid to ask!"\n\nA vector-borne disease is one in 
 which the pathogenic microorganism is transmitted from an infected individu
 al to another individual by an arthropod or other agent\, sometimes with ot
 her animals serving as intermediary hosts. Nearly half of the world's popul
 ation is infected by vector-borne diseases\, resulting in high morbidity an
 d mortality. The most common vectors are ticks and mosquitoes.  Penny’s tal
 k will focus on tick vectors found in North Carolina and what diseases may 
 be transmitted by them.

DESCRIPTION:Leader Doug Shadwick writes:  The local lake levels have droppe
 d to a level where a few shorebirds\, etc. are stopping by on their souther
 n migration.  Thus\, field trips for the Chapel Hill Bird Club will begin. 
 We will concentrate on finding migrating shorebirds and other migrants.  Th
 e field trip may entail walking several miles over railroad beds\, stone em
 bankments\, fields of wet sedge and marsh grass and possibly soft mud and w
 ater.   Please dress appropriately with attention paid to spending several 
 hours in the sun and the possibility of tick and insect attacks.  This fiel
 d trip will be of longer duration than is typical - return to cars may be n
 oon or later.\n\nAs is usual for these field trips\, binoculars are a must 
 have and spotting scopes are highly desirable.  Photographic equipment is o
 ptional.  Also\, please plan to pack water and snacks for your self.  It wi
 ll almost surely be hot and humid as the morning progresses with little sha
 de relief on the lake banks and mudflats.\n\nThe local field trips will ori
 ginate in the Glen Lennox parking lot on highway 54 in Chapel Hill. We leav
 e the parking lot at 7:00 A.M..  For the Falls Lake field trips\, you can a
 lso meet us at the Hickory Hills boat ramps off of Redwood Road at about 7:
 30 A.M..  Please note that we will leave Glen Lennox at 7:00AM to try and a
 void the heat.\n\nDoug Shadwick (919-942-0479 or dougshadwick@nc.rr.com)\n

 t:</b> A <u>native plant</u> (only\, please!) exchange for those with too m

 /b> Gardeners are the best sources of plants and knowledge! Let’s get toget
 her and swap plants\, share advice\, and grow more native plants.<br><br><b
 >How:</b> Bring transplanted native plants in old nursery pots or bags that
  you are willing to part with. Folks who bring plants to “swap” will have a
 n opportunity to pick plants one at a time from the available selection. An
 y extra plants will be free to take for anyone who does not have plants to 
 donate. We will do our best to distribute plants evenly across attendees.<b
 r><br>When you dig a plant\, get as much root as possible as well as some o
 f the soil the plant is growing in. If you have clay\, you may want to supp
 lement with light potting soil or “soil conditioner” found where you buy ba
 gged garden soil. You can make an inexpensive potting mix with equal parts 
 compost and soil conditioner.<br><br>Once you dig a plant\, immediately put
  it in an individual pot and water it.<br><br>Keep transplanted plants in a
  shady spot and water as needed until the Plant Swap.<br><br>Before the swa
 p\, label each plant with the common and botanical name (if you know it) an
 d if it grows in the sun or shade. Any additional information would be an a
 ppreciated bonus! An easy way to label plants is with a marker on painter's
  tape or masking tape\, stuck to the pot or bag.<br><br>Consider bringing a
  small box\, bucket or wagon to transport plants home.<br><br><i>*Thanks to
  the Georgia Native Plant Society for the plant swap tips.</i>

 9\, 2014\nDescription:   Come learn about Wake Audubon Society's Bird of th
 e Year. Declines in Brown-Headed Nuthatch populations are often attributed 
 to habitat degradation\, but current research indicates that these nuthatch
 es are more ecologically flexible than we realized -- when they can avoid n
 est site competition with Eastern Bluebirds. Bluebird-proof nest boxes (add
  a device to keep the hole small) appear to be an effective way to enhance 
 nuthatch breeding success. We will have such boxes for sale. Refreshments w
 ill be served!\nSpeaker:  Mark Stanback\, Professor of Biology at Davidson 
 College\nWhere: NC Museum of Natural Sciences\, Main Building\, Level A Con
