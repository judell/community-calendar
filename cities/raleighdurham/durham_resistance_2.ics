DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy are partnering with Durham Dem
 ocrats to protest at the Tesla car dealership to stand up against Musk\, DO
 GE\, and our constitutional crisis. This is a nonpartisan event\, all are w
 elcome!\n\n\nThis will be a nonviolent protest in which we want to make our
  voices heard that we reject Musk and need him to go.\n\nWhy are our Senato
 rs Thom Tillis and Ted Budd ignoring the concerns of their constituents? Th
 ey MUST stand up for the constitution and our federal institutions. WE WILL
  BE PROTESTING WEEKLY until we receive a PUBLIC RESPONSE and CLEAR ACTION f
 rom Senators Tillis and Budd to oppose this administration&#39\;s unconstit
 utional actions.\n\n\nPlease bring signs both against Musk but also to enco
 urage people to get engaged and active in the fight. We need people to do m
 ore than honk their horn.\n\nOur message is also for Tillis and Budd to tak
 e a stand. And we need more than Democrats coming to these protests as many
  will be harmed by this administration. Please reach out to those you might
  not normally reach out to to find common ground.\n\nParking will be tight.
  We suggest carpooling. There is some parking on Grove Church Road and Barr
 owood. As a last resort\, we can try to park at nearby businesses.\n\nHow t
 o prepare:\nBe proud and say it loud. We did not elect Musk\, and he needs 
 to go as he continues to break the law and make decisions that benefit hims
 elf and hurt Americans. Bring signs. Bring friends. Let&#39\;s make our voi
 ces be heard!!\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mobiliz

 ange launched the Day Without Child Care (DWOCC)\, an annual day of action 
 designed to highlight the ongoing child care crisis and the urgent need for

 attention to these issues and advocate for change. On the Day Without Child

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy\n \nHello activism warriors!! 
 October 18th is the next national mobilization date. We will gather at the 
 Bull in Downtown Durham from 10:30-11:30. There will be thousands of demons
 trations and rallies planned nationwide. The theme is No Kings 2.0\, and we
  need this to be the biggest turnout so far!\n\nIn Durham\, early voting st
 arts October 16th. We will gather at the Bull for a small rally\, march\, a
 nd will spell the word "VOTE." Then\, we will all head to the polls to vote
  and take with us flyers to encourage others to vote early in the municipal
  elections.\n\nSigns matter! We need our signs to be positive and inclusive
 . We need them to be what we are for.\n\nWe care about the planet. We care 
 about due process. We care about housing for all. We care about healthcare 
 for all. We support peace. We support non-violence. We support our neighbor
 s.\n\nPlease subscribe to the Engaged Durhamites for Democracy Substack.\n\

 **In America\, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\n\nOur peaceful movem
 ent is only getting bigger and stronger. “NO KINGS” is more than just a slo
 gan—it’s the foundation our nation was built upon. Born in the streets\, ca
 rried by millions in chants and on posters\, it echoes from city blocks to 
 rural town squares\, uniting people across this country to fight dictatorsh
 ip together.\n\nThe president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America\,
  we don’t have kings\, and we won’t back down against chaos\, corruption\, 
 and cruelty. Grow our movement and join us.\n\n_A core principle behind all
  No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all partic
 ipants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who di
 sagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any 
 kind\, including those legally permitted\, should not be brought to events.
 _\n\nHow to prepare:\n📢 How to Prepare for Your Event:\n✅ Bring signs or p
 rops → Make your message visible! (Ideas: “NO KINGS IN AMERICA!”\, “THE PEO
 PLE UNITED”\, “NOT YOUR PIGGYBANK!”)\n✅ Recruit friends → The more people\,
  the more power.\n✅ Record everything → Post photos/videos with #NoKings\n\

DESCRIPTION:Durham For All\n \n(español abajo)\n\n**In Durham\, we believe 
 that _every_ child — no matter their race\, gender\, income\, or ability — 
 deserves a great education with the resources to thrive.** Public education
  is the foundation of strong communities and a healthy democracy. It’s wher
 e our children learn not just math and reading\, but how to think criticall
 y\, dream big\, and work together. But our public schools are under attack 
 from wealthy elites who are trying to dismantle public education for their 
 own profit and control. They funnel money away from our schools\, limit wha
 t our kids can learn\, and weaken the power of our public school system — a
 ll so students won’t grow up to challenge them. Still\, teachers\, school w
 orkers\, students and families show up every day\, pouring their hearts int
 o educating our children. **We must do everything we can to fight for our s
 chools and our students' right to a high quality education.**\n\nWe know wh
 at’s possible when we act together:\n\n* Students will get the education th
 ey need to succeed.\n\n* Teachers and staff will be supported and able to a
 fford their bills.\n\n* Parents will be able to trust that their children a
 re getting a strong education.\n\n* Our community will have the power to sh
 ape our future.\n\n**Join with other Durham Public Schools parents\, caregi
 vers and community supporters on 9/27 from 1-3pm at the Stanford L Warren L
 ibrary to discuss the top issues your students are facing and what's next i
 n the fight for our schools!**\n\n*Including caregivers\, guardians\, famil
 y memebers and community supporters\n\n**En Durham\, creemos que cada niño\
 , niña y niñe — sin importar su raza\, género\, clase o  capacidades\, mere
 ce tener una educación sólida con los recursos para alcanzar el éxito.** La
  educación pública es la base de comunidades fuertes y de una democracia sa
 ludable. Es donde nuestres niñes aprenden no solo matemáticas o lectura\, s
 ino también a desarrollar su pensamiento crítico\, trabajar en conjunto y s
 oñar en grande. \n\nPero nuestras escuelas están bajo el ataque de élites p
 oderosas que están tratando de desmantelar la educación pública para su pro
 pio beneficio y control. Extraen dinero de nuestras escuelas\, limitan lo q
 ue nuestros niños pueden aprender y debilitan el poder de nuestro sistema e
 ducativo\, y por lo tanto\, su capacidad para enfrentar esas injusticias en
  el futuro. Aún así\, profesores\, trabajadores escolares\, estudiantes y f
 amilias se presentan cada día\, entregan su corazón a la educación de nuest
 res hijes. **Debemos hacer todo lo que podamos para luchar por el derecho a
  educación de alta calidad para nuestros estudiantes en sus escuelas.**\n\n
 Sabemos qué es posible cuando actuamos en conjunto:\n\n* Les estudiantes te
 ndrán la educación necesaria para alcanzar el éxito.\n* Profesores y trabaj
 adores de la escuela serán apoyados y serán capaces de pagar sus cuentas.\n
 * Las familias podrán confiar en que sus hijes están teniendo acceso a una 
 educación sólida e integral.\n* Nuestra comunidad tendrá el poder de moldea
 r el futuro.\n\n**Acompáñanos con otros padres* de escuelas públicas de Dur
 ham el 27 de Septiembre de 1 a 3 pm en Stanford L Warren Library para discu
 tir sobre los principales problemas que enfrentan sus estudiantes y cuáles 
 son los siguientes pasos en la lucha por nuestras escuelas!** Habrá cuidado
  de niñes e interpretación entre Español e Inglés!\n\n*Incluyendo familiare
 s\, guardianes\, cuidadores y miembros de la comunidad.\n\nhttps://www.mobi

DESCRIPTION:We are excited that plans have firmed up for the next mass mobi
 lization on Saturday August 2nd at 10am. \n\nPEOPLE FOR DEMOCRACY: Rage Aga
 inst the Regime\n\n🗓️Saturday\, August 2\, 2025\n⏰10:00 AM – 12:00 PM\n📍H
 alifax Mall\, Raleigh\, NC\n300 N Salisbury St Raleigh\, NC 27603\n\nJoin u
 s this August 2nd for People for Democracy: Rage Against the Regime\, as we
  take to the streets to march—harnessing the energy of collective resistanc
 e to demand a just\, inclusive\, and representative democracy in North Caro
 lina and beyond.\n\nWhy We’re Demonstrating: We demand an end to the politi
 cal extremism &amp\; blatant voter suppression in North Carolina\, the depl
 oyment of ICE in our communities &amp\; construction of concentration camps
 \, the lack of gun control to protect our citizens\, the attacks on LGBTQIA
 + &amp\; reproductive rights\, the destruction of the pillars that support 
 our democracy and the three branches of government\, and the dismantling of
  our fundamental rights &amp\; K-12 education system.\n\nEvent Overview:\nT
 he event is part of the mass mobilization and has two parts. First\, the ra
 lly begins at 10:00am at Halifax Mall in Raleigh. It is sponsored by Planne
 d Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic\, Common Cause NC\, Deiter Mediation\, 5
 0501 NC\, Raleigh Boots on the Ground\, and Poor People’s Campaign.\n\nSeco
 nd\, at around 10:30am\, the rally will transition into a march as protecto
 rs form a Human Chain. Our coalition partners\, Engaged Durhamites for Demo
 cracy\, 50501 NC\, Democracy Out Loud!\, Wake Women Have Mercy\, and Indivi
 sible Orange County\, will lead a powerful Human Chain that starts at Halif
 ax Mall and stretches out on sidewalks. We have mapped out a 2-mile path th
 at circles the Federal Court building to show our solidarity with our feder
 al judges as they defend our constitution and fight back against tyranny.\n
 \nForming this Human Chain is a bold act of solidarity. We are upping our g
 ame from simply marching to showing unity with a bond that cannot be broken
  by the lawlessness of this regime.\n\nLocking hands with others demonstrat
 es our shared commitment to protecting our neighbors\, our values\, and our
  democracy.\n\nThis is the first time that Raleigh\, Durham\, Chapel Hill\,
  and beyond have combined their rallies into a unified event. There is powe
 r in our numbers and power in our unbreakable chain. All normal Saturday de
 monstrations will be canceled so folks can head to Raleigh to make a HUGE H
 UMAN CHAIN!\n\nEveryone is welcome.\nThis is a peaceful\, family-friendly\,
  and nonviolent event. We call on all of our participants to act with respe
 ct\, seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation\, and come in the spir
 it of unity and love.\n\nNow is the time to show that we the people are awa
 ke\, organized\, and committed to building a democracy that works for all.\

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy are partnering with Durham Dem
 ocrats to protest at the Tesla car dealership to stand up against Musk\, DO
 GE\, and our constitutional crisis. This is a nonpartisan event\, all are w
 elcome!\n\n\nThis will be a nonviolent protest in which we want to make our
  voices heard that we reject Musk and need him to go.\n\nWhy are our Senato
 rs Thom Tillis and Ted Budd ignoring the concerns of their constituents? Th
 ey MUST stand up for the constitution and our federal institutions. WE WILL
  BE PROTESTING WEEKLY until we receive a PUBLIC RESPONSE and CLEAR ACTION f
 rom Senators Tillis and Budd to oppose this administration&#39\;s unconstit
 utional actions.\n\n\nPlease bring signs both against Musk but also to enco
 urage people to get engaged and active in the fight. We need people to do m
 ore than honk their horn.\n\nOur message is also for Tillis and Budd to tak
 e a stand. And we need more than Democrats coming to these protests as many
  will be harmed by this administration. Please reach out to those you might
  not normally reach out to to find common ground.\n\nParking will be tight.
  We suggest carpooling. There is some parking on Grove Church Road and Barr
 owood. As a last resort\, we can try to park at nearby businesses.\n\nHow t
 o prepare:\nBe proud and say it loud. We did not elect Musk\, and he needs 
 to go as he continues to break the law and make decisions that benefit hims

DESCRIPTION:(español a continuación)\n\n**In Durham\, we believe that _ever
 y_ child — no matter their race\, gender\, income\, or ability — deserves a
  great education with the resources to thrive.** Public education is the fo
 undation of strong communities and a healthy democracy. It’s where our chil
 dren learn not just math and reading\, but how to think critically\, dream 
 big\, and work together. But our public schools are under attack from wealt
 hy elites who are trying to dismantle public education for their own profit
  and control. They funnel money away from our schools\, limit what our kids
  can learn\, and weaken the power of our public school system — all so stud
 ents won’t grow up to challenge them. Still\, teachers\, school workers\, s
 tudents and families show up every day\, pouring their hearts into educatin
 g our children. **We must do everything we can to fight for our schools and
  our students&#39\; right to a high quality education.**\n\nWe know what’s 
 possible when we act together:\n\n* Students will get the education they ne
 ed to succeed.\n\n* Teachers and staff will be supported and able to afford
  their bills.\n\n* Parents will be able to trust that their children are ge
 tting a strong education.\n\n* Our community will have the power to shape o
 ur future.\n\n**Join with other Durham Public Schools parents*\, caregivers
  and community supporters on 11/01 from 1-3pm at the Stanford L Warren Libr
 ary to discuss the top issues your students are facing and what&#39\;s next
  in the fight for our schools!**\n\n*Including caregivers\, guardians\, fam
 ily members and community supporters\n\n**En Durham\, creemos que cada niño
 \, niña y niñe — sin importar su raza\, género\, clase o  capacidades\, mer
 ece tener una educación sólida con los recursos para alcanzar el éxito.** L
 a educación pública es la base de comunidades fuertes y de una democracia s
 aludable. Es donde nuestres niñes aprenden no solo matemáticas o lectura\, 
 sino también a desarrollar su pensamiento crítico\, trabajar en conjunto y 
 soñar en grande. \n\nPero nuestras escuelas están bajo el ataque de élites 
 poderosas que están tratando de desmantelar la educación pública para su pr
 opio beneficio y control. Extraen dinero de nuestras escuelas\, limitan lo 
 que nuestros niños pueden aprender y debilitan el poder de nuestro sistema 
 educativo\, y por lo tanto\, su capacidad para enfrentar esas injusticias e
 n el futuro. Aún así\, profesores\, trabajadores escolares\, estudiantes y 
 familias se presentan cada día\, entregan su corazón a la educación de nues
 tres hijes. **Debemos hacer todo lo que podamos para luchar por el derecho 
 a educación de alta calidad para nuestros estudiantes en sus escuelas.**\n\
 nSabemos qué es posible cuando actuamos en conjunto:\n\n* Les estudiantes t
 endrán la educación necesaria para alcanzar el éxito.\n* Profesores y traba
 jadores de la escuela serán apoyados y serán capaces de pagar sus cuentas.\
 n* Las familias podrán confiar en que sus hijes están teniendo acceso a una
  educación sólida e integral.\n* Nuestra comunidad tendrá el poder de molde
 ar el futuro.\n\n**Acompáñanos con otros padres* de escuelas públicas de Du
 rham el 11 de Noviembre de 1 a 3 pm en Stanford L Warren Library para discu
 tir sobre los principales problemas que enfrentan sus estudiantes y cuáles 
 son los siguientes pasos en la lucha por nuestras escuelas!** Habrá cuidado
  de niñes e interpretación entre Español e Inglés!\n\n*Incluyendo familiare
 s\, guardianes\, cuidadores y miembros de la comunidad.\n\n<a href="https:/

DESCRIPTION:Join us this August 2nd for People for Democracy: Rage Against 
 the Regime\, as we take to the streets to march\, harnessing the energy of 
 collective resistance to demand a just\, inclusive\, and representative dem
 ocracy in North Carolina and beyond by FORMING A HUMAN CHAIN!\n\n🗓️Saturda
 y\, August 2\, 2025 ⏰10:00 AM – 12:00 PM 📍Halifax Mall\, Raleigh\, NC 300 
 N Salisbury St Raleigh\, NC 27603  <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=ht

 OvVaw3aa0ZMF8R6XTXDpbwX213u" target="_blank">linktr.ee/50501NC</a>\n\nWhy W
 e’re Protesting: We demand an end to the political extremism &amp\; blatant
  voter suppression in North Carolina\, the deployment of ICE in our communi
 ties &amp\; construction of concentration camps\, the lack of gun control t
 o protect our citizens\, the attacks on LGBTQIA+ &amp\; reproductive rights
 \, the destruction of the pillars that support our democracy and the three 
 branches of government\, and the dismantling of our fundamental rights &amp
 \; K-12 education system. \n\nEvent Overview: The event is part of the mass
  mobilization and has two parts. First\, the rally begins at 10:00 AM at Ha
 lifax Mall in Raleigh. It is sponsored by Planned Parenthood Votes! South A
 tlantic\, Common Cause NC\, Deiter Mediation\, 50501 NC\, and Raleigh Boots
  on the Ground.\n\nSecond\, the rally will transition into a march as prote
 ctors form a Human Chain. Our coalition partners\, Engaged Durhamites for D
 emocracy\, 50501 NC\, Democracy Out Loud!\, Wake Women Have Mercy\, and Ind
 ivisible Orange County.\, will lead a powerful Human Chain that starts at H
 alifax Mall and stretches out on sidewalks.\n\nForming this Human Chain is 
 a bold act of solidarity. We are upping our game from simply marching to sh
 owing unity with a bond that cannot be broken by the lawlessness of this re
 gime. Locking hands with others demonstrates our shared commitment to prote
 cting our neighbors\, our values\, and our democracy.\n\nThis is the first 
 time that Raleigh\, Durham\, Chapel Hill\, and beyond have combined their r
 allies into a unified event. There is power in our numbers and power in our
  unbreakable chain.\n\nEveryone is welcome. This is a peaceful\, family-fri
 endly\, and nonviolent event. We call on all of our participants to act wit
 h respect\, seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation\, and come in t
 he spirit of unity and love. \n\nDo you want to carpool? Send the organizer
 \, Sylvia Dickens\, an email.\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http

DESCRIPTION:The Durham Democrats are hosting a Winter Food Drive. Our first
  successful drive in November gathered over 7 tons of food for local pantri
 es. However\, after the holidays\, donations to pantries are at their annua
 l low. Hunger is forgotten. The need continues to be acute especially in li
 ght of rising grocery prices.\n\nWe will be collecting between February 14 
 and 27.  You may reach out to your Precinct Chair to find out where they ar
 e collecting in your neighborhood. Or run your own collection by contacting
  your friends and neighbors to let them know about this easy way to give ba
 ck to our community.\n\nWe will be sharing our bounty with: Iglesia Emanuel
  Food Pantry\, Parktown Food Hub\, USSW Food Pantry (United Southern Servic
 e Workers) and the Walltown Food Pantry\n\nHere is what we need: Non-perish
 able CANNED and BOXED food (NO GLASS CONTAINERS\, PLEASE)\, feminine and pe
 rsonal products. Grocery store gift cards are also a great way to participa
 te. This allows the food pantries to fill in their shelves where needed.\n\
 nSome suggestions are: good protein sources-peanut butter\, canned chicken 
 and tuna\, protein bars\, mac &amp\; cheese and soup\, cereal\, canned vege
 tables\, canned fruit (low sugar)\, pasta\, sauce (canned) and beans.\n\nPl
 ease do not donate anything past its expiration date and focus on low sugar
  and sodium products.\n\nIn closing\, to participate:\n\n- reach out to you
 r Precinct Chair to donate between Feb. 14-27. (Let us know if you don&#39\
 ;t know who that is. We can point you in the right direction.)\n\n- If your
  precinct is not actively participating\, let us know that too. We have a l
 ist of places that will accept donation during the drive.\n\n- OR bring you
 r donation directly to the sorting location on February 28 BY 12 NOON  to 1
 737 Hillandale Road in Durham (St. Luke&#39\;s Episcopal Church). \n\n- If 
 you would like to participate but none of the above work for you\, let us k
 now. We can work with you.\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https:/

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy\n \nThe government is shut dow
 n because the big bad bill takes health care away from many and will raise 
 the cost of health care for many more. We need those elements removed.\n\nW
 e also oppose the policies that cut vaccines\, climate change\, SNAP\, USAI
 D\, and more. We care about people and want to prevent death.\n\nWe will no
 t stand by and let there be a fascist take over of our country. We Resist F
 ascism and will not let democracy die on our watch!\n\nOn November 2nd from
  12-2\, we will have a nonviolent long march to spread the word about the f
 ascism that has overtaken our government and the deaths that this administr
 ation has already caused and might cause in the future. \n\nNov 2nd is the 
 end of Daylight Savings\, so please move your clocks back an hour.\n\nWe as
 k all attendees dress all in black. We will have a sign-making party to mak
 e the signs that will all be on black backgrounds with white lettering. \n\
 nWe will start at the Bull in Downtown Durham. We will march single file\, 
 spaced out holding our signs about the elements of fascism that currently e
 xist. We will march down to the DPAC as people arrive for their 1pm show. T
 hen\, we will march up to Durham Central Park where there is a food truck r
 odeo. This is a visibility event. This is a solemn event\, not one where we
  are cheering and chanting and looking for honks. This is an education even
 t. \n\nPeople do not need to do the whole long march that is about 2.5 mile
 s. They can be at the Bull when people return from the DPAC to take the nex
 t leg up to Central Park. \n\nWhen the march is over\, we will gather at th
 e Bull for a "die in" where we will represent the deaths that will happen w
 ith the cuts and policies of this regime.\n\nPARKING:\n\n***Chapel Hill Str
 eet Parking Garage 326 E Chapel Hill St\, Durham\, NC 27701\n\n***Corcoran 
 Street Parking Garage 110 Corcoran St\, Durham\, NC 27701\n\n***Durham Cent

 ewalks with normal curb ramps.\n\n***Expect large crowds. No seating. Get t
 here early to find a place on the plaza to be and bring your own chair if n

 EITHER 7:30-9 AM OR 4:30–6:00 PM at the corner of Franklin St &amp\; Elliot
 t Rd in Chapel Hill for a weekly\, peaceful\, nonpartisan protest and call 
 to action. Free parking at the Church of Reconciliation\, 110 N Elliott Rd.
 \n\nAcross the political spectrum\, Americans are disillusioned by leaders 
 who put power over people. We gather to build community\, spark hope\, and 
 inspire action.\n\nBring a friend. Bring a sign. Speak up for immigrant rig
 hts\, free speech\, healthcare\, social security\, the environment\, the Co
 nstitution and the rule of law\, reproductive freedom\, job and funding cut
 s\, and the many\, many other issues close to our hearts. Bonus points for 
 signs that encourage others to move beyond honking and help turn awareness 
 into action.\n\n\n*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a comm
 itment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escal
 ate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n

DESCRIPTION:The SAVE Act is a Republican bill currently working its way thr
 ough Congress that would require all US voters to register using their pass
 port or birth certificate (and if your name has changed because of marriage
  or another reason a birth certificate will not suffice.) It would disenfra
 nchise at least half of American voters. We&#39\;re going door to door to a
 sk voters to call Senator Thom Tillis to tell him to vote no on this attack
  on the right to vote.\n\nLots of people make the call! It&#39\;s works and

 ver and bills to pay. We need Duke to stand with us and fight back. </p><p>
 On Founders’ Day 2025\, we are calling on Duke University to show bold lead
 ership by protecting higher education and raising standards across the regi
 on through good\, union jobs and giving back to the community that makes Du
 ke run by investing in our public schools\, affordable housing\, and city i
 nfrastructure.<br><br>As the largest employer in Durham\, Duke has a respon

DESCRIPTION:Join us on the first Sunday of the month as we do a coordinated
  demonstration on multiple corners (Feb 1 is just for colleges and has its 
 own link). All events are from 1pm-2:30pm as we host “Cultivating Courage b
 y Covering Corners\,” a peaceful visibility event designed to build courage
  and unity in support of democracy. \n\nPlease sign up for your corner on S
 ignUp Genius:  \n\nSmall groups will gather on consecutive corners along a 
 key stretch of road\, holding positive\, pro-democracy signs. We will cover
  corners in areas where ED4D does typically do not demonstrate: Creedmoor\,
  Holly Springs\, and XXX. All of these areas are purple. \n\nThe purpose is
  to build motivation for folks to join us. By standing together on multiple
  corners simultaneously\, we show our community that courage is contagious—
 that even small acts of presence can inspire others to stand up for shared 
 values.\n\nEach participant plays an essential role: being visible\, being 
 brave\, and encouraging others to do the same. The goal is to create a ripp
 le of courage that spreads across our community and beyond.\n\nWe will have
  one common sign at each corner. People will need to bring their own signs.
  Please also consider bring an American flag along with one of several othe
 r flags (rainbow flag\, Palestine flag\, Mexican flag\, Ukraine flag)\, to 
 make it clear we are not MAGA. We have rainbow flags for each corner. \n\nP
 lease make signs that say\, “Stand up\, you are not alone!” “Resist!” “Cour
 age is contagious!” &quot\;Call your elected officials&quot\; &quot\;Vote&q
 uot\; &quot\;We the People Have Power!&quot\; &quot\;Start your own demonst

DESCRIPTION:The SAVE Act is a Republican bill currently working its way thr
 ough Congress that would require all US voters to register using their pass
 port or birth certificate (and if your name has changed because of marriage
  or another reason a birth certificate will not suffice.) It would disenfra
 nchise at least half of American voters. We&#39\;re going door to door to a

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy are partnering with Durham Dem
 ocrats to protest at the Tesla car dealership to stand up against Musk\, DO
 GE\, and our constitutional crisis. This is a nonpartisan event\, all are w
 elcome!\n\n\nThis will be a nonviolent protest in which we want to make our
  voices heard that we reject Musk and need him to go.\n\nWhy are our Senato
 rs Thom Tillis and Ted Budd ignoring the concerns of their constituents? Th
 ey MUST stand up for the constitution and our federal institutions. WE WILL
  BE PROTESTING WEEKLY until we receive a PUBLIC RESPONSE and CLEAR ACTION f
 rom Senators Tillis and Budd to oppose this administration&#39\;s unconstit
 utional actions.\n\n\nPlease bring signs both against Musk but also to enco
 urage people to get engaged and active in the fight. We need people to do m
 ore than honk their horn.\n\nOur message is also for Tillis and Budd to tak
 e a stand. And we need more than Democrats coming to these protests as many
  will be harmed by this administration. Please reach out to those you might
  not normally reach out to to find common ground.\n\nParking will be tight.
  We suggest carpooling. There is some parking on Grove Church Road and Barr
 owood. As a last resort\, we can try to park at nearby businesses.\n\nHow t
 o prepare:\nBe proud and say it loud. We did not elect Musk\, and he needs 
 to go as he continues to break the law and make decisions that benefit hims

  two purposes. The first is to promote engagement among college students to
  exercise their civic rights to demonstrate\, contact their elected officia

 ically in NC\, we want to educate students as voting rights are being curta
 iled\, specifically by eliminating some early voting locations that were on
  college campuses. \n\nThe second purpose is to register students to vote. 
 Anyone wanting to help register students needs to be trained. YouCanVote ha

 our planet” “Affordability matters” and “Stop Gaza genocide.”\n\nWe ask adu
 lts to bring extra signs in case some of the students do not have them.\n\n
 Please spread the word to any college student you know to see if they might
  organize this event at their college.\n\nEach participant plays an essenti

DESCRIPTION:Join us on the first Sunday of the month as we do a coordinated
  demonstration on multiple corners (Feb 1 is just for colleges and has its 
 own link). All events are from 1pm-2:30pm as we host “Cultivating Courage b
 y Covering Corners\,” a peaceful visibility event designed to build courage
  and unity in support of democracy. \n\nPlease sign up for your corner on S
 ignUp Genius:  \n\nSmall groups will gather on consecutive corners along a 
 key stretch of road\, holding positive\, pro-democracy signs. We will cover
  corners in areas where ED4D does typically do not demonstrate: Creedmoor\,
  Holly Springs\, and XXX. All of these areas are purple. \n\nThe purpose is
  to build motivation for folks to join us. By standing together on multiple
  corners simultaneously\, we show our community that courage is contagious—
 that even small acts of presence can inspire others to stand up for shared 
 values.\n\nEach participant plays an essential role: being visible\, being 
 brave\, and encouraging others to do the same. The goal is to create a ripp
 le of courage that spreads across our community and beyond.\n\nWe will have
  one common sign at each corner. People will need to bring their own signs.
  Please also consider bring an American flag along with one of several othe
 r flags (rainbow flag\, Palestine flag\, Mexican flag\, Ukraine flag)\, to 
 make it clear we are not MAGA. We have rainbow flags for each corner. \n\nP
 lease make signs that say\, “Stand up\, you are not alone!” “Resist!” “Cour
 age is contagious!” &quot\;Call your elected officials&quot\; &quot\;Vote&q
 uot\; &quot\;We the People Have Power!&quot\; &quot\;Start your own demonst

DESCRIPTION:NC Democrats\n \nThe North Carolina General Assembly has failed
  in its constitutional duty to pass a state budget. As of November\, our co
 mmunities\, institutions\, and families are experiencing the real-world con
 sequences of that failure. \n\nOn Wednesday\, members of the NC Senate Demo
 cratic Caucus will host a public hearing at the General Assembly to spotlig
 ht the real-world consequences of the legislature’s ongoing failure to pass
  a state budget.\n\nThe hearing\, titled “The Real-World Impact of Failing 
 to Pass a State\nBudget\,” will take place from 1:00 to 3:00 PM in the NCGA
  Auditorium and is open to the press and public.\n\nThis hearing will give 
 voice to those being harmed and make clear that Senate Democrats are showin
 g up\, listening\, and pushing for solutions\, even as our Republican colle
 agues continue to hide\, delay and disengage.\n\nLet’s fill every seat and 
 remind our elected officials who they serve!\n\nHow to prepare:\nAs you arr
 ive\, we will be in the Auditorium -- which is on the 3rd floor of the buil
 ding just off the atrium\, when you arrive\, Dorian Palmer\, NCDP Director 
 of Coalitions and Community Engagement will meet you in the atriumm and shu
 ffle you into the room.\n\nIf you have any questions\, do not hesitate to r

DESCRIPTION:<p>Now more than ever\, Durham must unite together to fight bac
 k against attacks\, and to fight for a future that uplifts all of us.</p><p
 >Duke is an anchor of our community and our state\, and we are calling on i
 t to lead. We show up for Duke\, and now it’s time for Duke to show up for 
 us. In Durham\, we see Duke in every corner of the city. We show up to work
  at Duke’s facilities across the city\; we care for patients at Duke Hospit
 al\; we study and teach in Duke’s classrooms. Duke has continued to grow an
 d profit\, but working people in Durham aren’t keeping up.</p><p>Now\, in t
 his crisis moment\, Duke has an opportunity to lead. It must stand up to at
 tacks from Trump\, Musk and the other billionaires who control the federal 
 government. And it must address the roots of the crisis we are in\, by usin
 g its immense resources to help ensure a brighter future for working people
  in Durham. </p><p>Duke has a nearly $12 billion endowment. An endowment th
 at big shouldn’t be sitting in a bank account\, or used solely to accumulat
 e more wealth. Now is the time for Duke to do more\, not less. </p><p>We di
 dn’t get to this crisis moment overnight. For decades\, corporations and po
 liticians have worked together to weaken our unions\, suppress our wages\, 
 and disinvest in public infrastructure — all while instituting a gerrymande
 ring scheme that has diluted the voices of working people in favor of corpo
 rate interests. They’ve ignored the cost crisis that keeps working families
  up at night. And this year\, extreme politicians and unelected billionaire
 s have launched a vicious attack on our universities\, our unions\, and hea
 lth care for veterans and other essential public services — all to fund mor
 e tax cuts for the rich.</p><p>It’s clear the solutions we need right now w
 on’t come from Washington DC or even from Raleigh. Here in Durham\, we know
  we have to start by looking at what’s right in front of us. </p><p>Workers
  and community members from across a broad cross section of Durham are comi
 ng together to demand that Duke step up and show up for the community that 
 has made it so successful. Our vision of Durham can only be realized if Duk
 e sets a model standard for other employers to follow\, pays its fair share
  to support local public schools and infrastructure\, helps  alleviate the 
 dire crises of housing insecurity in Durham\, and stands up to unprecedente
 d attacks from Washington DC.</p><p>Duke: don’t sell out your students\, yo
 ur staff and the community that has made you successful.</p><p>Workers\, st
 udents and community members are standing up against Trump and Musk\, and i
 t’s your responsibility to follow our lead. It’s time for Duke to be bold a
 nd do more.</p><p><strong>Join us on Wednesday\, May 7th at 6pm for our pub

  fellow Durhamites in the next mass mobilization to defend our rights and f
 reedom. We need to keep our movement growing to show our elected officials 
 we are not okay with what is happening in our country. We need to fight for
  our democracy and protect our neighbors Bring friends!\n\nIn honor of John
  Lewis\, we will focus on voting rights and voter registration.\n\nGood Tro
 uble Lives On is a national day of nonviolent action to respond to the atta
 cks posed on our civil and human rights by the Trump administration and to 
 remind them that in America\, the power lies with the people.\n\nOn July 17
 \, the anniversary of Congressman John Lewis’s passing\, we’re taking actio
 n across the country to defend our democracy and carry forward his legacy o
 f Good Trouble.\n\nFrom voter suppression bills like the SAVE Act to the cr
 iminalization of protest\, the Trump administration is launching a full-sca
 le attack on our civil and human rights. But we know the truth: in America\
 , the power lies with the people\, and we’re rising to prove it.\n\nThis is
  more than a protest\; it’s a moral reckoning. A continuation of the moveme
 nt Lewis helped lead\, and a new front in the struggle for freedom.\n\nPlea
 se note: A core principle behind our Good Trouble Lives On actions is a com
 mitment to nonviolence in all we do. We expect all participants to seek to 
 de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our va
 lues.\n\nPARKING:\n\n***Chapel Hill Street Parking Garage 326 E Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:The SAVE Act is a Republican bill currently working its way thr
 ough Congress that would require all US voters to register using their pass
 port or birth certificate (and if your name has changed because of marriage
  or another reason a birth certificate will not suffice.) It would disenfra
 nchise at least half of American voters. We&#39\;re going door to door to a
 sk voters to call Senator Thom Tillis to tell him to vote no on this attack
  on the right to vote.\n\nLots of people make the call! It&#39\;s works and

DESCRIPTION:Please join Engaged Defenders for Democracy on Sunday\, Februar
 y 1st from 1pm-2:30pm as we host “Cultivating Courage on College Cuads” a p
 eaceful visibility event designed to build courage and unity among college 
 students in support of democracy. \n\nWe are commemorating the Feb 1st Sit-
 In at Woolworths in 1960 led by college students at North Carolina A&amp\;T
  College. We need more college students joining our current movement.\n\nTh
 e visibility event has two purposes. The first is to promote engagement amo
 ng college students to exercise their civic rights to demonstrate\, contact
  their elected officials\, and learn more about what his happening in this 
 country. Also\, specifically in NC\, we wan to educate students as voting r
 ights are being curtailed\, specifically by eliminating some early voting l
 ocations that were on college campuses. \n\nThe second purpose is to regist
 er students to vote. Anyone wanting to help register students needs to be t
 rained. YouCanVote has 30-minute virtual trainings. \n\n<a href="https://ww

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy are partnering with Durham Dem
 ocrats to protest at the Tesla car dealership to stand up against Musk\, DO
 GE\, and our constitutional crisis. This is a nonpartisan event\, all are w
 elcome!\n\n\nThis will be a nonviolent protest in which we want to make our
  voices heard that we reject Musk and need him to go.\n\nWhy are our Senato
 rs Thom Tillis and Ted Budd ignoring the concerns of their constituents? Th
 ey MUST stand up for the constitution and our federal institutions. WE WILL
  BE PROTESTING WEEKLY until we receive a PUBLIC RESPONSE and CLEAR ACTION f
 rom Senators Tillis and Budd to oppose this administration&#39\;s unconstit
 utional actions.\n\n\nPlease bring signs both against Musk but also to enco
 urage people to get engaged and active in the fight. We need people to do m
 ore than honk their horn.\n\nOur message is also for Tillis and Budd to tak
 e a stand. And we need more than Democrats coming to these protests as many
  will be harmed by this administration. Please reach out to those you might
  not normally reach out to to find common ground.\n\nParking will be tight.
  We suggest carpooling. There is some parking on Grove Church Road and Barr
 owood. As a last resort\, we can try to park at nearby businesses.\n\nHow t
 o prepare:\nBe proud and say it loud. We did not elect Musk\, and he needs 
 to go as he continues to break the law and make decisions that benefit hims
 elf and hurt Americans. Bring signs. Bring friends. Let&#39\;s make our voi
 ces be heard!!\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mobiliz

DESCRIPTION:Carolina Federation\n \n(español abajo)\n\n**In Durham\, we bel
 ieve that _every_ child — no matter their race\, gender\, income\, or abili
 ty — deserves a great education with the resources to thrive.** Public educ
 ation is the foundation of strong communities and a healthy democracy. It’s
  where our children learn not just math and reading\, but how to think crit
 ically\, dream big\, and work together. But our public schools are under at
 tack from wealthy elites who are trying to dismantle public education for t
 heir own profit and control. They funnel money away from our schools\, limi
 t what our kids can learn\, and weaken the power of our public school syste
 m — all so students won’t grow up to challenge them. Still\, teachers\, sch
 ool workers\, students and families show up every day\, pouring their heart
 s into educating our children. **We must do everything we can to fight for 
 our schools and our students' right to a high quality education.**\n\nWe kn
 ow what’s possible when we act together:\n\n* Students will get the educati
 on they need to succeed.\n\n* Teachers and staff will be supported and able
  to afford their bills.\n\n* Parents will be able to trust that their child
 ren are getting a strong education.\n\n* Our community will have the power 
 to shape our future.\n\n**Join with other Durham Public Schools parents\, c
 aregivers and community supporters on 10/18 from 1-3pm at the Stanford L Wa
 rren Library to discuss the top issues your students are facing and what's 
 next in the fight for our schools!**\n\n*Including caregivers\, guardians\,
  family memebers and community supporters\n\n**En Durham\, creemos que cada
  niño\, niña y niñe — sin importar su raza\, género\, clase o  capacidades\
 , merece tener una educación sólida con los recursos para alcanzar el éxito
 .** La educación pública es la base de comunidades fuertes y de una democra
 cia saludable. Es donde nuestres niñes aprenden no solo matemáticas o lectu
 ra\, sino también a desarrollar su pensamiento crítico\, trabajar en conjun
 to y soñar en grande. \n\nPero nuestras escuelas están bajo el ataque de él
 ites poderosas que están tratando de desmantelar la educación pública para 
 su propio beneficio y control. Extraen dinero de nuestras escuelas\, limita
 n lo que nuestros niños pueden aprender y debilitan el poder de nuestro sis
 tema educativo\, y por lo tanto\, su capacidad para enfrentar esas injustic
 ias en el futuro. Aún así\, profesores\, trabajadores escolares\, estudiant
 es y familias se presentan cada día\, entregan su corazón a la educación de
  nuestres hijes. **Debemos hacer todo lo que podamos para luchar por el der
 echo a educación de alta calidad para nuestros estudiantes en sus escuelas.
 **\n\nSabemos qué es posible cuando actuamos en conjunto:\n\n* Les estudian
 tes tendrán la educación necesaria para alcanzar el éxito.\n* Profesores y 
 trabajadores de la escuela serán apoyados y serán capaces de pagar sus cuen
 tas.\n* Las familias podrán confiar en que sus hijes están teniendo acceso 
 a una educación sólida e integral.\n* Nuestra comunidad tendrá el poder de 
 moldear el futuro.\n\n**Acompáñanos con otros padres* de escuelas públicas 
 de Durham el 10 de Octubre de 1 a 3 pm en Stanford L Warren Library para di
 scutir sobre los principales problemas que enfrentan sus estudiantes y cuál
 es son los siguientes pasos en la lucha por nuestras escuelas!** Habrá cuid
 ado de niñes e interpretación entre Español e Inglés!\n\n*Incluyendo famili
 ares\, guardianes\, cuidadores y miembros de la comunidad.\n\nhttps://www.m

 velling from Durham\, you can ride the bus or join the caravan departing at
  3:00 PM from the Union of Southern Service  Workers office\, 2634 Durham-C
 hapel Hill Blvd. Durham\, NC 27707. Arrive at 2pm for food and fellowship! 
 Transportation will be provided.\n\n****\n\nAcross the country—from fruit f
 ields in California to classrooms in Chicago\, from kitchens in Queens to l
 oading docks in Charleston—working people are rising up. **We are demanding
  a country that puts our families over their fortunes**—public schools over
  private profits\, healthcare over hedge funds\, housing over homelessness.
 \n\nMusk\, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to create a race to
  the bottom—on wages\, on benefits\, on dignity itself. They want to erase 
 labor rights\, break our unions\, and silence immigrant voices. \n\n**May D
 ay 2025 we are standing united.** We&#39\;re organizing for a world where e
 very family has housing\, healthcare\, fair wages\, union protection\, and 
 safety—regardless of race\, zip code\, or immigration status.\n\nThey’re de
 funding our schools\, privatizing public services\, attacking unions\, and 
 targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. This is a war on worki
 ng people—and **we will not stand down**. \n\nThis May Day\, we will turn t
 he page. This is the beginning of a new era—one where working families lead
 \, immigrants are protected\, and no one is left behind. This is not charit
 y. This is not a request. We are reclaiming our power from corporate elites
 \, and we will not be intimidated by Trump\, Musk\, or their billionaire ba
 ckers. They’ve ruled for too long. **Their time is up.**\n\nSTOP THE BILLIO
 NAIRE TAKEOVER.\nWE ARE THE MANY. THEY ARE THE FEW.\nTHIS IS MAY DAY. JOIN 
 US.\n\nHow to prepare:\nIMPORTANT: Please provide your cell phone number wh
 en you register so we can send you any last-minute updates to this historic
  event!\n\n***\n\nThank you for signing up! Musk\, Trump and their fellow p
 rofiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages\, on benefits\
 , on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights\, break our unions\, a
 nd silence immigrant voices. But we won’t let them. Together\, we will stan
 d strong and create a world where every family has housing\, healthcare\, f
 air wages\, union protection\, and safety—regardless of race\, zip code\, o

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy are partnering with Durham Dem
 ocrats to protest at the Tesla car dealership to stand up against Musk\, DO
 GE\, and our constitutional crisis. This is a nonpartisan event\, all are w
 elcome!\n\n\nThis will be a nonviolent protest in which we want to make our
  voices heard that we reject Musk and need him to go.\n\nWhy are our Senato
 rs Thom Tillis and Ted Budd ignoring the concerns of their constituents? Th
 ey MUST stand up for the constitution and our federal institutions. WE WILL
  BE PROTESTING WEEKLY until we receive a PUBLIC RESPONSE and CLEAR ACTION f
 rom Senators Tillis and Budd to oppose this administration&#39\;s unconstit
 utional actions.\n\n\nPlease bring signs both against Musk but also to enco
 urage people to get engaged and active in the fight. We need people to do m
 ore than honk their horn.\n\nOur message is also for Tillis and Budd to tak
 e a stand. And we need more than Democrats coming to these protests as many
  will be harmed by this administration. Please reach out to those you might
  not normally reach out to to find common ground.\n\nParking will be tight.
  We suggest carpooling. There is some parking on Grove Church Road and Barr
 owood. As a last resort\, we can try to park at nearby businesses.\n\nHow t
 o prepare:\nBe proud and say it loud. We did not elect Musk\, and he needs 
 to go as he continues to break the law and make decisions that benefit hims

DESCRIPTION:Join us on the first Sunday of the month as we do a coordinated
  demonstration on multiple corners (Feb 1 is just for colleges and has its 
 own link). All events are from 1pm-2:30pm as we host “Cultivating Courage b
 y Covering Corners\,” a peaceful visibility event designed to build courage
  and unity in support of democracy. \n\nPlease sign up for your corner on S
 ignUp Genius:  \n\nSmall groups will gather on consecutive corners along a 
 key stretch of road\, holding positive\, pro-democracy signs. We will cover
  corners in areas where ED4D does typically do not demonstrate: Creedmoor\,
  Holly Springs\, and XXX. All of these areas are purple. \n\nThe purpose is
  to build motivation for folks to join us. By standing together on multiple
  corners simultaneously\, we show our community that courage is contagious—
 that even small acts of presence can inspire others to stand up for shared 
 values.\n\nEach participant plays an essential role: being visible\, being 
 brave\, and encouraging others to do the same. The goal is to create a ripp
 le of courage that spreads across our community and beyond.\n\nWe will have
  one common sign at each corner. People will need to bring their own signs.
  Please also consider bring an American flag along with one of several othe
 r flags (rainbow flag\, Palestine flag\, Mexican flag\, Ukraine flag)\, to 
 make it clear we are not MAGA. We have rainbow flags for each corner. \n\nP
 lease make signs that say\, “Stand up\, you are not alone!” “Resist!” “Cour
 age is contagious!” &quot\;Call your elected officials&quot\; &quot\;Vote&q
 uot\; &quot\;We the People Have Power!&quot\; &quot\;Start your own demonst

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy are partnering with Durham Dem
 ocrats to protest at the Tesla car dealership to stand up against Musk\, DO
 GE\, and our constitutional crisis. This is a nonpartisan event\, all are w
 elcome!\n\n\nThis will be a nonviolent protest in which we want to make our
  voices heard that we reject Musk and need him to go.\n\nWhy are our Senato
 rs Thom Tillis and Ted Budd ignoring the concerns of their constituents? Th
 ey MUST stand up for the constitution and our federal institutions. WE WILL
  BE PROTESTING WEEKLY until we receive a PUBLIC RESPONSE and CLEAR ACTION f
 rom Senators Tillis and Budd to oppose this administration&#39\;s unconstit
 utional actions.\n\n\nPlease bring signs both against Musk but also to enco
 urage people to get engaged and active in the fight. We need people to do m
 ore than honk their horn.\n\nOur message is also for Tillis and Budd to tak
 e a stand. And we need more than Democrats coming to these protests as many
  will be harmed by this administration. Please reach out to those you might
  not normally reach out to to find common ground.\n\nParking will be tight.
  We suggest carpooling. There is some parking on Grove Church Road and Barr
 owood. As a last resort\, we can try to park at nearby businesses.\n\nHow t
 o prepare:\nBe proud and say it loud. We did not elect Musk\, and he needs 
 to go as he continues to break the law and make decisions that benefit hims
 elf and hurt Americans. Bring signs. Bring friends. Let&#39\;s make our voi
 ces be heard!!\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mobiliz

DESCRIPTION:Labor and community are planning more than a barbecue on Labor 
 Day this year because we have to stop the billionaire takeover. Trump and h
 is billionaire friends are converting the government into their private slu
 sh fund. Trump just passed the largest wealth giveaway in the history of th
 e US. The money they take from working families\, they put in billionaires’
  pockets and set aside to fund Trump&#39\;s private army of ICE agents.\n\n
 Just like any bad boss\, the way we stop the takeover is with collective ac
 tion. We are working people rising up to stop the billionaire takeover–not 
 just through the ballot box or the courts\, but through building a bigger a
 nd stronger movement. We are growing our movement and fighting for a countr
 y that is more fair\, just\, equitable\, and free for all of us—and not jus
 t a chosen few. \n\nOn September 1st we will continue the movement we launc
 hed together on May 1st\, standing in solidarity with all our communities u
 nder attack and fighting for real wins for all our people.\n\nThousands of 
 communities across the country are taking a stand on Labor Day\, join us! W
 e will be in the streets\, outside the offices of the corporate criminals w
 ho are behind the attacks on our freedoms\, and at congressional offices. T
 ogether we will **demand a country that puts workers over billionaires.**\n

DESCRIPTION:Across the country—from fruit fields in California to classroom
 s in Chicago\, from kitchens in Queens to loading docks in Atlanta—working 
 people are rising up. **We are demanding a country that puts our families o
 ver their fortunes**—public schools over private profits\, healthcare over 
 hedge funds\, housing over homelessness.\n\nMusk\, Trump and their fellow p
 rofiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages\, on benefits\
 , on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights\, break our unions\, a
 nd silence immigrant voices. \n\n**May Day 2025 we are standing united.** W
 e&#39\;re organizing for a world where every family has housing\, healthcar
 e\, fair wages\, union protection\, and safety—regardless of race\, zip cod
 e\, or immigration status.\n\nThey’re defunding our schools\, privatizing p
 ublic services\, attacking unions\, and targeting immigrant families with f
 ear and violence. This is a war on working people—and **we will not stand d
 own**. \n\nThis May Day\, we will turn the page. This is the beginning of a
  new era—one where working families lead\, immigrants are protected\, and n
 o one is left behind. This is not charity. This is not a request. We are re
 claiming our power from corporate elites\, and we will not be intimidated b
 y Trump\, Musk\, or their billionaire backers. They’ve ruled for too long. 
 **Their time is up.**\n\nSTOP THE BILLIONAIRE TAKEOVER.\nWE ARE THE MANY. T
 HEY ARE THE FEW.\nTHIS IS MAY DAY. JOIN US.\n\nHow to prepare:\nThank you f
 or signing up! Musk\, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to creat
 e a race to the bottom—on wages\, on benefits\, on dignity itself. They wan
 t to erase labor rights\, break our unions\, and silence immigrant voices. 
 But we won’t let them. Together\, we will stand strong and create a world w
 here every family has housing\, healthcare\, fair wages\, union protection\
 , and safety—regardless of race\, zip code\, or immigration status.\n\nBrin
 g a water bottle\, dress for the weather\, and reach out if you have any qu
 estions. And spread the word!\n\n**Please note:** a core principle behind o
 ur May Day actions is a commitment to nonviolence in all we do. We expect a
 ll participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with tho
 se who disagree with our values.\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=h

DESCRIPTION:Engaged Durhamites for Democracy\n \nOn Sunday\, November 23rd 
 from 11am-12:30pm\, we will host “Cultivating Courage by Covering a Corner.
 ” \n\nThis event is simple. We ask that people find a corner near their hou
 se or a church\, and we all demonstrate at the same time. We have counted t
 he number of demonstrators (not counting double\, triple\, quadruple\, etc.
  folks) we had over 200 unique protectors each week. If each of these prote
 ctors heads to a corner with a friend or two\, we could cover 100-200 corne
 rs at the same time. Think about people driving by and seeing demonstration
 s EVERYWHERE. Courage is contagious!! \n\nAnd the point is not to have larg
 e groups at a small number of corners but rather to spread out to have fewe
 r people to cover a large number of corners. So you can do this solo or wit
 h a friend or two.\n\nAnd the point is not to have large groups at a small 
 number of corners but rather to spread out to have fewer people to cover a 
 large number of corners. So\, you can do this solo or with a friend or two.
  The hope that our being out there inspires others to join us. And of cours
 e\, please do what feels safe to you. You might not be comfortable with jus
 t two people. And this will vary depending on where you live. Those in redd
 er areas might want a few more joining. \n\nPeople will need to bring their
  own signs. Please also consider bring an American flag along with one of s
 everal other flags (rainbow flag\, Palestine flag\, Mexican flag\, Ukraine 
 flag)\, to make it clear we are not MAGA. We might provide rainbow flags fo
 r those who cannot get them. \n\nPlease make signs that say\, “Stand up\, y
 ou are not alone!” “Resist!” “Courage is contagious!”  We also want to spre
 ad the word about “Blackout the System Nov 25-Dec 2!” where we are encourag
 ing folks to shut it down by not purchasing\, working\, traveling on those 
 dates. Yes\, those dates cover Thanksgiving\, Black Friday\, and Cyber Mond
 ay. We need to stop feeding the corporations who are starving us.\n\nWe wil
 l have a safety call for those participating on Thursday Nov 20th at 7pm: \

DESCRIPTION:Siembra NC\n \nLuis has been a Duke University employee for 19 
 years\, and on September 8\, he’s going to be fired. Luis and 60\,000 other
  Hondurans were granted TPS status thirty years ago\, and the Trump Adminis
 tration has decided that will end on September 8.\n\nThat’s why we’re going
  to ride a (charter) bus with Luis on September 4\, to ask Sen. Ted Budd an
 d the NC GOP leaders of the General Assembly – who all describe themselves 
 as good friends of Donald Trump – to ask him to use his authority to grant 
 Luis and other Hondurans deferred removal and employment authorization. Unt
 il then\, we’re asking anyone who supports Luis\, to ride his Duke Transit 
 bus with him (schedule will be posted below)\, bring friends\, listen to hi

 ith him on September 4.\n \nhttps://actionnetwork.org/events/ride-the-bus-w

DESCRIPTION:2025 NC Union Power Summer Canvass\n\nEven before billionaires 
 nearly doubled their wealth during the pandemic\, income inequality had rea
 ched levels not seen since the Great Depression. In NC a new confederate-mi
 nded Republican Party holds power through a combination of voter suppressio
 n tactics and gerrymandered districts designed to institute minority rule. 
 The brewing constitutional crisis signals the early days of an autocratic r
 egime under Trump.\n\nUnions and aligned organizations must lead the fight 
 back through a multi-year strategy of new union organizing\, political educ
 ation\, and electoral wins. To move in this direction and create a vehicle 
 for deeper strategic collaboration\, UNITE HERE\, UAW\, and CWA\, are invit
 ing in aligned groups to participate in a shared training and canvass progr
 am this July with hopes of building longer term strategic partnership and d
 eepening alignment. \n\nJoin us to canvass and be a part of this movement!\

DESCRIPTION:The SAVE Act is a Republican bill currently working its way thr
 ough Congress that would require all US voters to register using their pass
 port or birth certificate (and if your name has changed because of marriage
  or another reason a birth certificate will not suffice.) It would disenfra
 nchise at least half of American voters. We&#39\;re going door to door to a
 sk voters to call Senator Thom Tillis to tell him to vote no on this attack
  on the right to vote.\n\nLots of people make the call! It&#39\;s works and
