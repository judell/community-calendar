  Frank<br></p>Birding on SATURDAY My 14\, 2022\, 8:30 am to approximately 1
 0:30 am at Wendell Community Park\, 601 West 3rd Street\, Wendell\, NC<br>L
 eader is Frank Doherty ( <a href="mailto:fdoherty@nc.rr.com">fdoherty@nc.rr
 .com</a> )<br>We encourage you to sign up via Meetup.com for this event\, a
 s we want to limit the walk to about 25 people.&nbsp\;<br><br><p>RSVP on Me
 etup opens around April March 2&nbsp\; (1) to give everyone who receives th
 e Wake Audubon e-newsletter a chance to get on the RSVP and (2) to prevent 
 someone from signing up weeks ahead and THEN not going because they forgot!
 <br></p><p></p><p>Technically\, an RSVP is not required for this birdwalk\,
  but it is helpful. And more than 20 people it gets\, well\, difficult to f
 ind birds. But we manage!</p><p></p><p>Note: at times there is an event at 
 the park and thus an entrance fee -- tell them you are there for the free b
 irdwalk and you might avoid the fee.</p><p></p><p>There is construction at 
 the park entrance\, so drive up towards the Community Center and park in th
 e grassy field on the left. Look for people with binoculars.</p><p></p><p>T
 his birdwalk repeats on the second Saturday of most months. Check Meetup an
 d <a href="http://wakeaudubon.org">wakeaudubon.org</a> calendars for update
 s.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park has unpaved trails that lead us through woodla
 nds\, mowed areas\, and a boardwalk overlooking a marsh with baldcypress. I
 t is one of our easternmost Wake County hotspots\, and just a short drive t
 o the Turnipseed Preserve (which is open on weekends throughout the year an
 d each day in the summer).</p><p></p><p>NOTE: This walk is not conducive fo
 r Birdability attendees. Trails are not paved and there are rough and steep
  areas. Watch your step\, wear sturdy shoes\, and pack water. Can be muddy 
 after heavy rain. And there are a lot of rather fierce ants that cross the 
 trails. There are not fire ants but they can hurt if you are wearing open-t
 oe shoes.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park ebird hotspot: <a href="http://ebird.or

 BIRDWALK: Wendell Park Birding With Frank<br></p>Birding on SATURDAY OCTOBE
 R 8\, 2022\, 8:30 am to approximately 10:30 am at Wendell Community Park\, 
 601 West 3rd Street\, Wendell\, NC<br>Leader is Frank Doherty ( <a href="ma
 ilto:fdoherty@nc.rr.com">fdoherty@nc.rr.com</a> )<br>We encourage you to si
 gn up via Meetup.com for this event\, as we want to limit the walk to about
  25 people.&nbsp\;<br><br><p>RSVP on Meetup about the first of the month&nb
 sp\; (1) to give everyone who receives the Wake Audubon e-newsletter a chan
 ce to get on the RSVP and (2) to prevent someone from signing up weeks ahea
 d and THEN not going because they forgot!<br></p><p></p><p>Technically\, an
  RSVP is not required for this birdwalk\, but it is helpful. And more than 
 20 people it gets\, well\, difficult to find birds. But we manage!</p><p></
 p><p>Note: at times there is an event at the park and thus an entrance fee 
 -- tell them you are there for the free birdwalk and you might avoid the fe
 e.</p><p></p><p>There is construction at the park entrance\, so drive up to
 wards the Community Center and park in the grassy field on the left. Look f
 or people with binoculars.</p><p></p><p>This birdwalk repeats on the second
  Saturday of most months. Check Meetup and <a href="http://wakeaudubon.org"
 >wakeaudubon.org</a> calendars for updates.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park has u
 npaved trails that lead us through woodlands\, mowed areas\, and a boardwal
 k overlooking a marsh with baldcypress. It is one of our easternmost Wake C
 ounty hotspots\, and just a short drive to the Turnipseed Preserve (which i
 s open on weekends throughout the year and each day in the summer).</p><p><
 /p><p>NOTE: This walk is not conducive for Birdability attendees. Trails ar
 e not paved and there are rough and steep areas. Watch your step\, wear stu
 rdy shoes\, and pack water. Can be muddy after heavy rain. And there are a 
 lot of rather fierce ants that cross the trails. There are not fire ants bu
 t they can hurt if you are wearing open-toe shoes.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Par

 et\, Raleigh\, NC: FRIDAY\, (Re-scheduled to ) MARCH 12\, 2021\, from 8:00 
 a.m. SHARP and ending by 9:30 a.m. \nRSVP ON MEETUP\, LIMIT 6\, MASKS REQUI
 RED. \n\n****Meet at the MARSH OVERLOOK\, which is the lowest part of the p
 ark\; park on Washington Street near Glenwood Avenue intersection. Parking 
 is free on that road. You must park within 12 inches of the curb. (Please n
 ote that Fred Fletcher Park has several entrances. Read the parking signs C
 AREFULLY so that your car is not ticketed.)\n We cancel in the event of rai
 n.\nPlease allow extra time for commuter traffic. Note parking instructions
  below. \n\nLeader: Erla Beegle\; Optmystc1@gmail.com or text/call 919-673-
 6136\n\nI drive a white Subaru Forest\, license plate 0PTMYSTC\n\nHere is t
 he hotspot on ebird for Fred Fletcher Park:\nhttps://ebird.org/hotspot/L106
 0828\nAbout 100 species have been seen in this lovely urban park. \n\nFred 
 Fletcher Park is a good beginner's birdwalk: paved walkways and a short wal
 k with several habitats\, and birds that tend to be used to humans. \nFred 
 Fletcher Park has a VERY SMALL marsh and thicket\, plus some mowed fields w
 ith trees and shrubs. Fred Fletcher Park might give us a surprising number 
 of birds for an urban park.\n\nNOTE: There is only a portapotty at this par
 k -- please plan accordingly (Starbucks and MacDonalds nearby on Peace just
  west of Glenwood\, but you have to drive there\, so allow extra time.)\n\n

 a change of plans. Our scheduled speaker\, a nature artist\, cannot make it
 .  Board Member and Museum Ornithology Curator John Gerwin will fill in wit
 h something "artistic".  He will be showing some less-than-ideal bird pictu
 res that he and Bob Oberfelder\, Jeff Beane and others\, have taken over th
 e years. You\, the audience members (in-person and online)\, will study the
 se and like the fine Inspector Clouseau that many of you are\, you will mak
 e your best identification guess! <br><br>Please plan to keep your "score" 
 card handy as we will tally the votes at the end.<br><br>You will enjoy fuz
 zy\, out of focus shots\; birds facing the "wrong way" (I'm sure the bird d
 idn't think it was wrong)\; over-exposed and under-exposed...... but each w
 ill contain some tidbit of clue(s) sufficient for anyone with an advanced d
 egree...... ok you get the point. We will then discuss how one might identi
 fy each of these.<br><br>So join us as we take some artistic liberties with
  what constitutes a "decent" bird photograph\; and test your skills\, and p
 atience\, with the finer points of bird identification. This should be a go

 d return the nestlings to the same labeled gourd. Attendees are able to tou
 ch a nestling\, take photos\, and learn a lot about the life cycle of this 
 charismatic bird. No pets allowed. <br><br>For the Prairie Ridge session: M
 eet outside the outdoor classroom.  To reach this is a simple walk. Park in
  the lot and make your way to the information kiosk (which is on your left 
 soon after you enter the property). There is a wide dirt road that goes sou
 th from the kiosk. Follow this and you will walk right to the classroom. We
  will be on the right (west) side. You will see the nest gourd arrays there

 rasslands are located near Greenville\, NC. The site is home to hundreds of
  <strong>Henslow’s Sparrows</strong> and is the only site in NC where this 
 species breeds regularly. Our speaker in May recently conducted a 3-year st
 udy of the Henslow’s Sparrow at this site. The site is now managed by the N
 C Wildlife Resources Commission to maintain the grasslands and other early 
 succession habitat. As such\, there is a variety of other “early succession
 ” bird species to see\, beyond the sparrow\, in addition to some neat plant
 s\, butterflies\, bees\, etc. <strong><em>It is not a “developed” site\, so
  there are no facilities.</em></strong></p><p>The site is about 2 hours fro
 m Raleigh. And the sparrows can become quiet and furtive by about 10:00. <s
 trong>With this in mind\, we will depart at 6:00am\,</strong> make one brie
 f “pit stop” along the way\, and then make our way to our first stop. We ma
 y be joined by some members from a local bird club out of Greenville.</p><p
 >It may require some significant walking to find the sparrows (up to one mi
 le out in the grasslands). One cannot always predict these sparrow location
 s - we may see one right away or we may need to make the longer walk. Thus\
 , we will want to be ready to begin walking once we arrive at the site.</p>
 <p>Because it is grass and shrubs\, it is very open – no shade. Plan accord
 ingly with hats\, sunscreen\, sunglasses if you like\, and your favorite sn
 acks and beverage. The walking itself is not difficult – it’s fairly flat. 
 But it may be full sun.</p><p>If you wish to “look ahead” at the "Voice of 
 America Game Lands". the approximate address is 10000 Cherry Run road\, Was
 hington. And it is an eBird hotspot\, which you can access in eBird at this
  link: <a>https://ebird.org/hotspot/L557151</a></p>

DESCRIPTION:This is not a Wake Audubon event\, but we are happy to advertis
 e it!\nSCIENCE TONIGHT: CRYPTIC CRAYFISH \nThursday\, January 14\, 2021\, 7
 :00pm - 8:00pm VIRTUAL via the YouTube channel of the NC Museum of Natural 
 Sciences\n\nDetails: see https://naturalsciences.org/calendar/event/science
 -tonight-cryptic-crayfishes/\n\nDetails copied below:\n\nCrayfishes often s
 erve as paths to exploration for naturalists of all ages. Their enigmatic n
 ature and quirky behaviors draw curious naturalists to rivers\, streams\, a
 nd wetlands to search for these familiar animals. What many people don’t re
 alize is that their quarry may be new to science. Dr. Zachary Loughman will
  discuss the process of collecting crayfishes and determining if they have 
 been formally described by explaining the process he went through to comple
 te his first crayfish description. You will learn that you don’t necessaril
 y need to go to the Amazon to find a new species\; you may simply need to v
 isit your local stream or wetland!\n\nTONIGHT’S GUEST\nDr. Zachary Loughman
  is the Co-Graduate Program Director and Zoo Science and Applied Conservati
 on Coordinator at West Liberty University\; he also is a Research Affiliate
  with the NC Museum of Natural Sciences’ Non-molluscan Invertebrate Unit at
  the Museum. He is a tireless advocate for the conservation and appreciatio
 n of North American crayfishes. He serves as the species expert for the Uni
 ted States Fish and Wildlife Service for two federally listed crayfish spec
 ies\, has been involved in the publication of 15 new species of crayfish\, 
 and has over 40 peer-reviewed articles on crayfish systematics\, taxonomy\,
  and conservation. He was named the 2014 Faculty Merrit Professor of the Ye
 ar\, and was awarded the Noble Crayfish Award by the International Associat
 ion of Astacology\, for crayfish conservation and education.\n\nDETAILS\nFe

 ark has unpaved trails that lead us through woodlands\, mowed areas\, and a
  boardwalk overlooking a marsh with baldcypress. It is one of our easternmo

  (which is open on weekends throughout the year and each day in the summer)
 .</p><p></p><p>NOTE: This walk is not conducive for Birdability attendees. 
 Trails are not paved and there are rough and steep areas. Watch your step\,
  wear sturdy shoes\, and pack water. Can be muddy after heavy rain. And the

 umans. \nFred Fletcher Park has a VERY SMALL marsh and thicket\, plus some 
 mowed fields with trees and shrubs. Fred Fletcher Park might give us a surp
 rising number of birds for an urban park.\n\nNOTE: There is only a portapot

 SVP on Meetup opens around April March 2&nbsp\; (1) to give everyone who re
 ceives the Wake Audubon e-newsletter a chance to get on the RSVP and (2) to
  prevent someone from signing up weeks ahead and THEN not going because the
 y forgot!<br></p><p></p><p>Technically\, an RSVP is not required for this b
 irdwalk\, but it is helpful. And more than 20 people it gets\, well\, diffi
 cult to find birds. But we manage!</p><p></p><p>Note: at times there is an 
 event at the park and thus an entrance fee -- tell them you are there for t
 he free birdwalk and you might avoid the fee.</p><p></p><p>There is constru
 ction at the park entrance\, so drive up towards the Community Center and p
 ark in the grassy field on the left. Look for people with binoculars.</p><p

 Meetup and <a href="http://wakeaudubon.org">wakeaudubon.org</a> calendars f
 or updates.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park has unpaved trails that lead us throu
 gh woodlands\, mowed areas\, and a boardwalk overlooking a marsh with baldc
 ypress. It is one of our easternmost Wake County hotspots\, and just a shor
 t drive to the Turnipseed Preserve (which is open on weekends throughout th
 e year and each day in the summer).</p><p></p><p>NOTE: This walk is not con
 ducive for Birdability attendees. Trails are not paved and there are rough 
 and steep areas. Watch your step\, wear sturdy shoes\, and pack water. Can 
 be muddy after heavy rain. And there are a lot of rather fierce ants that c
 ross the trails. There are not fire ants but they can hurt if you are weari

 abiting nearly all land environments and with diverse social structures and
  foraging strategies\, <strong>yet birds were long thought to make limited 
 use of the sense of smell.</strong> Recent behavioral work in birds has sho
 wn important roles for smell in foraging and species recognition\, among ot
 her behaviors. Contributing to this recent surge of interest in bird smell\
 , research has shown that birds have hundreds more olfactory receptor (OR) 
 genes—the genes responsible for detecting odors-- in their genomes than pre
 viously realized.  Together\, these results show that bird OR genomic count
 s are diverse\, evolve dynamically\, and are capable of functionally detect
 ing odors. We'll discuss research that  provides the foundation for future 
 functional characterization of bird ORs across a variety of bird species.</

  a port-a-potty and it is not near the woodcock sites\, so plan accordingly
 . We may have tools but we encourage you to bring strong branch-pruners and
  folding saws for this event. No motorized tools allowed (no chain saws).<b
 r><br>This is an activity best for adults (and teenagers under supervision)

  of the book <strong>F<em>rom Wast</em></strong><strong><em>eland to Wonder
  – Easy Ways We Can Help Heal Earth in the Sub/Urban Landscape</em></strong
 ><span> \, addresses how we can implement on our properties practices that 
 help heal Earth based on first-hand expertise developed at </span><strong>L
 eaf &amp\; Limb (</strong><span> </span><a href="https://www.leaflimb.com/"
  target="_blank">https://www.leaflimb.com/</a><span> </span><strong>)</stro
 ng></p><p>He will begin with the easiest concepts\, like planting saplings 
 and saving mature trees. Then he will move to some more challenging\, more 
 impactful approaches\, like planting pocket forests and replacing our lawns
  with Piedmont Prairies. Finally\, for those who want to help shift paradig
 ms even more\, Basil Camu will discuss how we can use the <a href="https://
 www.leaflimb.com/project-pando/" target="_blank">Project Pando</a> model to
  work with our community to gather native seeds\, raise them into trees\, a
 nd give them away for free.</p><p></p><p>The way we currently manage the su
 burban and urban landscape is creating a wasteland and harming the well-bei
 ng of Earth. We pave over forests\, use giant machines to scrape away healt
 hy soil\, and turn thriving grasslands into dead lawns. Rain is unable to s
 oak into the ground and instead rushes downhill\, causing erosion and flood
 ing. We repeatedly soak the land in toxic chemicals that kill life. There i
 s little food for the birds\, butterflies\, and bees that need it. These ef
 forts are costly\, time-intensive\, and increase CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>
 <p></p><p>Fortunately\, we have an alternative path: we can work with natur
 al systems instead of working against them. By doing so\, we can help heal 
 Earth. We also save time and money because we perform fewer tasks and use f
 ewer products. Caring for trees\, soil\, and the well-being of Earth can yi
 eld a more beautiful world than what we have experienced previously. It can
  fill our lives with joy and purpose\; joy because we experience so many mo
 ments of wonder\, and purpose because we feel empowered to help solve big i
 ssues using the spaces where we live\, work\, and play.</p><p></p><p>See th

 r Wellbeing event\nLet’s come together for the Great Backyard Bird Count!\n
 \nPorch Sit\, Outings into the park\, and Bird Count at White Deer Park 202
 6.02.14 | a Birding for Wellbeing event\n\nSaturday\, February 14\, 2026\, 
 8:15 - 11 a.m.\n\nEnjoy food and fellowship 8:15 – 8:45 a.m. Receive count 
 instructions at 8:45\, to begin birding by 9.\n\nAll skill levels encourage
 d to come\; borrow binoculars from us or bring your own.\n\nSponsors: Wake 
 Audubon\, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Wake County\, and 
 Town of Garner Parks\, Recreation and Cultural Resources.\n\nOur new partne
 rship with NAMI Wake County continues with our 2026 launch of Birding for W
 ellbeing – mindful outings with a slow pace to observe birds\, relax in nat
 ure\, and enjoy social connection in service to our physical and mental hea
 lth.\n\nToday’ practice centers on the unity\, belonging\, and satisfaction
  that can come from gathering together towards a shared goal.\n\nWhat is sl
 ow birding?\n\nIf new to you\, slow birding is an approach to observing bir
 ds that majors on mindfulness and connection\, designed to appeal to person
 s who prefer a more\, relaxed birding environment\, whereby we take time to
  meet one another\, and identify birds\, enjoy their song\, watch their beh
 avior\, and notice their habitats and the other wildlife around them.\n\nWh
 at’s a Bird Sit?\n\nWhile slow birding can take on different forms\, here w
 e’ll sit together on White Deer Park’s beautiful\, covered porch to identif
 y and count birds to submit to the Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC)\, happe
 ning this weekend.\n\nWhen held at places like White Deer Park Nature Cente
 r\, where the parking\, entry path\, Center\, porch\, and restrooms are Ame
 ricans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant\, Bird Sits are highly accessi
 ble for all to participate.\n\nMore info about our venue at White Deer Park
  | Town of Garner\, NC\n\nWhat is the Great Backyard Bird Count?\n\nThe Gre
 at Backyard Bird Count (GBBC) is a free\, fun\, and easy event that engages
  bird watchers of all ages in counting birds. Anyone can take part\, from b
 eginning bird watchers to experts\, from anywhere in the world.\n\nEach che
 cklist submitted during the GBBC helps researchers at Audubon\, Cornell Lab
  of Ornithology\, and Birds Canada to create a real-time snapshot of bird p
 opulations. These are compared year over year to learn how birds are doing\
 , and how to protect them and the environment we share.\n\nLaunched in 1998
  by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and National Audubon Society\, the Great
  Backyard Bird Count (GBBC) was the first online participatory-science (or 
 community or citizen science) project to collect data on wild birds and to 
 display results in near real time. Today it’s the world’s largest biodivers
 ity-related participatory science project!\n\nLearn more here: Great Backya
 rd Bird Count – Join us each February when the world comes together to watc
 h\, learn about\, count\, and celebrate birds.\n\nHow fantastic – we’ll tea
 m together from the comfort of White Deer Park’s Nature Center\, either on 
 the porch\, or inside the Center if the day is super cold – and collectivel
 y contribute to community science!\n\nYour hosts\n\nNAMI Wake County Execut
 ive Director Mark Simon. An avid birder\, Mark is grateful for how birding 
 has served his own mental health and passionate about sharing this source o
 f well-being with others.\n\nWake Audubon board director and Equity\, Diver
 sity\, Inclusion\, and Belonging event lead Rick LaRose (he/him)\, who serv
 es to bring accessible and welcoming ways for everyone to enjoy birds and t
 ake part in nature\, wherever they are in their life journeys.\n\nWhite Dee

 hn\, and Recreation Program Specialist Martha Fisk\, who will be our inside
 rs to the park and all that it offers.\n\nDriving directions and logistics\
 n\nEnter the Park at 2400 Aversboro Rd. (where some maps show Aversboro Rd.
  intersects with Buffaloe Rd.).\n\nTurn left towards the West Parking Lot a
 nd Nature Center.\n\nUpon parking\, pass the main entrance on either side o
 f the building\, and meet on the back porch.\n\nThere’s limited handicapped
  parking near the Center\, but email Rick at rlarose.was@gmail.com if you’l
 l seek handicapped parking\, as more can be added if we know in advance.\n\
 nGendered restrooms are accessed from the outside\, on the left side of the
  building as you approach it from the parking lot.\n\nReach the Center at (
 919) 661-6982 with any questions.\n\nWhat to bring\n\nCoffee\, tea\, and ho
 t chocolate will be available. Bring your own reusable travel mug. Or\, bri
 ng your own breakfast beverage of choice if you’d like something otherwise.
 \n\nBring your own (refillable) water bottle if you intend to drink water. 
 There’s water available inside the Center and at a station by gendered rest
 rooms accessed outside the Center.\n\nThe Center will provide heavy-duty pl
 astic molded classroom chairs for us to sit on inside or outside. Bring a c
 ushion if you’d like\, or your own camp chair if you’d prefer.\n\nWhat to e
 xpect\n\nWe’ll start by snacking on pastries (some gluten free) and beverag
 es as we all greet and enjoy community with each other 8:15 a.m. – 8:45 a.m
 .\n\nIf borrowing binoculars\, please arrive at 8:15 a.m. such that we can 
 assist you with personalized help to focus them for your eyesight\, and all
 ow you time to meet others over snacks and a beverage. There’s no requireme
 nt to use binoculars\, yet\, we’ll have plenty to borrow if you choose to d
 o so and provide a safe space to learn.\n\nWe’ll receive instructions for h
 ow to count and log our bird sightings 8:45 – 9 a.m. and begin counting at 
 9.\n\nWe’ll cluster together with experienced guides. Help to spot birds\, 
 identify birds\, or learn from your guide and others to identify birds that
  may be new to you. Again\, everyone - experienced birders as well as newco
 mers - are welcome.\n\nAt some time into our Bird Sit\, Mark\, Colleen\, Ma
 rtha and others will offer to guide short outings into the park along flat\
 , paved\, accessible trails for anyone who would like to take part.\n\nWe’l
 l count birds along the trails and submit those findings for the Count too.
  We’ll continue to count from the porch as well. That doubles the ways you 
 might contribute to the Count!\n\nWhat bird species frequent the Park and T

 \nNAMI Wake County is the local affiliate for the National Alliance on Ment
 al Illness. We provide advocacy\, education\, support\, and public awarenes
 s so that people affected by mental illness can build better lives.\n\nWhy 
 partner together?\n\nAs more and more stressors impact our everyday lives\,
  the toll on our mental health can be debilitating.\n\nAs remedy\, birding\
 , bird song\, and time in nature are proven to ease stress\, boost mood\, p
 romote community\, and strengthen well-being. We’re a natural fit.

 some very high tech science machines called synchrotrons. Her research focu
 ses on using a variety of chemical analyses to determine what original biol
 ogical material is preserved in fossils and how organisms become fossilized
 . Dr. Anné also studies palaeopathology\, injuries and diseases in long dea
 d patients\, using her chemical background to help in the diagnosis. Not be
 ing species-est\, she has studied everything from dinosaurs to manatees (an
 d all vertebrates in between). She is currently applying her fossil prepara
 tion\, histology and chemistry know-how at the North Carolina Museum of Nat
 ural Sciences\, where she is the Assistant Lab Manager of the SECU DinoLab.
  When she’s not zapping fossils with X-ray\, she’s traveling the world with
  a good book and playlist in hand.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

 p><p dir="ltr">Description: The Painted Bunting\, sometimes called the nonp
 areil\, is one of those iconic species that is known\, and beloved\, by man
 y. At the same time\, there are many things about the species that we do no
 t know. There are two main populations\, and that in the southeastern U.S. 
 has a much smaller range and population size than the one out west.  We con
 sider the SE population to be “threatened” – by trapping\, climate change\,
  and coastal development.  </p><p dir="ltr">For this program\, John Gerwin 
 and Evan Buckland will cover the state of the Painted Bunting in NC\, and t
 he work that they are doing to learn more about how these birds “make a liv
 ing”.  John will introduce the species and its natural history. Evan will t
 hen take over\, from Wilmington (<b><i>over Zoom</i></b>) and showcase our 
 current efforts to trap\, tag\, and track individual buntings. </p><p>Park 
 (for free after 6:30 pm) and walk to the main museum entrance on Jones Stre
 et\, <strong>just to the right of the giant globe.</strong> <b><i>Since the
  NCSM is closed at night\, someone will be at the door ONLY from 7 to 7:45 
 to let you in\, so be on time.</i></b> Take the elevator to the fourth floo

 h peak numbers in the Wake County region in late July\, and this continues 
 through August. John Gerwin &amp\; John Connors will co-lead another butter
 fly walkabout\, in two locations\, to point out and discuss the local  lepi
 doptera. We begin at Raulston Arboretum where we will spend 2 hours among v
 arious garden plots. Afterwards\, we head over to Prairie Ridge Ecostation\
 , about a mile to the NW\, and enjoy the native plant garden area\, and nea
 rby meadow.  We should see additional species there. <br><br>Please begin t
 o assemble in the patio/entrance area of the Raulston Arboretum at 8:45 a.m
 . We will assemble in the shade by the visitor center\, and spend a few min
 utes going over a bit of the life cycle of a butterfly and some natural his
 tory tidbits. We will then head out to walk the garden paths\, and spend a 
 couple hours finding and identifying and discussing the butterflies we can 
 find.<br><br>There is parking available in both locations. There are bathro
 oms and buildings at each location. It’s August and of course it can become
  quite warm\, even by 11:00. With that in mind\, we will adjust as needed. 
  <br>We’re sure folks will prepare as needed but as a reminder\, plan for a
  sunny morning\; bring a beverage or 3\, snacks\, hat\, sunscreen\, and com
 fortable shoes to walk in. The paths at Raulston are mostly paved - and eve
 n when we are in the grass\, it’s flat and solid ground. At Prairie Ridge\,
  it is easy to walk from the parking lot to the gardens. As such\, even kid
 s in a stroller can attend!  We walk at a very slow pace - so we feel this 
 event is good for all ages and stages. Dogs are not permitted at either loc
 ation. <br><br>RSVP is not required but encouraged because August also ofte
 n brings stormy weather. Please RSVP to John Gerwin at <a href="mailto:bird

 UARY 14\, 2023\, 8:30 am to approximately 10:30 am at Wendell Community Par
 k\, 601 West 3rd Street\, Wendell\, NC<br>Leader is Frank Doherty ( <a href
 ="mailto:fdoherty@nc.rr.com">fdoherty@nc.rr.com</a> )<br>We encourage you t
 o sign up via Meetup.com for this event\, as we want to limit the walk to a
 bout 25 people.&nbsp\;<br><br><p>RSVP on Meetup about the first of the mont
 h&nbsp\; (1) to give everyone who receives the Wake Audubon e-newsletter a 
 chance to get on the RSVP and (2) to prevent someone from signing up weeks 
 ahead and THEN not going because they forgot!<br></p><p></p><p>Technically\
 , an RSVP is not required for this birdwalk\, but it is helpful. And more t
 han 20 people it gets\, well\, difficult to find birds. But we manage!</p><
 p></p><p>Note: at times there is an event at the park and thus an entrance 
 fee -- tell them you are there for the free birdwalk and you might avoid th
 e fee.</p><p></p><p>There is construction at the park entrance\, so drive u
 p towards the Community Center and park in the grassy field on the left. Lo
 ok for people with binoculars.</p><p></p><p>This birdwalk repeats on the se
 cond Saturday of most months. Check Meetup and <a href="http://wakeaudubon.
 org">wakeaudubon.org</a> calendars for updates.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park h
 as unpaved trails that lead us through woodlands\, mowed areas\, and a boar
 dwalk overlooking a marsh with baldcypress. It is one of our easternmost Wa
 ke County hotspots\, and just a short drive to the Turnipseed Preserve (whi
 ch is open on weekends throughout the year and each day in the summer).</p>
 <p></p><p>NOTE: This walk is not conducive for Birdability attendees. Trail
 s are not paved and there are rough and steep areas. Watch your step\, wear
  sturdy shoes\, and pack water. Can be muddy after heavy rain. And there ar
 e a lot of rather fierce ants that cross the trails. There are not fire ant
 s but they can hurt if you are wearing open-toe shoes.</p><p></p><p>Wendell

 there are no paved trails and some trails are steep and slippery.&nbsp\; &n
 bsp\;Wendell Park has unpaved trails that lead us through woodlands\, mowed
  areas\, and a boardwalk overlooking a marsh with baldcypress. It is one of
  our easternmost Wake County hotspots\, and just a short drive to the Turni
 pseed Preserve (which is open on weekends throughout the year and each day 
 in the summer).</p><p></p><p>NOTE: This walk is not conducive for Birdabili
 ty attendees. Trails are not paved and there are rough and steep areas. Wat
 ch your step\, wear sturdy shoes\, and pack water. Can be muddy after heavy
  rain. And there are a lot of rather fierce ants that cross the trails. The
 re are not fire ants but they can hurt if you are wearing open-toe shoes.</

 to the event\, and a seat in the reserved section. Leigh Ann will sign book

 br><br>More information: <br><em><i>"<u><b>Night Magic"</b></u></i></em> is
  a glorious celebration of the dark! Every page of this lyrical book feels 
 like an opportunity to ask: How did I not know about this before? For examp
 le\, we learn that it can take hours\, not minutes\, for human eyes to reac
 h full night vision capacity. And that there are thousands of firefly speci
 es on earth\, each with flash patterns as unique as fingerprints... In this
  age of increasing artificial light\, <b>Night Magic </b>is an invitation t
 o focus on the biodiversity that surrounds us. We do not need to stargaze i
 nto the distant cosmos or to dive into the depths of oceans to find awe in 
 the dark—when we reclaim night\, dazzling wonders can be found in our own b
 ackyards.<br><br>Updated 9/17/24 by LE Beegle

  view from the long bridge\, then walk some distance clockwise along the 2-
 mile loop of paved scenic greenway trails around the lake. We hope to see <
 strong>Bald Eagles</strong> and <strong>Great Blue Herons</strong> (both ne
 st along the trail)\, as well as woodpeckers\, sparrows\, cardinals\, and e
 arly winter waterfowl. While the path is paved\, we may step off to the sid

 br>Jerry Reynolds\, Head of Outreach at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences\,
  lives in rural Johnston County near Clayton. Behind his house is a 50-acre
  mixed forest\, unremarkable except that it’s still there! We are rapidly a
 nd constantly losing these small forested tracts\, almost without notice. B
 ut Jerry notices! He mourns the loss of native plants and animals being lit
 erally scraped off the landscape by our growing population. Since moving to
  Johnston County in 2004\, Jerry has photographed and documented the plants
 \, fungi\, and wildlife in his backyard and the adjacent forest. From ghost
  fireflies to least brook lampreys<br>to the Amazing Possum Hole Chronicles

 <p>BIRDWALK: Wendell Park Birding With Frank<br></p>Birding on SATURDAY FEB
 RUARY 11\, 2023\, 8:30 am to approximately 10:30 am at Wendell Community Pa
 rk\, 601 West 3rd Street\, Wendell\, NC<br>Leader is Frank Doherty ( <a hre
 f="mailto:fdoherty@nc.rr.com">fdoherty@nc.rr.com</a> )<br>We encourage you 
 to sign up via Meetup.com for this event\, as we want to limit the walk to 
 about 25 people. <br><br><p>RSVP on Meetup about the first of the month  (1
 ) to give everyone who receives the Wake Audubon e-newsletter a chance to g
 et on the RSVP and (2) to prevent someone from signing up weeks ahead and T
 HEN not going because they forgot!<br></p><p></p><p>Technically\, an RSVP i
 s not required for this birdwalk\, but it is helpful. And more than 20 peop
 le it gets\, well\, difficult to find birds. But we manage!</p><p></p><p>No
 te: at times there is an event at the park and thus an entrance fee -- tell
  them you are there for the free birdwalk and you might avoid the fee.</p><
 p></p><p>There is construction at the park entrance\, so drive up towards t
 he Community Center and park in the grassy field on the left. Look for peop
 le with binoculars.</p><p></p><p>This birdwalk repeats on the second Saturd
 ay of most months. Check Meetup and <a href="http://wakeaudubon.org">wakeau
 dubon.org</a> calendars for updates.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park has unpaved 
 trails that lead us through woodlands\, mowed areas\, and a boardwalk overl
 ooking a marsh with baldcypress. It is one of our easternmost Wake County h
 otspots\, and just a short drive to the Turnipseed Preserve (which is open 
 on weekends throughout the year and each day in the summer).</p><p></p><p>N
 OTE: This walk is not conducive for Birdability attendees. Trails are not p
 aved and there are rough and steep areas. Watch your step\, wear sturdy sho
 es\, and pack water. Can be muddy after heavy rain. And there are a lot of 
 rather fierce ants that cross the trails. There are not fire ants but they 
 can hurt if you are wearing open-toe shoes.</p><p></p><p>Wendell Park ebird

 song\, and time in nature are proven to ease stress\, boost mood\, promote 
 community\, and strengthen well-being.</a> We’re a natural fit.<br>What is 
 slow birding?<br>If new to you\, slow birding is an approach to observing b
 irds that majors on mindfulness and connection\, designed to appeal to pers
 ons who prefer a more\, relaxed birding environment\, whereby we take time 
 to meet one another\, and identify birds\, enjoy their song\, watch their b
 ehavior\, and notice their habitats and the other wildlife around them.'<br
 ><br>While slow birding can take on different forms\, here we’ll amble arou
 nd the lake to view the key species that call Shelley Lake Park home.<br><b
 r>Your hosts<br>Our lead guide will be NAMI Wake County Executive Director 
 Mark Simon. An avid birder\, Mark is grateful for how birding has served hi
 s own mental health and Co-guiding this outing will be Wake Audubon volunte

 . Meet at the picnic tables to the right of the Center.<br><br><strong>What
  to expect</strong><br>We’ll start by snacking on pastries (some gluten fre
 e) as we all greet and enjoy community with each other 8:30 a.m. – 9 a.m. B
 ring your own breakfast beverage of choice if you’d like.<br>During this ti
 me\, we’ll assist anyone to borrow binoculars. If borrowing binoculars\, <s
 trong>please arrive by 8:20</strong> <strong>to allow time to reach our gat
 hering spot\, be provided a pair and receive personalized help to focus the
 m for your eyesight</strong>\, meet other birders\, and grab a snack. There
 ’s no requirement to use binoculars\, yet\, we’ll have plenty to borrow if 
 you choose to do so and provide a safe space to learn.<br><br><strong>Bring
  your own (refillable) water bottle</strong> if you intend to drink and/or 
 carry water with you on the outing. There’s water available at a station ou
 tside gendered restrooms located adjacent to the parking lot.<br>We’ll ask 
 anyone needing to use them or refill a water bottle to please do so in time
  for our 9 a.m. birding start.<br><br>We’ll amble to the lake and enjoy the
  view from the long bridge\, then traverse some distance clockwise along th
 e 2-mile loop of paved scenic greenway trails around the lake. We’ll likely
  see <strong>Bald Eagles</strong> and <strong>Great Blue Herons</strong> (b
 oth are actively nesting along the trail)\, as well as woodpeckers\, sparro
 ws\, cardinals\, and winter waterfowl. While the path is paved\, we may ste
 p off to the side of it at times\, or onto grassy fields\, being aware of o
 thers and any cyclists.<br><br>The paved trail from the Center to the lake 
 declines at a slope of 7 degrees and is then relatively flat around the lak
 e. There’s a serpentine incline at the dam end of the lake (near the end of
  our path)\, and a short\, 15-degree decline that can be avoided by a takin
 g an alternate trail back to the center. If you use an adaptive mobility de

 Anné (aka Indy) received her PhD from the University of Manchester\, UK whe
 re she studied the chemistry of bone remodeling and repair using some very 
 high tech science machines called synchrotrons. Her research focuses on usi
 ng a variety of chemical analyses to determine what original biological mat
 erial is preserved in fossils and how organisms become fossilized. Dr. Anné
  also studies palaeopathology\, injuries and diseases in long dead patients
 \, using her chemical background to help in the diagnosis. Not being specie
 s-est\, she has studied everything from dinosaurs to manatees (and all vert
 ebrates in between). She is currently applying her fossil preparation\, his
 tology and chemistry know-how at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Scien
 ces\, where she is the Assistant Lab Manager of the SECU DinoLab. When she’
 s not zapping fossils with X-ray\, she’s traveling the world with a good bo
 ok and playlist in hand.</p><p></p><p>This meeting will be held In-person +

 et\, Raleigh\, NC: FRIDAY\, (Re-scheduled to ) JANUARY 15\, 2021\, from 8:0
 0 a.m. SHARP and ending by 9:30 a.m. \nRSVP ON MEETUP\, LIMIT 6\, MASKS REQ
 UIRED. \n\n****Meet at the MARSH OVERLOOK\, which is the lowest part of the
  park\; park on Washington Street near Glenwood Avenue intersection. Parkin
 g is free on that road. You must park within 12 inches of the curb. (Please
  note that Fred Fletcher Park has several entrances. Read the parking signs
  CAREFULLY so that your car is not ticketed.)\n We cancel in the event of r
 ain.\nPlease allow extra time for commuter traffic. Note parking instructio
 ns below. \n\nLeader: Erla Beegle\; Optmystc1@gmail.com or text/call 919-67
 3-6136\n\nI drive a white Subaru Forest\, license plate 0PTMYSTC\n\nHere is
  the hotspot on ebird for Fred Fletcher Park:\nhttps://ebird.org/hotspot/L1
 060828\nAbout 100 species have been seen in this lovely urban park. \n\nFre
 d Fletcher Park is a good beginner's birdwalk: paved walkways and a short w
 alk with several habitats\, and birds that tend to be used to humans. \nFre
 d Fletcher Park has a VERY SMALL marsh and thicket\, plus some mowed fields
  with trees and shrubs. Fred Fletcher Park might give us a surprising numbe
 r of birds for an urban park.\n\nNOTE: There is only a portapotty at this p
 ark -- please plan accordingly (Starbucks and MacDonalds nearby on Peace ju
 st west of Glenwood\, but you have to drive there\, so allow extra time.)\n
 \nPS Thanks for joining our WAS Meetup.\nWe hope you will help us by also j

  help change that.</p><p>The pace of this walk will be specifically geared 
 towards building our beginner birding skills\; birders of all talents are w
 elcome.</p><p>We’ll take a leisurely stroll along gently sloped grassy trai
 ls through <a href="https://naturalsciences.org/prairie-ridge" target="_bla

 e various birds to be found among the habitats. The unpaved path is 1 mile 
 or so depending on our pace.</p><p>Borrow binoculars from us or bring your 
 own. <em>If borrowing binoculars\, please arrive at 8:45 to be provided a p
 air and receive personalized help to focus them for your eyesight.</em></p>
 <p>Driving directions: GPS to <strong>1671 Gold Star Dr.\, Raleigh</strong>
 . Entrance is a short distance down Gold Star Dr. from Reedy Creek Rd. Turn
  onto the gravel drive and parking area. You'll see Wake Audubon's chimney 
 swift roost tower to the right. Park\, then meet at the top left of the lot

 t's see if we can add to that list!<br><br>Fred Fletcher Park is a good beg
 inner's birdwalk: paved walkways and a short walk with several habitats\, a
 nd birds that tend to be used to humans. But it MIGHT not be worth driving 
 a long way for this park\, unless you are going to head to the downtown mus

 ent at 9:30).<br>Fred Fletcher Park has a VERY SMALL marsh and thicket\, pl
 us some mowed fields with trees and shrubs. Fred Fletcher Park might give u
 s a surprising number of birds for an urban park.<br><br>NOTE: There is onl

DESCRIPTION:Fred Fletcher Park birdwalk is CANCELLED DUE TO WINTER WEATHER 
 ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR WAKE COUNTY. Some areas are experiencing freezing ra
 in\, and some roads are flooded and hazardous. It isn't worth the risk.<br>
 <br>If you want to birdwatch somewhere today\, I suggest you try Blue Jay P
 oint County Park. Turn left once inside the park entrance and park next to 
 the (closed) naturalist center\, and watch birds from their covered front p
 orch at the birdfeeders. You are almost guaranteed to see REAL Purple Finch
  (except ebird will mark them "rare" this week due to the GBBC). The restro
 oms are open via the side door of the naturalist center.<br><br>I really do

 pm - 8:00pm VIRTUAL via the YouTube channel of the NC Museum of Natural Sci
 ences\n\nMICROPLASTICS IN OUR AIR\, WATER\, AND BODIES: WHY SHOULD WE BE CO
 NCERNED?\nDetails: see https://naturalsciences.org/calendar/event/science-t
 onight-microplastics/\n\nDetails copied below:\n\nGlobal production of plas
 tic has been rapidly rising since plastics' creation in the early 1900s. Du
 e to the overwhelming quantities being produced and improper disposal\, pla
 stic is exponentially accumulating in landfills\, oceans\, and soils.\nAs p
 lastic decays\, microplastics and potentially toxic polymer additives are r
 eleased. Microplastics and the chemicals associated with plastic are now ub
 iquitous globally\, from indoor to outdoor air\, from oceans to drinking wa
 ter\, and from soils to food made for human consumption.\n\nSCIENCE TONIGHT
 'S GUEST SPEAKER:\nImari Walker will discuss the presence of these micropla
 stics in the environment and reasons we should be concerned. Imari Walker i
 s a PhD Candidate at Duke University investigating the fate\, occurrence an
 d transformation of plastic additives within freshwater environments. In pa
 rticular\, her dissertation work focuses on endocrine-disrupting chemicals 
 like Bisphenol A (BPA) that are of concern to human health and the environm
 ent. Before Duke\, Imari completed her Bachelor of Marine Science degree at
  the University of California\, Berkeley.\n\nAlongside her PhD work\, Imari
  uses her science communication-based YouTube channel to share information 
 about plastic pollution\, microplastics and chemicals associated with these
  consumer products.\n\nDETAILS\nFee: Free\, no registration needed\n\nORGAN

 tart on the road that crosses the dam before walking (or driving) a couple 
 of hundred yards down to the tailrace parking lot and grass along the water
 . The top of the dam is accessed by a 3 foot wide concrete path around the 
 gate. The dam access\, road\, and parking are paved. A paved walkway extend

 self will likely be soggy and may not be passable for rolling assistive dev

 asier.<br><br>This is a family-friendly event\, but there is NO RAILING alo

  will be on relatively flat surfaces (&lt\;5% grade) with the exception of 
 the road that one can drive down to the tailrace. There is 1 signed accessi

 ith a curb cut in the tailrace parking lot. There are ample car parking spa
 ces.<br><br>There are 4 accessible bathrooms at the tailrace. The water fou

 bathrooms are available at the Corps of Engineers Visitor Center uphill unt
 il 4:30 pm. NOTE: if you park at the Visitor Center\, you must walk down to
