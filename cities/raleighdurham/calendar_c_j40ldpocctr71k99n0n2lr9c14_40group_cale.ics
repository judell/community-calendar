 epending on size and design. Templates will be provided for popular shapes 
 like spoon dishes or rectangles\, or you can freehand cut the shape(s) you 
 want. I will teach you how to apply underglaze decal images to personalize

 <b>Please choose local pickup/delivery for the shipping option to avoid shi
 pping fees.</b></strong></p></blockquote><p>FAQ:</p><p>Q: What are catch-al
 l dishes used for?</p><p>A: You’re making them\, so it’s up to you\, but so
 me of the many uses could be… soy sauce\, spoon rest / teaspoon rest\, air 
 plant holder\, earrings by the bed\, cat food / feeding the cat your human 
 food\, soaps or sponges\, ketchup / dipping sauces\, rings\, conversation p
 iece\, coaster\, ashtray\, candle base\, bobby pins\, paperclips &amp\; doo
 -dads …and more!</p><p></p><p>Q: What kind of ornaments could I make?</p><p
 >A: Plan to create mostly flat ornaments to hang on a tree\, wall\, window\
 , rearview mirror\, or wherever! You can use templates or make your own sha
 pe\, and create a hole to hang them by. Use holiday-themed decals or any of
  the fun designs provided that don’t relate to a season.</p><p></p><p>Q: Do
  I need to know how to work with clay to take this class?</p><p>A: No - you
  do not need to have any knowledge about working with clay to make trinket 
 dishes using this method!</p><p></p><p>Q: What do I need to bring?</p><p>A:
  Your ID for a beverage and clothes you don’t mind getting a little dirty. 
 I will provide everything needed to make your dishes. Grab a friend and bri
 ng them too!</p><p></p><p>Q: How long is the class?</p><p>A: The instructio
 n portion of the class will last about 1 hour. Then you will have 1.5 hours
  to explore and finish your dishes\, and I will be there to assist. Please 
 plan to end on time.</p>

 ing together through the creative process. This is a judgment free zone\, a
 s guests will be invited to relax and flow as they are guided through a pai
 nting lesson from a professional artist on an 11x14 inch canvas. Individual
 s will be given the understanding of real world painting techniques\, while
  also being encouraged to express themselves from within\, bringing forth w
 hat feels most natural and instinctive to their own compositions. Consider 
 this as a sensory experience with a focus on the process in its most natura
 l form. Think music\, ambiance\, twinkle lights\, and maybe even getting a 
 little bit of paint on your hands from time to time. Take the parts that sp
 eak to you\, then discard the rest!<br></p><p>Fire pits have been regarded 
 as symbols of warmth and gathering\, prolonging our enjoyment together as t
 he sun diminishes it's light. The winter season is a time of completion and
  enjoyment of all of our accomplishments from the previous year as we rest 
 and prepare for the rebirth of Spring. Fire pits often symbolize those acti
 vities of rest and gathering. </p><p>In this lesson we will be learning abo
 ut how to arrange colors to foster a spatial sense of how they are perceive
 d. We will be giving shape and smoothness to a flickering fire\, as well as
  an indication of heat and movement. We will be illuminating and contrastin
 g against the night sky.</p><p>Meanwhile\, Gizmo Brew Works offers Sunday d
 iscounts on $15 Mimosa Carafes and $5 individual mimosas! Come early and ge
 t those creative juices flowing while sipping and painting in the heart of 
 the University Hill Complex in Durham. This is beautiful open space and is 
 rapidly growing with things to do. <br></p><p>Beverages are not included wi
 th ticket price. Guests may inform the Brewery that they are with our group
  while opening tabs.<br> </p><p>To learn more about Gizmo Brew Works Durham

  they will begin at the scheduled start time. Coming early to get those cre
 ative juices flowing is never a bad idea\, or maybe you’d like to eat first

 rld painting techniques\, while also being encouraged to express themselves
  from within\, bringing forth what feels most natural and instinctive to th
 eir own compositions. Consider this as a sensory experience with a focus on
  the process in its most natural form. Think music\, ambiance\, twinkle lig

 e night sky as long been regarded as a symbol of hopes and dreams. The wint
 er season marks a time of slowing down and coming together to be with those
  who are close with us. Stars are renewal of what is to come. They captivat
 e us with beauty and wonder. While we can not hold or touch them\, still se
 eing them will always give us something to long for.</p><p>In this lesson\,
  we will be learning how to use and exploit colors for spatial depth and fo
 rm. Darkness and negative space helps us to focus on larger masses first an
 d is a discipline that allows us see lit objects with more clarity. We will
  be going inward. Sometimes\, we must close our eyes before we can see. </p

 lights. Check out a menu for a full brew list too! Come early and get those
