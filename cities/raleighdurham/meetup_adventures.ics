SUMMARY:after work bike ride on the ATT 
DESCRIPTION:Triangle Hiking and Outdoors Group\nI know that it’s hard to
  imagine\, given the weather we’ve had from. Mid January to almost mid F
 ebruary\, but it’s time to prepare for the 2026 season of the Tuesday af
 ter work bike rides. This seasonal\, weekly event has been going on since 
 2011! It will begin with just over 1 hour of riding\, and as the days get 
 longer we’ll increase the ride time and distance tracking sunset.\nWe'll
  be starting near Southpoint and final starting point will be sent out Mon
 day evening. Make sure that your bike is in good working order - tires hol
 d air and are up to pressure\, brakes and shifters work and your chain has
  been oiled. We'll be riding just about 1 hours and about 12 miles. The ri
 de is fairly flat and shaded and our pace will be moderate (about 13 mph a
 verage). I recommend a hard tail or hybrid bike\, but if you really want t
 o bring a road bike it's ok\, though you'll likely be a bit bored. Unicycl
 es....? I'll be eating after the ride at a restaurant. You're welcome to j
 oin me if you like. Helmets are required and by signing up you agree to TH
 OG liability waiver statement. Please Note!! Any cancellation less than 30
  hours before the beginning of the event will be considered a "no show"
