SUMMARY:Lunch and Learn: The Missing Link: Adding Your Data to Your App
DESCRIPTION:All Things AI (Live)\nSo you vibe-coded a front-end app—now 
 what? Building a sleek interface is only half the battle. The real magic h
 appens when your data starts moving.\n\nIn this session\, we'll turn stati
 c interfaces into powerful automated tools by connecting front-end platfor
 ms like Softr and Zoho Forms to [Make.com](http://Make.com). You'll learn 
 how to capture data instantly with webhooks\, map information so it lands 
 exactly where it needs to be\, and build multi-step workflows that trigger
  emails\, update CRMs\, or generate documents the moment a form is submitt
 ed.\n\nYou'll learn how to power our app with these no-code tactics.\n\n* 
 **Webhooks & Triggers:** How to capture data instantly as users interact w
 ith your apps.\n* **Data Mapping:** Ensuring information from your forms l
 ands exactly where it needs to be.\n* **Beyond the Entry:** Strategies for
  building multi-step workflows that trigger emails\, update CRMs\, or gene
 rate documents immediately after a form submission.\n\nWhether you're buil
 ding a client portal or a lead generation engine\, you'll leave with a blu
 eprint for seamless flow between your users and your tech stack.

SUMMARY:Ask Us Anything About AI with Google\, Make.com and more...
DESCRIPTION:All Things AI (Live)\nYou don't get access like this very ofte
 n. Also\, we are in the process of coordinating schedules\, so right now t
 he experts are clearing their schedules.\n\nWe're bringing together some o
 f the most experienced AI practitioners in the Triangle—people who build
 \, deploy\, and advise on AI systems every day—for a wide-open **Ask Us 
 Anything session about AI**.\n\nNo slides. No vendor pitches. No rehearsed
  talking points.\n\nJust direct access to experts who've been in the room 
 where real AI decisions get made.\n\nThis is your chance to ask the questi
 ons you can't get answered on LinkedIn or in webinars:\n\n* What's actuall
 y working with AI right now—and what's quietly failing\n* How serious te
 ams move from pilots to production\n* Where generative AI\, agents\, and a
 utomation deliver real ROI\n* What executives get wrong about AI strategy\
 n* How to think about data\, security\, governance\, and risk *before* pro
 blems show up\n* Build vs. buy decisions that won't age badly\n* The skill
 s your team needs this year\, not in theory\n\nIf you're responsible for A
 I decisions\, budgets\, platforms\, or people—or if you're trying to sep
 arate signal from noise—this session is designed for you.\nYou bring the
  questions.\nWe bring the experience.\n\n**Who should attend**\n\n* Techno
 logy and business leaders\n* Builders\, architects\, and operators\n* Prod
 uct\, data\, and platform teams\n* Anyone serious about using AI responsib

SUMMARY:Lunch and Learn: How Small Orgs and Non-Profits are Getting Value 
 out of AI 
DESCRIPTION:All Things AI (Live)\nSmall organizations and nonprofits face 
 mounting pressure to adopt AI while operating on tight budgets without ded
 icated tech teams. Their bilingual\, client-facing staff already juggle di
 rect service\, paperwork\, and community outreach—they're not writing co
 de\, and they shouldn't have to.\nThis session explores what AI adoption a
 ctually looks like in that reality. Drawing on hands-on projects with nonp
 rofits and minority-owned small businesses\, Will demonstrates how to iden
 tify high-value use cases\, design AI workflows *with* staff rather than *
 for* them\, and introduce new tools without creating overwhelm.\nExamples 
 include Spanish-English workflows for grant writing\, documentation and re
 porting\, and day-to-day communication with clients and partners.\n\n**Par
 ticipants will leave with:**\n\n* Patterns that reliably work in low-tech 
 environments\n* Practical guardrails for privacy and quality\n* Ready-to-a
 dapt prompts and process maps to bring back to their teams

SUMMARY:AI for Agents Workshop
DESCRIPTION:All Things AI (Live)\n**Every AI agent is a delegation decisio
 n. This workshop teaches you how to make those decisions well.**\n\n[To pu
 rchase tickets\, visit [https://2026.allthingsai.org/register](https://202
 6.allthingsai.org/register) workshop tickets also include access to the Al
 l Things AI conference on March 24th. ***Price increases after Tuesday\, M
 arch 17 so sign-up early and save $100*** ]\n\nMany organizations have exp
 erimented with AI Agents. Far fewer have moved confidently into sustained\
 , responsible execution.\nAs teams progress from early pilots to real-worl
 d deployment\, leaders often encounter the same challenges: impressive pro
 totypes that stall before production\, uncertainty about where agents actu
 ally add value\, late-breaking security and governance concerns\, and misa
 lignment between business and technical stakeholders about what “success
 ” should look like. Too often\, these issues surface only after cost\, c
 omplexity\, or risk have already compounded.\nThis workshop helps leaders 
 make the shift from experimentation to execution—not by pushing agents e
 verywhere\, but by providing a clear blueprint for **when agents make sens
 e\, when they don’t\, and how to make sound decisions when autonomy is o
 n the table**.\n\n***\n\n#### **The Outcome: Better Decisions\, Earlier**\
 n\nBy the end of this session\, participants will have more than an overvi
 ew of AI Agents. They will leave with a **practical decision-making framew
 ork** they can apply immediately to real initiatives.\nYou’ll be able to
 :\n\n* determine whether an agent is appropriate for a given problem—or 
 whether a copilot or traditional automation is the better choice\n* evalua
 te agent proposals with a clear understanding of autonomy\, risk\, and tra
 deoffs\n* anticipate the organizational\, architectural\, and governance f
 actors that separate successful deployments from stalled experiments\n* id
 entify common failure modes early—while they are still inexpensive to ad
 dress\n\nThe result is clearer judgment about **what to delegate to agents
 \, what to constrain\, and what should remain human**.\n\n***\n\n#### **Wh
 at the Blueprint Covers**\n\nIn this intensive workshop\, business and tec
 hnical leaders will work through a practical blueprint for AI Agent succes
 s\, grounded in real-world constraints and leadership realities.\nKey topi
 cs include:\n\n* understanding degrees of agency and how they change cost\
 , risk\, and accountability\n* distinguishing agents from copilots and tra
 ditional automation—and why that distinction matters\n* identifying use 
 cases where agents consistently create value\, and scenarios where they in
 troduce unnecessary fragility\n* recognizing common pitfalls that derail a
 gent initiatives\, from over-delegation to hidden operational complexity\n
 * aligning organizational readiness\, security\, and governance with the l
 evel of autonomy being introduced\n\nParticipants will also receive a high
 -level technical orientation to the AI Agent ecosystem\, including platfor
 ms\, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\, and model selection tradeoffs. This in
 cludes a balanced discussion of the benefits and risks of using Small Lang
 uage Models (SLMs) in agentic workflows\, particularly when autonomy and t
 ool access are involved.\n\n***\n\n#### **What You’ll Leave With**\n\nPa
 rticipants will leave with:\n\n* A clear framework for deciding **if and w
 hen** AI Agents should be used\n* A practical blueprint outlining the cond
 itions required for agent success—and the signals that indicate trouble\
 n* A realistic understanding of the cost\, complexity\, and operational de
 mands of agent-based systems\n* Clear guidance for incorporating security\
 , governance\, and human oversight from the start\n* A shared language tha
 t aligns business and technical leaders around the same decision criteria\
 n\n***\n\n#### **Who This Is For**\n\nThis workshop is designed for busine
 ss and technical leaders responsible for turning AI experimentation into o
 perational reality\, including:\n\n* Leaders driving digital\, AI\, or tra
 nsformation initiatives (e.g.\, Chief Digital Officers\, Heads of AI\, Tra
 nsformation and Digital Strategy leaders)\n* Technology and architecture l
 eaders accountable for execution and scale (e.g.\, CTOs\, CIOs\, VPs of En
 gineering\, Enterprise and Solution Architects)\n* Product and innovation 
 leaders shaping AI-enabled capabilities (e.g.\, CPOs\, Heads of Product\, 
 Innovation and Emerging Technology leaders)\n* Security\, risk\, and gover
 nance leaders involved in overseeing autonomous or AI-driven systems (e.g.
 \, CISOs\, Responsible AI and Risk leaders)\n\nThis session is especially 
 valuable for leaders who sit at the intersection of strategy and execution
 —those expected to decide **when AI Agents should be used\, how much aut
 hority they should have\, and how to govern them responsibly**.\n\n[To pur
 chase tickets\, visit [https://2026.allthingsai.org/register](https://2026

  Things AI conference on March 24th. ***Price increases after Tuesday\, Ma
