How about that pile of things you actually did finish, but that you can’t possibly use all of? Bring the excess items you’ve made and your spare supplies to trade! Participants will be able to drop their contributions on a reserved table, and everyone can shop the stash. We will operate on an honor system where everyone is encouraged to take roughly the same value of things they brought. \nEven better, once a month our Craft Club will also host a workshop on various topics so you can learn and grow as an artist while you have fun. \nSo grab a drink, get crafty, and plan to hang out for a while to see who all stops by and what type of goods come through the swap. \n\n\nSource: Downtown Durham Inc",

    "description": "Enter a realm where beauty and mortality intertwine in The Song of the Earth, a hauntingly intimate performance of Arnold Schoenberg and Rainer Riehn’s arrangement of Gustav Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde. Scored for a reduced ensemble yet retaining every ounce of Mahler’s emotional depth, this rarely heard transcription brings clarity and immediacy to a masterpiece that meditates on life, loss, and the eternal. With its fusion of symphony and song, East and West, hope and despair, The Song of the Earth offers a deeply human experience that is at once fragile, powerful, and timeless.\n\nSource: Downtown Durham Inc",

    "description": "The Johri lab is interested in better characterizing the shape of the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in organisms and on understanding how selection on functionally important regions affects genome-wide patterns of variation. Population genomic inference currently does not account for the effects of selection across the genome, which is especially problematic in species with compact genomes (i.e., those with a high density of protein-coding and regulatory regions) where natural selection is pervasive. We develop statistical and computational methods that simultaneously account for the effects of selection jointly with other evolutionary processes to make accurate evolutionary inferences (such as historical changes in population size) using sequence variation from natural populations. As most pathogenic species tend to have highly compact genomes and experience strong bouts of selection and drastic repeated bottlenecks, our methodological advances and recent theoretical efforts will be important to uncovering their population and selective history.\n\nSource: Duke University",

You’ll explore how soils behave — how texture, structure and compaction influence water movement, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on sampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along the way, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutrition, exploring how nutrients move through the soil, how fertilizers work and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether you’re troubleshooting problem areas, establishing new garden beds or simply eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet, this course will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow stronger, more resilient plants.\n\nSource: NC State University",

    "description": "The mechanical properties of biological tissues change over time and with disease progression. Quantifying these mechanical properties can thus be instrumental for medical diagnosis and for evaluation of tissue viability for transplant. However, it is exceptionally challenging to mechanically characterize soft and biological materials using conventional testing methods, especially in-vivo. In recent years, volume controlled cavity expansion (VCCE) has emerged as a powerful needle-based method for quantifying the nonlinear properties of soft materials in-situ. In this talk, after briefly revisiting the fundamentals of VCCE, I will describe the translation of VCCE into Digital Palpation (DP); a minimally invasive diagnostic tool offering a quantitative alternative to a clinician's sense of touch. I will describe the application of DP for testing in human tissue and will focus on an ex-vivo study of 35 tests in freshly resected human thyroid nodules. I will show how data from this rapid and minimally invasive mechanical test enables separation between benign and malignant nodules of this highly prevalent cancer and can even hint at resolving oncocytic and follicular sub-types that routinely confound existing diagnosis methods. At present, up to one third of thyroid nodules cannot be decisively classified, leading to avoidable surgical removal of the thyroid gland. We hope that these results can, in the future, help to reduce the large fraction of thyroidectomies (40-70%) that ultimately prove benign and thus avoidable; potentially relieving patients from the potential life-long implications of surgical complications and hormone replacement, and paving the way for the diagnosis of additional diseases.\n\nSource: Duke University",

So, we're working with Trinity leadership to help make those programs more useful for our faculty, and we want to engage the humanities research community in that process. As a first pilot step, we will host RCR training events that will both <b>fulfill the 200-level RCR requirement for attendees</b> and <b>help shape the future of RCR training in the humanities and related disciplines</b>. The initial events will be limited to senior (e.g., associate, full, emeritus) faculty who work in any area of the humanities, arts, and/or interpretive social sciences.

    "description": "QCD and effective field theory together put low energy nuclear physics on solid theoretical footing to calculate observables with some confidence, but open questions remain.  Two related questions are why QCD seems not to violate CP and how the properties of nuclear matter depend on the light quark masses (or equivalently the pion mass).  The classic solution to the former problem is to invoke a new light field, the QCD axion, a well-motivated dark matter candidate which a diverse experimental campaign is currently searching for.  Neutron stars can also probe the QCD axion parameter space if nuclear matter becomes more attractive at reduced pion mass via the formation of an axion condensate.  Answering the question of whether an axion with a mass at the QCD prediction could condense in neutron stars hinges on a number of fundamental questions in nuclear physics, including the properties of three nucleon forces, the importance of light resonances neglected in chiral EFT, fine tuning in s-wave scattering, and at what density chiral symmetry restoration occurs in cold nuclear matter.  In this talk, I will present our current research on pion mass dependence in chiral EFT, possible observable signatures in neutron stars, and what the study of pion mass dependence can teach us about extant theoretical problems in low energy nuclear physics.\n\nSource: Duke University",

Drawing from DAWG's framework From Reflection to Release, she will discuss why accountable filmmaking must center participants, reject auteur myths, and embrace justice, dignity, and collective practice, principles that guided the development of the DAWG Syllabus and continue to anchor her work.\n\nAll are welcome - students, scholars, community members and anyone interested in how documentary storytelling supports movements for justice.

DAWG's ethical framework and companion syllabus have become widely used tools across the documentary field. Natalie is also a documentary producer and emerging director, a 2023 Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center Documentary Film Fellow, and a 2023 DOC NYC New Leaders cohort member, with decades of experience in media, education, and justice‑oriented storytelling.\n\nContinuing Education Course Opportunity:\n\nThis free talk is offered through the Duke Center for Documentary Studies Continuing Education Program.

    "description": "Data Science Raleigh\nMany enterprises believe they’re ready for AI once models are selected, platforms are deployed, and pilots are underway. But in practice, AI initiatives often stall before reaching production—or they underperform once they do. The root cause? The data isn’t actually ready.\n\nIn this thought-leadership session, Naveen Punjabi from Google Cloud and Jake Bengtson from Striim unpack four critical signs that your data foundation can actually support AI at scale. Drawing from real-world customer patterns, we’ll explore why centralized data isn’t enough, how invisible data errors derail AI outcomes, and why stale data threatens use cases like RAG and AI agents.\n\nWhat we'll cover:\n\n* What Google Cloud is seeing across enterprise AI adoption—and where data readiness tends to break down\n* Four practical indicators your data is ready for trustworthy, production-grade AI\n* Why validation and accuracy matter before any models get involved\n* How real-time pipelines give AI access to operational truth\n* How Google Cloud and Striim help enterprises move from AI experimentation to enterprise impact\n\nThis session is built for data, analytics, and AI leaders ready to move beyond AI experimentation—and build foundations that truly support scale.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Spot the Warning Signs:** Know when your data might silently sabotage your AI initiatives.\n\n2️⃣ **Go Beyond Centralization:** Why a data lake isn’t the same as a data strategy.\n\n3️⃣ **Enable Live AI:** How real-time pipelines can unlock true operational intelligence.\n\n4️⃣ **Validate Early, Scale Confidently:** Why data quality must be addressed before model deployment.\n\n5️⃣**Learn from the Field:** What Google Cloud and Striim have seen across real enterprise AI journeys.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q0417jxY0)**\n\nSource: Meetup: Data Science Raleigh",

We will learn how to distinguish between methodological strategies and technological tactics, i.e. why researchers must first know how they want to work with their data before choosing the best tools to do so. We will then discuss the current ‘state of play’ regarding the various genres of AI-assist technologies available to qualitative researchers and how to select the most appropriate platform. We will then design and implement an “AI-assisted workflow” for managing and analyzing data using MAXQDA. Finally, we will discuss best practices for how to report the use of AI in research studies (Lester & Paulus, forthcoming) and how to reflexively consider the consequences of doing so.\nSample interview data will be used for the practice exercises with discussion around the use of other types of qualitative data. Workshop time will alternate between short lectures and demonstrations, small group discussions, practical hands-on activities, and application of principles learned to the participants’ own research studies and data.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

    "description": "**Attending teachers will receive a FREE copy of Sarah Keys Evans: The Power of Quiet Courage , written by Amy Nathan with illustrations by Jermaine Powell**\n\nK-12 teachers are invited to join the NC Department of Natural & Cultural Resources (DNCR) for a virtual conversation about a less-known North Carolina trailblazer, Sarah Keys Evans. In 1952, as a young Black Army private returning home to Washington, NC, she refused to give up her seat on an interstate bus stopped in Roanoke Rapids, NC, leading to a landmark case that helped end segregation in interstate travel. Her courageous stand (three years before Rosa Parks) helped pave the way for civil rights.\n\nDuring the virtual event, will be have a conversation by Amy Nathan, author of DNCR’s new children’s book Sarah Keys Evans: The Power of Quiet Courage, as we explore why Mrs. Evan’s story matters. We’ll also be joined by Christie Norris, Director of Education for DNCR, and Alex Brown, Director of Programs and Audience Engagement for DNCR’s NC Museum of Art - Winston Salem, to explore ways to bring this powerful history, story, and its accompanying art into your classroom.\n\nTeachers who attend for the full-hour event on Feb. 19 will be mailed a FREE copy of the book after the event. An accompanying lesson plan will also be shared. CEUs (.1) are also available upon request for attendees.\n\nWho Should Attend?\nAny K-12 teacher (public, private or charter) in North Carolina! While Sarah Keys Evans: The Power of Quiet Courage is written for grades 4 – 5, the book can be utilized in most any grade – and every North Carolina student should know the story of Sarah Keys Evans. The stunning illustrations by Jermaine Powell also provide ample classroom connections for any grade. \n\nHow to Register\nSign-up for free using this short form.\n\nEvent Logistics\nYou will receive a Zoom link in February at the e-mail you provide in your registration. Please do not share the Zoom link and instead share the registration link with others interested in participating. \n\nPost-event, teachers in attendance (public, private and charter) will be mailed a FREE copy of the book at the mailing address you provide. A school e-mail address must be provided for confirmation of your status as a teacher.\n\nYou will be able to ask questions via chat during the event.\n\nSponsors & Additional Resources\nThis event is provided by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources' Office of K-12 Education.

    "description": "The 2026 Buchdahl Lecture will focus on over 300,000 years of human history, using the stories of our ancestors and Indigenous cultures to show how we have survived climate change, war, diseases and countless other challenges. We will explore the story of Egypt's so-called Old Kingdom collapse in 2200 BCE, learning how that time period is a mirror for life today and how societies respond to concurrent crises.  The archaeological site of el Lisht, Egypt's capital from the Middle Kingdom (1800 BCE), will provide a case study for what might be possible following a period of multiple crises. What we will learn is that the imminent societal collapse promoted by countless tech bros and podcasters is simply a lie. Our ancestors nearly became extinct almost a million years ago, and yet, they persisted, evolving into homo sapiens. Our human story is one of survival and hope. A better world is possible, with the road well-lit via evidence from the archaeological evidence and Indigenous wisdom.\n\nSource: NC State University",

In the winter garden, structure replaces color, shadows grow longer, and the smallest details become the most expressive. Together, we’ll explore how to photograph bare branches, seed heads, textures, frost patterns, muted palettes, and the striking geometry that emerges when the garden rests. Through guided exercises and intentional seeing practices, you’ll learn to work with low winter light, embrace simplicity, and create images that reflect the stillness and poetry of the season. Perfect for photographers who want to expand their visual awareness and find beauty in the subtle, overlooked moments of winter. All cameras and lenses appropriate from smart phones to digital single lens reflex and mirrorless. \n  \nRegister Here\n\nSource: NC Botanical Garden",

    "description": "Join us for Rivers and Resistance: Freedom Seeking in Eastern NC, a transformative, place-based workshop designed for middle and high school teachers.\n\n·       Virtual Event Kick Off (via Zoom) on Thursday, March 26 (5 PM - 7:30 PM)\n·       Immersive Learning in Eastern NC Friday, April 10 - Sunday, April 12, 2026  \n \nAPPLICATION DEADLINE is February 22\n \nEvent Overview\nThroughout North Carolina's early history, many enslaved people carved out freedom for themselves, some using the waterways, swamps, and diverse landscapes of eastern North Carolina as pathways to liberation. This immersive weekend experience will highlight the courageous acts of resistance and resilience by those who escaped or aided others in their journey to freedom.\n \nParticipants will explore the historical significance of key sites, including DNCR's Somerset Place and Historic Edenton, delving into the stories of enslaved people like Harriet Jacobs and many others. Through interaction with top scholars, tours, discussions, and hands-on activities, the workshop will weave together history and science, connecting the natural ecology of the region—its rivers, swamps, and forests—with the survival strategies of freedom seekers.\n \nAttendees will also have the unique opportunity to canoe the very waterways enslaved people navigated, offering an immersive experience in the natural environment that shaped their journeys. Guided by DNCR's NC Museum of Natural Sciences, teachers will gain insights into the region’s ecosystems and learn how waterways and landscapes influenced the history, culture and experiences of freedom seekers. \n\nIn addition to examining the physical landscapes of resistance, we will explore cultural strategies of survival and freedom, such as the role of foodways in sustaining communities. We will be joined by Adé Carrena, an award-winning chef, culinary artist, storyteller, and filmmaker, who will guide us through the rich tapestry of Southern culinary traditions and their deep roots in African diasporic culture. As she leads our group in preparing a shared meal, participants will experience firsthand how recipes became vessels of memory and resilience.\n\nEqually powerful is the role of music and spirituals, songs that served as both comfort and covert communication, embedding directions and encouragement within their melodies. Acclaimed scholar and singer Mary D. Williams will join us for a private performance sharing some of the spirituals that were a source of strength through generations. These cultural practices were not mere expressions of creativity; they were acts of quiet defiance, sustaining hope and forging pathways to liberation.\n \nTeachers will leave with new perspectives on integrating history, culture, science, and nature into comprehensive lessons, as well as strategies for teaching the history of slavery and freedom seeking in effective and responsible ways.\n \nAttending educators will receive:\n\n2.0 CEUs (with the completion of pre-readings) Overnight accommodations (Friday and Saturday evening) at the Eastern 4-H Center and meals Private access to key historic sites such as Historic Edenton and Somerset Place.A guided paddle (via canoe) along the Cashie River, with a focus on nature and the environmental factors that shaped the experiences of enslaved people. Discussions on the intersections of history, nature, and science in the regionA virtual keynote by Dr. Antwain Hunter, UNC-Chapel HillA hands-on foodways workshop and lunch with Adé Carrena, an award-winning chef, culinary artist, storyteller, and filmmakerA private performance by Mary D. Williams that focuses on the role of music in the resistance and resilience of enslaved peopleResources and strategies for teaching about slavery, resistance, freedom, and resilience. \nApplication and Requirements\nApplications are open to teachers of all disciplines in grades 6-12 who evidence in their application how this experience directly connects with their work in the classroom.\n \nSpace is limited to 16 teachers; filling out this application does not guarantee your registration. Selections will be made based on the responses provided, as well as ensuring representation from multiple grades, subject areas, and geographies. \n \nPriority will be given to applications from cross-disciplinary teams of two or more teachers from the same school who apply (e.g., a social studies teacher and a science teacher from the same school interested in teaching this content across curriculums) Registrants who have not previously participated in a workshop provided by the hosting organizations will also receive preference. \n \nApplicants must be currently employed full-time in a North Carolina public school (including public charters), teaching at least 50% in person, and must make clear in their responses how they will utilize this experience back in the classroom. \nBefore submitting an application, please ensure you can participate in the virtual kick-off on Thurs. March 26 at 5:30 PM, arrive at Somerset Place by 4 PM on Friday, April 10, and that you can attend all portions of the agenda until 11 AM on Sunday, April 12.

Late arrivals and early departures cannot be accommodated. \n \nYou will know that your application was submitted when you receive an auto-message noting such. (We recommend keeping a local copy of your responses before submitting.) If you are unsure your application was submitted, you can e-mail educationoutreach@dncr.nc.gov for a confirmation.\n \nYou should receive a response to your application no later than March 9. (Please hold the dates until that point.)

If you are accepted and at any point find that you are no longer able to participate, it is critical that you provide ample notice of cancellation. Failure to do so prevents other teachers on the wait list from participating and results in waste of food, accommodations, and other resources. Teachers who do not cancel and do not show up may have their school billed for a \"no show\" fee of $100.\n \nQuestions?\nContact christie.norris@dncr.nc.gov. \n\nAPPLY HERE: Rivers and Resistance APPLICATION\n \nThis workshop is a collaboration between the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR) divisions/programs (including the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the America 250 NC initiative, Division of Historic Sites) and Carolina K-12.

In addition to the notable people and places highlighted by the artwork (including artists John Biggers and Jim Biggers, athletes Sleepy Floyd and James Worthy, Highland High School, Big Daddy's, and the Elks Lodge), are everyday folks, charitable organizations, and businesses, who together make up the fabric of this vibrant community.\n\nThis artwork will also have a digital component managed by Gaston County Museum of Art, with ongoing contributions from volunteers, community members, and Highland School of Technology students, to assure the piece continues to educate into the future.\n\nSpecial thanks to members of Highland Neighborhood Association, The City of Gastonia, Erwin Center Park Staff, Project Manager Carl Harris, Gaston County Museum of Art and History, Highland School of Technology, and Kintegra Health for their partnership and support in managing and completing this project — the largest and most significant piece of public art in Gaston County.

    "description": "“… one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”\n\n \n\nIn this compelling and interactive presentation, scholar and playwright Dr. Sonny Kelly weaves together storytelling, lecture, poetry, and dramatic interpretation to confront the painful and persistent legacies that continue to shape American life.This free public event takes place on Sunday, February 22, 2026 from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at The Friday Center, 100 Friday Center Dr. in Chapel Hill; registration is required.\n\n \n\nTracing a powerful thread from the colonial era to the present day, Dr. Kelly brings to life pivotal figures such as Crispus Attucks, Frederick Douglass, and Fred Hampton, illuminating how their struggles and leadership speak directly to the divisions we face today. With insight and urgency, he asks the central questions: How did we get where we are, and what can history teach us about where we go next?\n\n \n\nIndivisible reveals a too-often overlooked American story – one marked not only by oppression, but by enduring hope, resilience, and the pursuit of unity. This is a story that challenges us to listen deeply, reflect honestly, and take up the baton from past leaders to help build a more just and indivisible nation.\n\n \n\nMore than a performance, Indivisible is an experience. Dr. Sonny Kelly embodies 20 distinct characters, guiding audiences through unforgettable stories that span generations. With an exceptional ability to connect, educate, and inspire, Dr. Kelly invites audiences into a safe and courageous space – one that encourages honest engagement with difficult truths, exploration of shared humanity, and the pursuit of healing and unity.\n\n\n\n\nIndivisible offers audiences an experience that:\n\nBrings American history vividly to life through interactive theater, storytelling, and dramatic interpretation.Illuminates overlooked voices and pivotal figures whose legacies shaped…and continue to shape our nation’s story.Encourages reflection and dialogue about unity, division, and the meaning of justice in America today.Engages both heart and mind, blending scholarship with powerful live performance.Inspires hope, resilience, and connection across generations and communities.Creates a welcoming space for thoughtful community conversation.Join us for an insightful, moving, and inspiring Black History Month experience.\nRegistration is required to attend. Event is free and open to the public, and recommended for school grades 3 and up/ages 10 and up.\n\n \n\nCampus Life Experience (CLE) credits are available to UNC students via https://heellife.unc.edu/\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

The first session on Monday will be a general overview and introduction to the benefits of Open Source GIS in general, to QGIS in specific, and will include our first hands-on session with QGIS. Topics to be covered include: the QGIS user interface, loading vector and raster files, QGIS plug-ins, web mapping functions, QGIS data manipulation, icons and pull-down tools, basic data manipulation, working with attribute tables, and general familiarity with QGIS. \n\nPart 2 on Wednesday will continue our work with QGIS, including using the vector, raster, and web analysis functions, using the print composer.  We will also cover the QGIS website, tutorials, listserv, discussion groups, sources of help, etc. \n\nPart 3 on Friday will focus on the GRASS GIS and other advanced tools available through the QGIS Processing Toolbox within the QGIS interface. Topics covered will include the GRASS vector and raster data formats, GRASS vector, raster, and imagery analysis, GRASS 3-D data (voxels), the raster map calculator, the print composer, and other GRASS capabilities. You can attend just the first, first two, or all dates.\n\n \n\nLaptops are required for this course, no computers are in the room. Students should download QGIS (www.qgis.org) before the class, and will download the sample data and tutorials (QGIS includes a current version of GRASS) at the start of the class. QGIS runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. At the end of the course, students will have a general ability to use QGIS and GRASS, and can continue learning on their own using the data and tutorials provided.\n\n \n\nIt is highly recommended to bring your power cords, extension cord, and/or powerstrips for your laptops. Come early if you need assistance loading QGIS. Feel free to contact the instructor at: madrys@email.unc.edu\n\n \n\nThis workshop is offered by the University Libraries and will be led by Dr. Scott Madry, with support from library staff, Gracie Riehm and Philip McDaniel. \n\n \n\nNOTE: This workshop will be held in-person ONLY in Davis Library, room 246.

In addition to this, participants will be able to learn how to analyze community issues, develop skills necessary for finding and advocating community issues that they are passionate about, practice collaborating across diverse perspectives, and design realistic initiatives that are grounded in social responsibility and community mobilization. These approaches can lead to increased effective, efficient, and relevant solutions that are deeply rooted in the needs of the community and its members while driving meaningful change.\n\nPresenters:\n\nTiffany Jones Student Leadership Coordinator SLL/THVBethany Daniel Student Leadership Coordinator SLL/THVKayla Cooper Student Leadership Coordinator SLL/THV\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

This course will take you below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thrive. By delving into the chemistry, the biology and the physics that drive soil health and fertility, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a richer, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five-week course, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil science and how to apply them in practical, gardener-friendly ways. You’ll explore how soils behave — how texture, structure and compaction influence water movement, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on sampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along the way, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutrition, exploring how nutrients move through the soil, how fertilizers work and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether you’re troubleshooting problem areas, establishing new garden beds or simply eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet, this course will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow stronger, more resilient plants.\n\nSource: NC State University",

To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting.

From responses to adversity and change, to celebrations of cultural heritage, the works on display will show how art captures, or was influenced by, the complexity of the American experience.\n\nThe show invites both artists and audiences to reflect on:\n\nHow historical events inspire creative expressionThe power of art and handicraft as a storytelling mediumThe inclusion of perspectives often missing from familiar narrativesThe ways resilience, identity, and innovation converge to shape our futureAs part of the program, America 250 NC will present a One Day Wonder traveling exhibit “To Preserve the Blessings of Liberty: State Constitutions of North Carolina.” Featuring copies of the 1776 State Constitution and Declaration of Rights, the 1868 State Constitution, and a letter from John Adams known as “Thoughts on Government,” the exhibit explores North Carolina’s three state constitutions and key amendments, examining how they reshaped ideas of citizenship and expanded, or restricted, participation in the state’s political life.

I can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hidden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded people so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers with shop-hating history buffs, or long distance hikers with casual strollers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO trips, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/deny as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to get a hint of what one might see. No guarantees of ANYTHING! China changes very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the beaten track. I said 'adventure'!\n\n\\*\\*Sometimes western comforts are just not there. Deep in the countryside villages rarely have western toilets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Quick change of plans is relative in China; western expectations are best set aside and an embrace the new/unknown/surprise attitude is highly recommended. But that's what a cultural adventure is all about!\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh & Triangle Activities",

The first session on Monday will be a general overview and introduction to the benefits of Open Source GIS in general, to QGIS in specific, and will include our first hands-on session with QGIS. Topics to be covered include: the QGIS user interface, loading vector and raster files, QGIS plug-ins, web mapping functions, QGIS data manipulation, icons and pull-down tools, basic data manipulation, working with attribute tables, and general familiarity with QGIS. \n\nPart 2 on Wednesday will continue our work with QGIS, including using the vector, raster, and web analysis functions, using the print composer.  We will also cover the QGIS website, tutorials, listserv, discussion groups, sources of help, etc. \n\nPart 3 on Friday will focus on the GRASS GIS and other advanced tools available through the QGIS Processing Toolbox within the QGIS interface. Topics covered will include the GRASS vector and raster data formats, GRASS vector, raster, and imagery analysis, GRASS 3-D data (voxels), the raster map calculator, the print composer, and other GRASS capabilities. You can attend just the first, first two, or all dates.\n\n \n\nLaptops are required for this course, no computers are in the room. Students should download QGIS (www.qgis.org) before the class, and will download the sample data and tutorials (QGIS includes a current version of GRASS) at the start of the class. QGIS runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. At the end of the course, students will have a general ability to use QGIS and GRASS, and can continue learning on their own using the data and tutorials provided.\n\n \n\nIt is highly recommended to bring your power cords, extension cord, and/or powerstrips for your laptops. Come early if you need assistance loading QGIS. Feel free to contact the instructor at: madrys@email.unc.edu\n\n \n\nThis workshop is offered by the University Libraries and will be led by Dr. Scott Madry, with support from library staff, Gracie Riehm and Philip McDaniel. \n\n \n\nNOTE: This workshop will be held in-person ONLY in Davis Library, room 246.

    "description": "Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith increased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come increased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within individuals. Additionally, technological advances have made the collection of person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interested in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day course focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individuals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time series data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily diary data; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary sampling (ESM); passive data from cell phones; and other psychophysiological data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling frameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore processes as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-specific network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between methods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during this course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFitting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches for summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling frameworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to give learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

As Ms. Joyner states, \" “Hand sewing is becoming a dying art, but there are many benefits to the art form.  You’re using your hands and eyes in coordination, which is great practice for other activities. You’re also working on fine motor skills, which can be helpful for tasks like handwriting and using a computer mouse.  But the best thing about hand sewing is that it’s a relaxing activity. When you’re focusing on the task at hand, you can forget about all of your troubles and just enjoy the moment. Sometimes it’s nice to take a break from thinking about things and just work on something creative.  So let’s learn how to create a handmade doll similar to the primitive dolls made by the enslaved women of Colonial Williamsburg.” \n\nThe activity will take place in Rosedale's kitchen cellar, and seating is limited to 15. Materials will be provided.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

    "description": "Department of Art and Art History\n\n \n\n“Like the Dawn of Creation: Byzantine Fragments in the Modern Imagination”\n\n \n\nThis talk explores how Byzantium operates as a queer cipher in modern culture, appearing as an adjectival modifier, “the Byzantine,” rather than as a distinct historical referent. Analyzing Gore Vidal’s 1959 adaptation of Tennessee Williams’s Suddenly, Last Summer, Betancourt demonstrates how Byzantine references encode queer identity through the film’s absent protagonist, whose unspeakable sexuality mirrors Byzantium’s own unintelligibility. Drawing on extensive archival research, he shows how “the Byzantine” articulated coded queerness for these writers and artists. This talk proposes reimagining Byzantine art history through modes of “queer fragmentation,” recognizing Byzantine elements across temporal boundaries.\n\n \n\nRoland Betancourt is a scholar of Byzantium and modern popular culture with research that lies firmly at the intersection of the history of science and technology, intellectual history, and the history of art. Dr. Betancourt is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC from 2024-2026. He also holds the honor of Chancellor’s Professor, Department of Art History, at the University of California, Irvine. He is also the author of four monographs, including The Secrets We Keep: Hidden Histories of the Byzantine Empire (The Getty, 2024), Performing the Gospels in Byzantium: Sight, Sound, and Space in the Divine Liturgy (Cambridge University Press, 2021), Byzantine Intersectionality: Sexuality, Gender, and Race in the Middle Ages (Princeton University Press, 2020), and Sight, Touch, and Imagination in Byzantium (Cambridge University Press, 2018). Betancourt’s forthcoming book, Disneyland and the Rise of Automation: How Technology Created the Happiest Place on Earth (Princeton University Press, 2026), traces the origins and evolution of the theme park’s technical innovations during Disneyland’s first three decades in operation, exploring how engineers reimagined the systems and machines of industrial manufacturing and the military.\n\n \n\nA weeknight or daytime permit is now required after 5:00 pm on weekdays.

Our sounds, most notably the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound, are known for their stunning coastal landscapes, immense biodiversity, historical significance, economic importance, and are the largest estuarine system in the nation managed by one state. Estuaries, sometimes described as “rainforests of the sea”, are crucial because they filter pollutants, provide critical nurseries for fish and shellfish (supporting fisheries), as well as economic benefits through recreation, tourism, and jobs, all while supporting immense biodiversity. Our shallow sounds are in deep trouble for several reasons, not the least of which is our fisheries management. It’s not too late to recognize and to cherish North Carolina’s natural treasures for the gift they are and undertake-with dogged determination-the effort to restore their abundance, for humans and the environment. Restoration is not a pipe dream; it is just waiting for us to get on board.  \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation",

How did the Declaration go from being a congressional PR document of moderate significance to becoming the defining document of American history and one of the most influential documents in the history of the world.\n\nThough it served an important purpose in 1776, the Declaration was not particularly noted or celebrated in the decades after the Revolution.\n\nIn this talk, historian Michael D. Hattem will discuss how groups from across the political spectrum have redefined the Declaration and its ideals in an effort to make them more relevant and meaningful to their own times. In the process, he will show how the Declaration became \"American Scripture,\" as well as a model for independence-seeking people around the world.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

    "description": "Knowing how to develop various types of qualitative research studies to respond to complex research and community priorities is rewarding, but can also be daunting. This short course provides practical skills for conducting various types of qualitative research in U.S. and international settings. First, students will learn about the epistemological and theoretical foundations of qualitative research and the range of methodologies currently used such as programmatic qualitative research, ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, and case studies. Next, the short course provides step-by-step instructions on how to develop and implement various qualitative methods and designs, such as interviews, focus groups, and observations – and how to handle single- versus multi-method qualitative studies or cross-sectional versus longitudinal qualitative studies. Students will learn basic principles for data generation, ethics, and data quality in qualitative studies. We will also focus on practical steps for data analysis, including data management, transcription, and coding. Traditionally, qualitative research is conducted in-person, and students will be trained for in-person interactions. However, the short course’s concluding module teaches students about techniques required for contemporary qualitative research online and by phone, including consideration of recent advances in conducting qualitative research using social media. This course is designed to provide new knowledge for both introductory and intermediate students. Registration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

    "description": "This Heels masterclass begins with a grounding, yoga-inspired, and somatic warm-up to help you drop into your body, breathe deeply, and cultivate presence and find strength. From there, we’ll move into playful, beginner-friendly choreography and across the floor exercises in heels, exploring movement practices designed to awaken your sensuality and confidence. We will dive into a group choreography session toward the end of class. This is a space to move with intention, embody authenticity, and connect with your body in a way that feels bold, beautiful, and free. It is recommended to bring the following: a journal for reflections, dancing heels you feel confident and comfortable in, and a water bottle. \n\n \n\nArtist Bio: Anabelle Scarborough is a dancer, choreographer, educator, and visual artist based on the East Coast, currently based in the Raleigh–Durham region of North Carolina. Raised in the Appalachian Mountains, her work is deeply informed by themes of beauty, femininity, spontaneity, improvisation, and community. She trained at the Martha Graham School in New York City and at UNC Chapel Hill, studying modern, contemporary, improvisation, composition, ballet, and heels. She is a 200-hour certified yoga instructor through the Asheville Yoga Center and is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at Wake Forest University. Together, these experiences inform a holistic, trauma-informed approach to movement that honors both emotional and physical wellbeing. Anabelle is currently a Guest Teaching Artist at North Carolina State University's Department of Performing Arts and Technology. Working at the intersection of art, healing, and community, Anabelle’s interdisciplinary practice spans dance, yoga, photography, film, and arts-based education. \n\nHer projects reimagine how performance can activate and transform shared spaces, inviting audiences into intimate, participatory experiences that emphasize presence, connection, and collective storytelling.

    "description": "The Abbey Speaker Series marks the 250th anniversary of American independence with a discussion of Race and the American Founding at 5:30pm on Thursday, February 26 in the Frank Porter Graham Student Union Auditorium.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence proclaimed equality —”all men are created equal”—but the Constitution tolerated slavery. Abolitionists, Abraham Lincoln, and civil rights leaders later wielded the Declaration’s words, but its principal author, Thomas Jefferson, owned slaves, and the Declaration refers to Native Americans as “merciless savages.” How should we think about this founding paradox that has haunted the nation for 250 years? Historian Annette Gordon-Reed and political theorist Lucas Morel will explore these and related issues in a discussion moderated by Carolina Public Humanities Executive Director Max Owre.\n\nStudents who attend in person can earn CLE credit. No tickets necessary; seating is first-come, first-served. Reserved tickets are available for guests coming from outside Chapel Hill; email publicdiscourse@unc.edu to reserve seats.\n\nJoin us for pizza in the lobby afterward!\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

It's a bit smaller group than the large Monday night extravaganza, and there are a lot of drop in and independent groups here as well. Restaurants are open on Thursdays, so you can Dash you food right inside, or bring it with you!\n\nMoondog has an extensive and ever-changing collection of games that are usually loaned out for a fee, but on Thursdays (just like on Mondays), they are all free to play. Usually we can find folks to fill in your table or teach you the basics of the games. I've been hosting it for a few months now, and we have had a great time with students returning and bringing in new colleagues, as well as the faithful ones who attended over the summer.\n\nDogs and outside food both allowed and encouraged. Always free! There is award-winning mead on tap and bottled, as well as an ever-changing collection of beer, cider, THC-infused water, colas and, yes, just plain old water to keep you hydrated on your adventure.\n\nAny questions? Contact us here at Durham Geeks!\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Geeks",

    "description": "Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith increased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come increased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within individuals. Additionally, technological advances have made the collection of person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interested in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day course focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individuals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time series data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily diary data; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary sampling (ESM); passive data from cell phones; and other psychophysiological data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling frameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore processes as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-specific network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between methods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during this course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFitting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches for summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling frameworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to give learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

Essentially, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality, meaning our relationship with time, not subject to change? Instead of anachronistic, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachronic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian, Keith Moxey, adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameters of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind, this symposium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdisciplinary reflection on how time is constructed, experienced, and represented across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks, we seek to interrogate whose times are privileged, silenced, or contested, and how alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with temporality to construct new and alternative histories; how meaning and interpretation inevitably shift across time, requiring us to reconsider our own scholarly and curatorial practices; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

From responses to adversity and change, to celebrations of cultural heritage, the works on display will show how art captures, or was influenced by, the complexity of the American experience.\n\nThe show invites both artists and audiences to reflect on:\n\nHow historical events inspire creative expressionThe power of art and handicraft as a storytelling mediumThe inclusion of perspectives often missing from familiar narrativesThe ways resilience, identity, and innovation converge to shape our futureAs part of the program, America 250 NC will present a One Day Wonder traveling exhibit “To Preserve the Blessings of Liberty: State Constitutions of North Carolina.” Featuring copies of the 1776 State Constitution and Declaration of Rights, the 1868 State Constitution, and a letter from John Adams known as “Thoughts on Government,” the exhibit explores North Carolina’s three state constitutions and key amendments, examining how they reshaped ideas of citizenship and expanded, or restricted, participation in the state’s political life.

Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general audience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic, it is often to say that it is contradictory, inconsistent, illogical, or misplaced. Essentially, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality, meaning our relationship with time, not subject to change? Instead of anachronistic, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachronic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian, Keith Moxey, adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameters of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind, this symposium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdisciplinary reflection on how time is constructed, experienced, and represented across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks, we seek to interrogate whose times are privileged, silenced, or contested, and how alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with temporality to construct new and alternative histories; how meaning and interpretation inevitably shift across time, requiring us to reconsider our own scholarly and curatorial practices; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: Ackland Art Museum",

Together, volunteers will focus on removing invasive heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) along the farm’s wooded nature trail. \nHeavenly bamboo poses a threat to local ecosystems as it spreads quickly when birds eat its berries and disperse the seeds, allowing dense thickets to form that crowd out native plants and reduce habitat quality for wildlife. Its berries are also highly toxic, releasing cyanide when eaten, and birds such as cedar waxwings have been known to die after consuming large quantities. \nThis volunteer effort will involve digging, prying, cutting, and lifting plant roots, so participants should be prepared for physical activity. It’s a great opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the trail and the wildlife that depends on it.\n \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation",

Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated, or if that makes you feel most comfortable. We will have masks available if you would like to wear one during an event. We also encourage those eligible to be vaccinated to get their Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. If you are experiencing any Covid-related symptoms, please stay home and attend a program another day. Our top priority is to create a safe environment for our community. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nInclement Weather Policy: In the event of inclement weather, you will be contacted by email for a call on cancellation or postponement. At our Williamson and Brumley South Nature Preserves, due to the multi-use trail systems, we close the trails to the public if there has been rain to try and prevent erosion and detrimental impact. You will also be contacted by email if the event is capable of being held, but the trails are closed.\n\nSource: Triangle Land Conservancy",

Due to the size of the parking lot, we will keep the hiking group small and ask that you register by vehicle rather than individual. Feel free to bring guests but please carpool to ensure we have enough space in the parking lot.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf registration is full, please fill out this waitlist form by February 26th.\n\nCurrent Mask Policy: TLC seeks to build a supportive, mask-friendly environment in all collaborations with staff and the public. Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated, or if that makes you feel most comfortable. We will have masks available if you would like to wear one during an event. We also encourage those eligible to be vaccinated to get their Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. If you are experiencing any Covid-related symptoms, please stay home and attend a program another day. Our top priority is to create a safe environment for our community.

Join JCRA Nursery Technician Sophia McCusker and master's student and former JCRA intern Eileen Gahan as they lead you through the garden, highlighting the plants they love most. From early spring showstoppers already bursting into bloom to dependable favorites that deserve a little more appreciation, this tour is all about personal picks with professional insight.\n\nAnd because it's Ladies' Choice, you can expect a few wild cards on the tour, such as plants that do great in containers and are impossible to kill in the nursery and plants that definitely do not grow in Ireland but seem to do amazing here. \n\nCome see what makes the cut when McCusker and Gahan get to choose their favorites and discover a few new must-have plants for your own garden.\n\nSource: NC State University",

This year’s event, “Retelling Our Story of Aging: Reimagining the Future through Community, Research, and Action,” invites participants to explore a strengths-based, age-positive view of aging and what it will take to support thriving later in life. Spend the day with scholars, community leaders, and storytellers with lived experience as we examine the landscape of older adults in the United States and North Carolina and consider how communities and systems can respond more effectively. The day will be framed by keynote remarks from Kathy Greenlee, who will offer a national perspective on aging and highlight emerging opportunities to strengthen aging supports through collaboration across communities, research, and systems. Lived-experience storytelling and panel discussions will further explore research-informed practices, policy and system factors, and practical approaches for building more inclusive, age-friendly communities. Don’t miss this engaging event focused on shifting narratives about aging, strengthening community supports, and identifying actions we can take — individually and collectively — to shape a future where people can thrive as they age.

Despite its significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion.\n\nTo bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA can generate diverse, realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Zhiyang (Frank) Dou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiyang-frank-dou-0259111b3/) is a Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by Prof. Wojciech Matusik. I work with the Computational Design and Fabrication Group and the Computer Graphics Group.\n\n**Securing the Autonomous Future: Navigating the Intersection of Agentic AI, Connected Devices, and Cyber Resilience**\n\nWith billions of devices now in our infrastructure and emerging as autonomous agents (AI), we face a very real question: How can we create intelligent systems that are both secure and trusted? This talk will explore the intersection of agentic AI and IoT and demonstrate how the same AI systems can provide robust defense mechanisms. At its core, however, this is a challenge about trusting people with technology, ensuring their safety, and providing accountability. Therefore, creating a new way of thinking is required, one in which security is built in, and where autonomous action has oversight; and, ultimately, innovation leads to greater human well-being.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Samaresh Kumar Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samaresh-singh-9772ba23/) is an engineering principal at HP Inc. with more than 21 years of experience in designing and implementing large-scale distributed systems, cloud native platform systems, and edge AI / ML systems. His expertise includes agentic AI systems, GenAI / LLMs, Edge AI, federated and privacy preserving learning, and secure hybrid cloud / edge computing.\n\n**Plugins as Products: Bringing Visual AI Research into Real-World Workflows with FiftyOne**\n\nVisual AI research often introduces new datasets, models, and analysis methods, but integrating these advances into everyday workflows can be challenging. FiftyOne is a data-centric platform designed to help teams explore, evaluate, and improve visual AI, and its plugin ecosystem is how the platform scales beyond the core. In this talk, we explore the FiftyOne plugin ecosystem from both perspectives: how users apply plugins to accelerate data-centric workflows, and how researchers and engineers can package their work as plugins to make it easier to share, reproduce, and build upon. Through practical examples, we show how plugins turn research artifacts into reusable components that integrate naturally into real-world visual AI workflows.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Adonai Vera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adonai-vera/) \\- Machine Learning Engineer & DevRel at Voxel51\\. With over 7 years of experience building computer vision and machine learning models using TensorFlow\\, Docker\\, and OpenCV\\.\n\n**Transforming Business with Agentic AI**\n\nAgentic AI is reshaping business operations by employing autonomous systems that learn, adapt, and optimize processes independently of human input. This session examines the essential differences between traditional AI agents and Agentic AI, emphasizing their significance for project professionals overseeing digital transformation initiatives. Real-world examples from eCommerce, insurance, and healthcare illustrate how autonomous AI achieves measurable outcomes across industries. The session addresses practical orchestration patterns in which specialized AI agents collaborate to resolve complex business challenges and enhance operational efficiency. Attendees will receive a practical framework for identifying high-impact use cases, developing infrastructure, establishing governance, and scaling Agentic AI within their organizations.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Joyjit Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royjoyjit/) is a senior technology and program management leader with over 21 years of experience delivering enterprise digital transformation, cloud modernization, and applied AI programs across insurance, financial services, and global eCommerce.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision",

    "description": "Data Science Raleigh\nAs AI adoption accelerates, many enterprises are hitting the same wall: traditional approaches to data governance, metadata management, and cataloging were not designed to support AI and AI agents operating at scale. Fragmented tools, siloed semantics, and inconsistent definitions make it difficult for both people and AI systems to trust and act on data.\n\nIn this webinar, industry expert Mike Ferguson and Collate co-founder and CEO Suresh Srinivas explore how leading organizations are evolving from tool-centric data catalogs and governance toward semantic intelligence, a unified approach that brings governance, context, and meaning together to support analytics, automation, and AI at scale.\n\nCollate co-founder and CTO Harsha Chintalapani will also provide a brief demonstration showing how semantic intelligence is applied in practice, including how data teams design and build AI agents on governed enterprise data.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ Why data discovery, governance, lineage, and data quality and observability must work together to support AI-driven use cases\n\n2️⃣ How fragmented semantic layers and tool-specific context limit trust, scale, and reuse across analytics and AI\n\n3️⃣What semantic intelligence means in practice and how it extends beyond traditional data catalogs\n\n4️⃣How shared meaning enables secure, governed access to data for both people and AI agents\n\n5️⃣How semantic intelligence supports the delivery of trusted, consumable data products with meaning, quality signals, and governance that are ready for analytics and AI agents\n\n6️⃣What it takes to make data truly AI-ready without sacrificing control, compliance, or consistency\n\nDesigned for data leaders, enterprise architects, and governance teams, this session explains why existing catalogs and governance tools remain useful—but are no longer sufficient on their own—and how enterprises can operationalize shared meaning to support analytics, data engineering, and AI initiatives at scale.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042D1NJ0)**\n\nSource: Meetup: Data Science Raleigh",

The session will begin with intermediate barre work, starting at plies and finishing with grand battements. Center exercises and across-the-floor combinations that will incorporate a mix of adagio, turning combinations and jumping will also be part of the session.\n\nBéres was born in Hungary and began his dance training in 1996 at age 11 when he was accepted into the Hungarian National Dance Academy. During his education, Béres was one of the four students chosen to perform with the Hungarian National Ballet. He was an apprentice in the company from age 14 until he graduated from the school in 2005. During his nine years of education, he had the privilege of training under many great teachers, including Zoltan Solymosi, who was a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet. Beres has performed in several countries in Europe, including Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria and Italy. After graduation, he was offered a full scholarship with the North Carolina Dance Theatre in Charlotte, which brought him to the United States. He has danced with the Hungarian National Ballet, Slovak State Opera House, New Jersey Ballet and Carolina Ballet. He has performed several soloist and principal roles, including Firebird, Swan Lake, Don Quixote and many more. He retired as a soloist with Carolina Ballet in 2017 after dancing with the company for nine years. Béres is currently a full-time ballet teacher.\n\nSource: NC State University",

The session will also delve into collecting evidence of these things through unbiased discovery work.\n\nSession 3 (March 12): You'll learn about the methods entrepreneurs use to rapidly validate demand for what they are working on without spending a lot of money and time.\n\nSession 4 (March 26): With just a few days left before the Andrews Launch Accelerator applications are due on March 31, this session will be an open-floor Q&A on anything related to the Andrews Launch Accelerator, including applications.\n\nSource: NC State University",

Restaurants are open on Thursdays, so you can Dash you food right inside, or bring it with you!\n\nMoondog has an extensive and ever-changing collection of games that are usually loaned out for a fee, but on Thursdays (just like on Mondays), they are all free to play. Usually we can find folks to fill in your table or teach you the basics of the games. I've been hosting it for a few months now, and we have had a great time with students returning and bringing in new colleagues, as well as the faithful ones who attended over the summer.\n\nDogs and outside food both allowed and encouraged. Always free! There is award-winning mead on tap and bottled, as well as an ever-changing collection of beer, cider, THC-infused water, colas and, yes, just plain old water to keep you hydrated on your adventure.\n\nAny questions?

    "description": "Broken Beakers and Brilliant Minds: Fixing The Machinery of Science \n\n  \n\nFrom the energy crisis and feeding eight billion people to defeating cancer and coping with climate change, humanity faces some rather large challenges today. To tackle them, we need science running like a well-oiled machine. Unfortunately, it has more often resembled a clunky old engine: loud, temperamental and prone to breaking down at the worst possible moment. \n\n  \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding cuts for science’s current woes, but focusing only on money rather misses the point. Many of science’s biggest problems have been around for years, sometimes centuries. Scientists have long been criticized, sidelined or attacked for having ideas that were too new, too inconvenient or simply too correct for the people in power at the time. Even truly unscientific behaviors, like character assassination and fraud, are not modern inventions… though they do seem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance. \n\n  \n\nThe good news is that longstanding problems are not the same as unsolvable ones. Join Matt Kaplan, science correspondent at The Economist and author of I Told You So! Scientists Who Were Ridiculed, Exiled and Imprisoned… For Being Right, for a spirited and insightful talk on the history of these endemic issues and what we can do to finally consign them to the scientific scrap heap.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile, install the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforthecarolinas.org) or reach out to info@codewiththecarolinas.org\n\nAll activities of Code with the Carolinas, a project of [Social Good Fund](https://www.socialgoodfund.org/), follow our [Code of Conduct](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/0d32d5f905f8fd49d5e80395f8fd47f2b59ce3ef8b335f72/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTkx) and are subject to this [Volunteer Waiver of Liability](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/06dd62200e6b28426b137e0e6b2848fb901487014f72cd16/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTE2).\n\nSource: Meetup: Code with the Carolinas",

Mid January to almost mid February, but it’s time to prepare for the 2026 season of the Tuesday after work bike rides. This seasonal, weekly event has been going on since 2011! It will begin with just over 1 hour of riding, and as the days get longer we’ll increase the ride time and distance tracking sunset.\nWe'll be starting near Southpoint and final starting point will be sent out Monday evening. Make sure that your bike is in good working order - tires hold air and are up to pressure, brakes and shifters work and your chain has been oiled. We'll be riding just about 1 hours and about 12 miles. The ride is fairly flat and shaded and our pace will be moderate (about 13 mph average). I recommend a hard tail or hybrid bike, but if you really want to bring a road bike it's ok, though you'll likely be a bit bored. Unicycles....? I'll be eating after the ride at a restaurant. You're welcome to join me if you like. Helmets are required and by signing up you agree to THOG liability waiver statement. Please Note!! Any cancellation less than 30 hours before the beginning of the event will be considered a \"no show\"\n\nSource: Meetup: Triangle Hiking & Outdoors",

But this shift has created a massive new bottleneck: validation.\n\nHow do you debug a model that imagines the future? How do you curate petabyte-scale video datasets to capture the \"long tail\" of rare events without drowning in storage costs? And how do you ensure temporal consistency when your training data lives in scattered data lakes?\n\nIn this session, we explore technical workflows for the next generation of Visual AI. We will dissect the \"Video Data Monster,\" demonstrating how to build feedback loops that bridge the gap between generative imagination and physical reality. Learn how leading teams are using federated data strategies and collaborative evaluation to turn video from a storage burden into a structured, queryable asset for embodied intelligence.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Nick Lotz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholaslotz/) is chemical process engineer-turned-developer who is currently a Technical Marketing Engineer at Voxel51. He is particularly interested in bringing observability and security to all layers of the AI stack.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision",

From quick dataset validation and preprocessing, to optimal GPU hardware selection, to automated job submission based on metric tracking, to evaluation. Ben will demonstrate how Hugging Face skills can be used to define best practices for agents to support machine learning experiments. Bring Claude, Codex, or Mistral Vibes, and we’ll show you to get it training models with GRPO, SFT, and DPO.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Ben Burtenshaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-burtenshaw/) is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face, focusing on building agents with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. He led educational projects like the Agents Course, the MCP Course, and the LLM course, which bridge the gap between complex Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques and practical application. Ben focuses on democratizing access to efficient AI, empowering the community to align, evaluate, and deploy transparent agentic systems.\n\n**Claude Code Templates**\n\nThis talk explores how to configure and align Claude Code agents using templates and custom components. I'll demonstrate practical configuration patterns that ensure your CLI agent executes exactly what you intend, covering Skills setup, hooks implementation, and template customization. Drawing from real-world examples building Claude Code Templates, attendees will learn how to structure their agent configurations for consistent, reliable behavior and create reusable components that maintain alignment across different use cases.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Daniel Avila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-avila-arias/) is an AI Engineer at Hedgineer building agentic systems and creator of Claude Code Templates.\n\n**Move Faster in Computer Vision by Teaching Agents to See Your Data**\n\nComputer vision teams spend too much time writing scripts just to find bad labels, blurry images, and edge cases. In this talk, I’ll show how to move that work to agents by using FiftyOne as a visual operating system. With Skills and MCP, agents can see inside your datasets, explore them visually, and handle common data cleanup tasks, so you can spend less time on data and more time shipping models.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Adonai Vera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adonai-vera/) \\- Machine Learning Engineer & DevRel at Voxel51\\. With over 7 years of experience building computer vision and machine learning models using TensorFlow\\, Docker\\, and OpenCV\\. I started as a software developer\\, moved into AI\\, led teams\\, and served as CTO\\. Today\\, I connect code and community to build open\\, production\\-ready AI\\, making technology simple\\, accessible\\, and reliable\\.\n\n**Skills As Documentation**\n\nSkills are self-contained recipes - each one a piece of a larger puzzle. Instead of trying to modify human-centric documentation to better fit agents, skills let us build capabilities into our agents directly. This talk will showcase how to think about leveraging skills to enhance how users interact with your software!\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Chris Alexiuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csalexiuk/) is a deep learning developer advocate at NVIDIA, working on creating technical assets that help developers use the incredible suite of AI tools available at NVIDIA. Chris comes from a machine learning and data science background, and he is obsessed with everything and anything about large language models.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision",

Rather than treating malfunction as failure, this symposium frames disruption as a productive site of critical inquiry, care and world-building. Bringing together media studies, rhetoric and critical making, Circuit Breakers foregrounds practices such as improvised infrastructures, technological disobedience, communal repair, Indigenous technological sovereignty, queer glitch and feminist refusal.\n\nThe event will take place at D.H.

Thank you for your support!<br><p>This hike is somewhat difficult and will be off trail, with some bushwhacking and one steep climb. This usually requires about three hours. If there have been recent rains, parts of the trail may be muddy. The hike will lead you to a noteworthy natural area called Willie Duke’s Bluff where you see outstanding displays of spring wildflowers, including some that are rare and unusual in our area of the Piedmont. The site boasts a showy display of spring ephemerals, with extensive areas of Dutchman’s Breeches (Dicentra cucullaria), along with the rare Eastern False Rue Anemone or Isopyrum (Enemion biternatum) and numerous other wildflowers, including Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis), and both Southern or Dimpled Troutlily (Erythronium umbilicatum), and its northern, tetraploid counterpart (E. americanum). The shrub layer consists of Spicebush (Lindera benzoin), Pawpaw (Asimina triloba), and Painted Buckeye (Aesculus sylvatica), which will be in various stages of flowering.</p><p>Wear sturdy shoes and long pants, and bring gloves in case you feel inclined to pull out any invasive Chinese privet seedlings that you might encounter. You will also learn some history and geology along the way.</p><p>Please feel free to bring water and snacks. Well-behaved dogs are welcome as long as they are under your control and on a 6-foot leash.</p><p>This event is rain or shine.

    "description": "Most gardeners are familiar with planting container-grown perennials, but using plugs requires a shift in mindset and technique. These young starter plants, grown in trays instead of pots, offer distinct advantages: they are cost-effective, easier to plant and establish quickly. They are ideal for large areas, slopes and under trees. However, not every gardener is familiar with plugs. Planting them successfully takes a bit of practical know-how that even experienced gardeners will appreciate refining. Join Shannon Currey, education and outreach at Izel Native Plant, to learn the pros and cons of plugs, when they’re most appropriate and best practices for handling, planting and managing them. With these essentials, you’ll be planting like a pro! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

    "description": "Raleigh AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nHear talks from experts on the latest topics in AI, ML, and computer vision on March 19th.\n\n**Date and Location**\n\nMar 19, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/women-in-ai-meetup-march-19-2026)**\n\n**Towards Reliable Clinical AI: Evaluating Factuality, Robustness, and Real-World Performance of Large Language Models**\n\nLarge language models are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, but their reliability remains uncertain—they hallucinate facts, behave inconsistently across instruction phrasings, and struggle with evolving medical terminology. In my talk, I address methods to systematically evaluate clinical LLM reliability across four dimensions aligned with how healthcare professionals actually work: verifying concrete facts (FactEHR), ensuring stable guidance across instruction variations (instruction sensitivity study showing up to 0.6 AUROC variation), integrating up-to-date knowledge (BEACON improving biomedical NER by 15%), and assessing real patient conversations (PATIENT-EVAL revealing models abandon safety warnings when patients seek reassurance). These contributions establish evaluation standards spanning factuality, robustness, knowledge integration, and patient-centered communication, charting a path toward clinical AI that is safer, more equitable, and more trustworthy.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Monica Munnangi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monicamunnangi/) is a doctoral student at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by Saiph Savage. Her doctoral research, which she began in 2021 and expects to complete in 2026, focuses on multi-modal machine learning for healthcare. After being introduced to artificial intelligence and machine learning during her undergraduate studies, Munnangi earned her master’s degree from UMass Amherst.\n\n**Neural BRDFs: Learning Compact Representations for Material Appearance**\n\nAccurately modeling how light interacts with real-world materials remains a central challenge in rendering. Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) describe how materials reflect light as a function of viewing and lighting directions. Creating realistic digital materials has traditionally required choosing between fast parametric models that can't capture real-world complexity, or massive measured BRDFs that are expensive to acquire and store. Neural BRDFs address this challenge by learning continuous reflectance functions from data, exploiting directional correlations and symmetry to achieve significant compression while maintaining rendering quality. In this talk, we examine how neural networks can encode complex material behavior compactly, why this matters for rendering and material capture, and how neural BRDFs fit into the broader evolution toward data-driven graphics.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Manushree Gangwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manushreegangwar/) is a Machine Learning Engineer at Voxel51 working on data-centric visual AI. She holds an MS in Computer Science from Columbia University and has previously worked in robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR, with a focus on scene understanding and 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Supercharging AI agents with evaluations**\n\nReliable deployment of AI agents depends on rigorous evaluation, which must shift from a nice-to-have QA step to a core engineering discipline. Robust evaluation is essential for safety, predictability, misuse resistance, and sustained user trust. To meet this bar, Evals must be deeply integrated into the agent development lifecycle. This talk will outline how simulation-based testing—using high-fidelity, controllable environments—provides the next generation of evaluation infrastructure for production-ready AI agents.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Priya Venkat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priya26/), PhD, is a Senior AI Manager at Intuit, where she leads teams that build and scale ML and Agentic AI systems for finance. Her work integrates cutting-edge agentic workflows and robust evaluation systems to drive business impact while ensuring AI safety and reliability. Priya is a strong advocate of responsible AI, and actively mentors the next generation of AI scientists and engineers.\n\n**Language Diffusion Models**\n\nAutoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). Challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. Optimizing a likelihood bound provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Jayita Bhattacharyya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayita-bhattacharyya) is a AI ML Nerd with a blend of technical speaking & hackathon wizardry! Applying tech to solve real-world problems. The work focus these days is on generative AI.

This session demonstrates how to bridge the gap between CSA Cloud Auditing (CCAK) and practical automation by building a three-stage GRC pipeline in Tines:\n1\\. The Foundation \\(Deterministic\\): We begin by ingesting raw cloud alerts and creating a standardized \"Risk Register using Tines Records\"\\, ensuring every violation is captured without manual entry\\.\n2\\. The Intelligence \\(AI Agent\\): We upgrade the workflow with an AI Agent action\\. Because \"Agents shouldn’t be a black box\"\\, we explicitly instruct it to map alerts to the Cloud Controls Matrix’s \"197 control objectives\" and recommend remediation\\.\n3\\. The Interaction \\(AI Chatbot\\): We conclude by deploying an \"AI interaction layer\"\\. This allows auditors to query their compliance data using natural language \\(e\\.g\\.\\, \"Show me all GDPR risks\"\\)\\, effectively \"unlocking AI’s full value\" for the audit process\n\nSource: Meetup: Cloud Security Alliance Triangle",

Once in the woods there is no defined trail, but the terrain is relatively flat and the vegetation will be growing in and we will do a bit of bushwhacking. This site is one of the significant natural heritage sites recorded on Corps of Engineers land at Falls Lake. The shrub layer consists of spicebush, pawpaw, and painted buckeye, which will be in various stages of flowering. The forest also boasts one of the more expansive populations of Dutchman's breeches and False Rue-anemone in the region. Wear sturdy shoes and long pants, and bring gloves if you are inclined to pull out any invasive Chinese privet seedlings we are likely to encounter.</p><p>During the hike we’ll talk at length about the bedrock geology, soils and soil chemistry, geomorphology and fluvial processes, and cultural history of the site, which also happens to straddle the Indian Trading Path where it crosses the Flat at a natural ford.</p><p>This hike will take approximately two hours (sometimes less, sometimes more). Please feel free to bring water and snacks. Wear comfortable, weather appropriate clothing and shoes. Well-behaved dogs are welcome as long as they are under your control and on a 6 foot leash.</p><p>This event is rain or shine. We will contact you if severe weather is expected that would cause us to cancel the hike.</p><p>If your plans change and you are unable to attend the hike, please contact <a href=\"mailto:education@enoriver.org\" target=\"_blank\">education@enoriver.org</a> to cancel your registration so that we may offer your spot(s) to our waitlist.</p><p><strong><strong>Directions</strong></strong><strong><strong>: We will meet at the Wildlife Subimpoundment parking lot on Old Oxford Highway on the right before Lake Michie Dam Road.

    "description": "All Things AI (Live)\n**Every AI agent is a delegation decision. This workshop teaches you how to make those decisions well.**\n\n[To purchase tickets, visit [https://2026.allthingsai.org/register](https://2026.allthingsai.org/register) workshop tickets also include access to the All Things AI conference on March 24th. ***Price increases after Tuesday, March 17 so sign-up early and save $100*** ]\n\nMany organizations have experimented with AI Agents. Far fewer have moved confidently into sustained, responsible execution.\nAs teams progress from early pilots to real-world deployment, leaders often encounter the same challenges: impressive prototypes that stall before production, uncertainty about where agents actually add value, late-breaking security and governance concerns, and misalignment between business and technical stakeholders about what “success” should look like. Too often, these issues surface only after cost, complexity, or risk have already compounded.\nThis workshop helps leaders make the shift from experimentation to execution—not by pushing agents everywhere, but by providing a clear blueprint for **when agents make sense, when they don’t, and how to make sound decisions when autonomy is on the table**.\n\n***\n\n#### **The Outcome: Better Decisions, Earlier**\n\nBy the end of this session, participants will have more than an overview of AI Agents. They will leave with a **practical decision-making framework** they can apply immediately to real initiatives.\nYou’ll be able to:\n\n* determine whether an agent is appropriate for a given problem—or whether a copilot or traditional automation is the better choice\n* evaluate agent proposals with a clear understanding of autonomy, risk, and tradeoffs\n* anticipate the organizational, architectural, and governance factors that separate successful deployments from stalled experiments\n* identify common failure modes early—while they are still inexpensive to address\n\nThe result is clearer judgment about **what to delegate to agents, what to constrain, and what should remain human**.\n\n***\n\n#### **What the Blueprint Covers**\n\nIn this intensive workshop, business and technical leaders will work through a practical blueprint for AI Agent success, grounded in real-world constraints and leadership realities.\nKey topics include:\n\n* understanding degrees of agency and how they change cost, risk, and accountability\n* distinguishing agents from copilots and traditional automation—and why that distinction matters\n* identifying use cases where agents consistently create value, and scenarios where they introduce unnecessary fragility\n* recognizing common pitfalls that derail agent initiatives, from over-delegation to hidden operational complexity\n* aligning organizational readiness, security, and governance with the level of autonomy being introduced\n\nParticipants will also receive a high-level technical orientation to the AI Agent ecosystem, including platforms, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and model selection tradeoffs. This includes a balanced discussion of the benefits and risks of using Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic workflows, particularly when autonomy and tool access are involved.\n\n***\n\n#### **What You’ll Leave With**\n\nParticipants will leave with:\n\n* A clear framework for deciding **if and when** AI Agents should be used\n* A practical blueprint outlining the conditions required for agent success—and the signals that indicate trouble\n* A realistic understanding of the cost, complexity, and operational demands of agent-based systems\n* Clear guidance for incorporating security, governance, and human oversight from the start\n* A shared language that aligns business and technical leaders around the same decision criteria\n\n***\n\n#### **Who This Is For**\n\nThis workshop is designed for business and technical leaders responsible for turning AI experimentation into operational reality, including:\n\n* Leaders driving digital, AI, or transformation initiatives (e.g., Chief Digital Officers, Heads of AI, Transformation and Digital Strategy leaders)\n* Technology and architecture leaders accountable for execution and scale (e.g., CTOs, CIOs, VPs of Engineering, Enterprise and Solution Architects)\n* Product and innovation leaders shaping AI-enabled capabilities (e.g., CPOs, Heads of Product, Innovation and Emerging Technology leaders)\n* Security, risk, and governance leaders involved in overseeing autonomous or AI-driven systems (e.g., CISOs, Responsible AI and Risk leaders)\n\nThis session is especially valuable for leaders who sit at the intersection of strategy and execution—those expected to decide **when AI Agents should be used, how much authority they should have, and how to govern them responsibly**.\n\n[To purchase tickets, visit [https://2026.allthingsai.org/register](https://2026.allthingsai.org/register) workshop tickets also include access to the All Things AI conference on March 24th. ***Price increases after Tuesday, March 17 so sign-up early and save $100*** ]\n\nSource: Meetup: All Things AI",

However, it is also isolating, biased toward particular kinds of engagement; it is also deeply politically fraught.

In this class, Bryce Lane will bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks, you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving, learning how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile, install the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforthecarolinas.org) or reach out to info@codewiththecarolinas.org\n\nAll activities of Code with the Carolinas, a project of [Social Good Fund](https://www.socialgoodfund.org/), follow our [Code of Conduct](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/0d32d5f905f8fd49d5e80395f8fd47f2b59ce3ef8b335f72/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTkx) and are subject to this [Volunteer Waiver of Liability](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/06dd62200e6b28426b137e0e6b2848fb901487014f72cd16/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTE2).\n\nSource: Meetup: Code with the Carolinas",

    "description": "The Global Film Series will offer a screening of Okko’s Inn.\n\nAfter losing her parents in a car accident, Okko goes to live in the countryside with her grandmother, who runs a traditional Japanese inn built on top of an ancient spring said to have healing waters. While she goes about her chores and prepares to become the inn’s next caretaker, Okko discovers some spirits live there that only she can see — not scary ones but welcoming ghosts who keep her company, play games and help her navigate her new environment. The inn’s motto is that it welcomes all and will reject none, and this is soon put to the test as a string of new guests challenge Okko’s ability to be a gracious host. But ultimately, Okko discovers that dedicating herself to others becomes the key to taking care of herself.\n\nThe film's runtime is 1 hour, 34 minutes. The movie is in Japanese with English subtitles. \n\nThe Global Film Series is a collaboration between the NC State University Libraries and NC State’s Office of Global Engagement. This screening is in partnership with NC State’s Women’s Center in celebration of Women’s History Month.\n\nSource: NC State University",

Next, we have a 5 minute Free-For-All discussion about the work -- then the author may speak.

Trip date TBD - waiting for airfares to come down.\n\nThis will happen on Google Meet.\n\n**CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR MEETING LINK!**\n\n[Comment if you are able to log onto the link but don't see me - in the past Google has let two meetings with the same link open, each person thinking the other didn't show up. So comment here and we'll see if we can fix it. :-) ]\n\nI've been traveling to China for 27 years. Join me for a unique, off the beaten track culture immersion adventure!\n\nComfort NOT guaranteed! LOTS of walking! This trip is NOT for everyone but everyone who has come with me so far has LOVED it!\n\nItinerary NOT guaranteed so as to maximize experience! Spontaneous private zheng concert in a riverside pavilion? Let's stop and enjoy! Weather is forecast to be rain in the mountains? Let's go to the ancient village instead.\n\nCosts currently unknown but should be under $100/day for ALL in-country necessities: food, lodging, entrance fees, ground transport. Whatever price I end up quoting will NOT include transport to/from China, alcohol, upgrades to lodging\\*, upgrades to in-country transport\\*.\n\nYou can do it cheaper with a big box tour. If strict time schedules, overpriced shopping, industrial restaurant food, and being kept away from locals is good enough for you than that's your best bet. If unique, real China, great food, insider knowledge with eye for western comforts\\*\\*, and turn on a dime\\*\\*\\* [a mao?] escapades are for you than come with me!\n\nOnly seven people! Small and 'nimble'\\*\\*\\*!\n\nHave you already been to China? Already have seen the Forbidden City and Great Wall? No worries! Big box tours do NOT go where I go!\n\nHave you never been to China and NEED to see the big sights? No problem! I can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hidden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded people so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers with shop-hating history buffs, or long distance hikers with casual strollers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO trips, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/deny as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to get a hint of what one might see. No guarantees of ANYTHING! China changes very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the beaten track. I said 'adventure'!\n\n\\*\\*Sometimes western comforts are just not there. Deep in the countryside villages rarely have western toilets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Quick change of plans is relative in China; western expectations are best set aside and an embrace the new/unknown/surprise attitude is highly recommended. But that's what a cultural adventure is all about!\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh & Triangle Activities",

    "description": "Religious studies professor Hugo Méndez (FFP ’22) will give a lecture titled “Writing a New History of the Biblical Books of John,” based on his recent research. Register for the event here. (This was previously scheduled for Jan. 30.)\n\nThe Christian Bible contains four texts attributed to a disciple of Jesus named “John”: the Gospel of John and the letters of 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John. But what do we know about the origins of these texts? Who really wrote them? In this lecture, Méndez argues that these works are a chain of falsely authored works (pseudepigrapha), written by multiple pens over several decades. The author of the Gospel invented a disciple of Jesus to serve as the narrator of his text; the authors of the letters, in turn, co-opted this character, fleshing out so many afterlives for him. This presentation traces this arc, showing how a single act of disguised authorship inspired a new literary tradition and shaped twenty centuries of Christian culture.\n\nHugo Méndez is an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he teaches New Testament and early Christianity. He is the author or co-author of four books, including two written as a Borden Faculty Fellow at the IAH: The Gospel of John: A New History (Oxford, 2025) and The Epistles of John: Origins, Authorship, Purpose (Cambridge, forthcoming). He is also a frequent contributor to documentaries for History and other media outlets.\n\n \n\nLearn more about the event at the IAH website. See all events in the IAH Fellows Forum series.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

In this hands-on webinar series, you'll see tech leaders walk through their AI product in real time, highlighting exactly how it works in the wild: setup, workflows, integrations, all in just 30 minutes.\n\nBuilt on the momentum of our AI Demo Day format, Plug & Play goes deeper. Presenters slow down and dig in: demonstrating usability, showing off speed to value, and guiding attendees through common real-world scenarios. It’s a rare opportunity to see how tools behave under actual conditions, not just polished slides.\n\nExpect 2–3 hours of back-to-back, engaging walkthroughs. Attendees are encouraged to click along live, ask questions, and walk away with more than awareness—usable knowledge.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1️⃣ **Real Product Experience:** See full workflows in motion—not just the highlights.\n\n2️⃣ **Usability in Focus:** Evaluate ease of use, integration paths, and how quickly value is delivered.\n\n3️⃣ **Interactive Learning:** Follow along live and get answers as you go.\n\n4️⃣ **Depth Over Demos:** A deeper understanding of how AI tools actually fit into your stack.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042c9tg0)**\n\nSource: Meetup: Data Science Raleigh",

This session explores what happens in the brain during high-pressure moments and why that makes it harder to lead with clarity. We will look at how pressure pushes leaders toward managing instead of leading, and why that matters for your team’s growth and resilience. Most importantly, you will leave with a simple, practical tool to help you slow down, refocus, and lead in a way that aligns with your values, even when the stakes are high.\n\nWorkshop Objectives:\n\n• Explain how stress impacts the brain and leadership behavior\n• Identify your default leadership lane under pressure\n• Shift from managing the crisis to leading through it\n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

    "description": "Raleigh AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin our virtual Meetup to hear talks from experts on cutting-edge topics across AI, ML, and computer vision.\n\n**Date, Time and Location**\n\nApr 2, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/ai-ml-and-computer-vision-meetup-april-2-2026)**\n\n**Async Agents in Production: Failure Modes and Fixes**\n\nAs models improve, we are starting to build long-running, asynchronous agents such as deep research agents and browser agents that can execute multi-step workflows autonomously. These systems unlock new use cases, but they fail in ways that short-lived agents do not.\n\nThe longer an agent runs, the more early mistakes compound, and the more token usage grows through extended reasoning, retries, and tool calls. Patterns that work for request-response agents often break down, leading to unreliable behaviour and unpredictable costs.\n\nThis talk is aimed at use case developers, with secondary relevance for platform engineers. It covers the most common failure modes in async agents and practical design patterns for reducing error compounding and keeping token costs bounded in production.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Meryem Arik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meryemarik/) is the co-founder and CEO of Doubleword, where she works on large-scale LLM inference and production AI systems. She studied theoretical physics and philosophy at the University of Oxford. Meryem is a frequent conference speaker, including a TEDx speaker and a four-time highly rated speaker at QCon conferences. She was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for her work in AI infrastructure.\n\n**Visual AI at the Edge: Beyond the Model**\n\nEdge-based visual AI promises low latency, privacy, and real-time decision-making, but many projects struggle to move beyond successful demos. This talk explores what deploying visual AI at the edge really involves, shifting the focus from models to complete, operational systems. We will discuss common pitfalls teams encounter when moving from lab to field. Attendees will leave with a practical mental model for approaching edge vision projects more effectively.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[David Moser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-moser-dm/) is an AI/Computer Vision expert and Founding Engineer with a strong track record of building and deploying safety-critical visual AI systems in real-world environments. As Co-Founder of Orella Vision, he is building Visual AI for Autonomy on the Edge - going from data and models to production-grade edge deployments.\n\n**Sanitizing Evaluation Datasets: From Detection to Correction**\n\nWe generally accept that gold standard evaluation sets contain label noise, yet we rarely fix them because the engineering friction is too high. This talk presents a workflow to operationalize ground-truth auditing. We will demonstrate how to bridge the gap between algorithmic error detection and manual rectification. Specifically, we will show how to inspect discordant ground truth labels and correct them directly in-situ. The goal is to move to a fully trusted end-to-end evaluation pipeline.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Nick Lotz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholaslotz) is an engineer on the Voxel51 community team. With a background in open source infrastructure and a passion for developer enablement, Nick focuses on helping teams understand their tools and how to use them to ship faster.\n\n**Building enterprise agentic systems that scale**\n\nBuilding AI agents that work in demos is easy, building true assistants that make people genuinely productive takes a different set of patterns. This talk shares lessons from a multi-agent system at Cisco used by 2,000+ sellers daily, where we moved past \"chat with your data\" to encoding business workflows into true agentic systems people actually rely on to get work done.\n\nWe'll cover multi-agent orchestration patterns for complex workflows, the personalization and productivity features that drive adoption, and the enterprise foundations that helped us earn user trust at scale. You'll leave with an architecture and set of patterns that have been battle tested at enterprise scale.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Aman Sardana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amansardana/) is a Senior Engineering Architect at Cisco, I lead the design and deployment of enterprise AI systems that blend LLMs, data infrastructure, and customer experience to solve high‑stakes, real-world problems at scale. I’m also an open-source contributor and active mentor in the AI community, helping teams move from AI experimentation to reliable agentic applications in production.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision",

By learning the top 30 plant families growing around you, you will begin to recognize plants everywhere you go. After an indoor presentation on the major plant families common to the Southeastern U.S., ethnobotanist marc williams will reinforce your plant identification skills on a walk in the Gardens to observe family patterns in leaf, flower and fruit types. Discuss edibility, medicinality, craft, wildlife support and landscape beauty as you gain a more holistic understanding of the major plants comprising Southern U.S. flora and their potential ecological and ethnobotanical applications. \nFee: $32; 20% discount for Duke Gardens members with discount code. \nParking: Fees apply. \nLocation: Onsite at Duke Gardens.

How much should I water? What’s the best way to plant, fertilize or repot? In this class, Bryce Lane will bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks, you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving, learning how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

    "description": "Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code with the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their nationwide zoning atlas. \"The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key aspects of zoning codes in an online, user-friendly map.\" The Atlas aims to provide data for better solutions in transportation, environmental, and especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents have long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile, install the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforthecarolinas.org) or reach out to info@codewiththecarolinas.org\n\nAll activities of Code with the Carolinas, a project of [Social Good Fund](https://www.socialgoodfund.org/), follow our [Code of Conduct](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/0d32d5f905f8fd49d5e80395f8fd47f2b59ce3ef8b335f72/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTkx) and are subject to this [Volunteer Waiver of Liability](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/06dd62200e6b28426b137e0e6b2848fb901487014f72cd16/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTE2).\n\nSource: Meetup: Code with the Carolinas",

This course will introduce participants to some of the best practices of professional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Python code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scripts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for their functions, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities and ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the original analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control system. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Github, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests are run each time code is changed.\n\nThe course will primarily consist of a hands-on exercise to restructure a single long analysis file into functions and automated tests.\n\n“Version Control with Git and Github” course is a prerequisite for this course.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

Attendees leave with a framework for data centric AI for research and production pipelines, prioritizing data quality over pure model iteration.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\n* **Structure unstructured data.** Map data and metadata into a queryable schema for images, videos, and point clouds.\n* **Query datasets with the FiftyOne SDK**. Create complex views based on model predictions, labels, and custom tags. Use the FiftyOne to filter data based on logical conditions and confidence scores.\n* **Visualize high dimensional embeddings**. Project features into lower dimensions to find clusters of similar samples. Identify data gaps and outliers using FiftyOne Brain.\n* **Automate data curation.** Implement algorithmic measures to select diverse subsets for training. Reduce labeling costs by prioritizing high entropy samples.\n* **Debug model performance.** Run evaluation routines to generate confusion matrices and precision recall curves. Visualize false positives and false negatives directly in the App to understand model failures.\n* **Customize FiftyOne**. Build custom dashboards and interactive panels. Create specialized views for domain specific tasks.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Working knowledge of Python and machine learning and/or computer vision fundamentals.\n* All attendees will get access to the tutorials and code examples used in the workshop.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision",

These systems combine computer vision, natural language understanding, and spatial reasoning to enable machines to navigate complex interfaces—from web applications to desktop software—just as humans do. However, building robust GUI agents requires careful attention to dataset curation, model evaluation, and iterative improvement workflows.\n\nParticipants will learn how to leverage [FiftyOne](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone), an open-source toolkit for dataset curation and computer vision workflows, to build production-ready GUI agent systems.\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\n\n* **Dataset Creation & Management:** How to structure, annotate, and load GUI interaction datasets using the COCO4GUI standardized format\n* **Data Exploration & Analysis:** Using FiftyOne's interactive interface to visualize datasets, analyze action distributions, and understand annotation patterns\n* **Multimodal Embeddings:** Computing embeddings for screenshots and UI element patches to enable similarity search and retrieval\n* **Model Inference:** Running state-of-the-art models like Microsoft's GUI-Actor to predict interaction points from natural language instructions\n* **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy using standard metrics and normalized click distance to assess localization precision\n* **Failure Analysis:** Investigating model failures through attention maps, error pattern analysis, and systematic debugging workflows\n* **Data-Driven Improvement:** Tagging samples based on error types (attention misalignment vs. localization errors) to prioritize fine-tuning efforts\n* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Using FiftyOne plugins to augment training data with synthetic task descriptions and variations\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Harpreet Sahota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harpreetsahota204/) is a hacker-in-residence and machine learning engineer with a passion for deep learning and generative AI.

    "description": "Research is relying on increasingly complex code. However, most academics have not received formal training in software development. This course will introduce participants to some of the best practices of professional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Python code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scripts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for their functions, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities and ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the original analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control system. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Github, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests are run each time code is changed.\n\nThe course will primarily consist of a hands-on exercise to restructure a single long analysis file into functions and automated tests.\n\n“Version Control with Git and Github” course is a prerequisite for this course.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

How much should I water? What’s the best way to plant, fertilize or repot? In this class, Bryce Lane will bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks, you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving, learning how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

Outlaw’s story was one of Black success — he was a Union League leader, business owner and the first Black town constable and commissioner in Graham, a small town in North Carolina’s Alamance County. But in 1870, the Ku Klux Klan murdered Outlaw, setting off a dramatic series of events. Allen and Boggs both sought to discover why Outlaw had been erased from mainstream history books. In The Legend of Wyatt Outlaw, they share what they found in artful detail and connect Outlaw’s story to the violence against Black people in Alamance and throughout the United States, from Reconstruction through Jim Crow, the civil rights era and Black Lives Matter.\n\nSource: NC State University",

In this class, Bryce Lane will bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks, you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving, learning how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting.

It is a rare but fine example of a late 18th-century yeoman farmer's dwelling, and it remains in nearly original condition, despite the fact that the descendants of Davenport lived in the house until the mid-1970s without making any modern improvements. A truly unique gem in the region.\n\nThe Sons of the American Revolution are holding a recognition and wreath-laying ceremony, including information about Daniel Davenport's six-month service in the NC 5th Regiment and his legacy in Washington County, at 2:00 pm. Local school children will sing as part of the ceremony.\n\nPlease note: The celebration festival is free, but the food truck on site is not. In addition, the Homestead does not have a specific address. It is located on Mount Tabor Road in Creswell on the corner of State Route 1143 and 1146. If coming from the direction of Creswell, it is on the road to the right after a sharp curve at the Mount Tabor Free Will Baptist Church. You can also use Google Maps, Davenport Homestead, Creswell, NC. It will take you there. Please email Chris Barber with any questions.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

How much should I water? What’s the best way to plant, fertilize or repot? In this class, Bryce Lane will bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks, you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving, learning how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

    "description": "The problem with most attempts to adopt stress-management or self-care routines is that they require time, effort and planning. The reality for many people who have stressful jobs is that they are too physically exhausted and mentally depleted by the end of the day to initiate activities commonly recommended to reduce stress in their lives. The trick is to intervene via multiple “micro-moments” of relaxation or mindful practices which only take 15 to 60 seconds. These moments of relaxation help bring stress levels down during the workday and interrupt the steady escalation of stress that creates physical and mental exhaustion. Also addressed: simple winding-down routines that can end the day in a calming, mindful way.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nThis training will help you:\n• Describe how stress escalates through the day and leads to exhaustion\n• Consider whether your present stress reduction habits may be adding to your overall stress\n• Understand how simple short moments of relaxation throughout the day can permit you reduce stress and\nconserve energy\n• Practice brief mindful moments of relaxation and learn how to integrate these moments into your workday\n• Understand the value of winding-down routines that foster a sense of safety and personal control.\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

    "description": "Take a glance through recent news or social media and you would be hard-pressed not to see mentions of chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI) methods aimed at generating text, images and other content.  Recent work by Eloundou and colleagues (2023) explored the potential impact of these types of generative AI on labor markets, and survey research, specifically was among the top two most impacted industries.  Professor Andrew Ng has been cited as saying “AI won’t replace human workers, but ‘people that use it will replace people that don’t.’”  Much of the way researchers in the social sciences and survey research are incorporating AI into their workflow involves some type of prompting.  Prompt Engineering approaches along with more nuanced fine tuning approaches are being used and refined to better incorporate more robust approaches for AI incorporation into the research process.  In this shortcourse we will provide an overview of the emerging field of prompt engineering and illustrate how a prompt engineering approach and problem specification mindset can be useful for maximizing the utility of large language models, specifically, within social science.  Concepts and experimental approaches will be illustrated using several real-world, grounded and published work.  The shortcourse also incorporates an experiential component that encourages participants to apply basic concepts that we cover in the course in real-time as we work on exercises together in the later part of the course. Registration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

In this class, Bryce Lane will bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks, you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving, learning how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the science behind good technique — understanding how soil, water, nutrients and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspect of plant care, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier, more resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University",

To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile, install the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforthecarolinas.org) or reach out to info@codewiththecarolinas.org\n\nAll activities of Code with the Carolinas, a project of [Social Good Fund](https://www.socialgoodfund.org/), follow our [Code of Conduct](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/0d32d5f905f8fd49d5e80395f8fd47f2b59ce3ef8b335f72/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTkx) and are subject to this [Volunteer Waiver of Liability](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/06dd62200e6b28426b137e0e6b2848fb901487014f72cd16/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTE2).\n\nSource: Meetup: Code with the Carolinas",

    "description": "Managing individuals who may be struggling with stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health concerns can be a difficult balancing act. Your role is to manage performance and to bring out the best in your workforce, but accomplishing this often requires you to express concern and support when employees struggle emotionally. Managers often feel uncomfortable in this aspect of their role and may lack the important skills of “emotional management.” This course covers ways employees may present their distress and offers insights and strategies on forging supportive empathic alliances within the role of manager. The session also identifies common mistakes managers make in responding to employees in distress and explains communication skills that express support and convey positive expectancy. Participants are also given information on how to refer employees to the Employee Assistance Program.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nBy the end of this workshop, you will:\n• Understand the universality of mental health issues in the workplace\n• Recognize the most common symptoms of mental illness\n• Identify the most common unhelpful reactions to symptoms, why they occur and how to avoid them\n• Identify ways of expressing compassion and developing an alliance with distressed employees\n• Reduce the stigma associated mental illness and promote ways of supporting one another in the workplace\n• Recognize the warning signs of suicide\n• Identify support services and resources for all leaders and employees\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

Brendan “Cletus” Burks, commanding officer of MCAS Cherry Point. “In partnership with 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and our community, we are proud to host a world-class event that reflects the professionalism of our Marines and the enduring bond we share with Eastern North Carolina.”\n\nHeadlining the 2026 event is the return of the legendary U.S. Navy Blue Angels, joined by an exciting lineup of military and civilian acts that continue to inspire and captivate. Fan-favorite performances such as the jet truck, parachute jump team, and aerobatic pilots like Randy Ball, RJ Gritter and Tom Larkin are already slated to return.\n\nAs always, the air show will be free and open to the public, with general admission and parking offered at no cost. Premium seating options will also be available for those seeking upgraded amenities. Visitors can expect an immersive experience filled with aerial demonstrations, aircraft static displays, food vendors, and interactive exhibits for guests of all ages.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

Brendan “Cletus” Burks, commanding officer of MCAS Cherry Point. “In partnership with 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and our community, we are proud to host a world-class event that reflects the professionalism of our Marines and the enduring bond we share with Eastern North Carolina.”\n\nHeadlining the 2026 event is the return of the legendary U.S. Navy Blue Angels, joined by an exciting lineup of military and civilian acts that continue to inspire and captivate. Fan-favorite performances such as the jet truck, parachute jump team, and aerobatic pilots like Randy Ball, RJ Gritter and Tom Larkin are already slated to return.\n\nAs always, the air show will be free and open to the public, with general admission and parking offered at no cost. Premium seating options will also be available for those seeking upgraded amenities. Visitors can expect an immersive experience filled with aerial demonstrations, aircraft static displays, food vendors, and interactive exhibits for guests of all ages.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

We’ll examine how leading teams are designing for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), grounding, memory, and orchestration to ensure outputs reflect the right data, tone, and constraints at the right time.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Architecting the Context Layer:** What the emerging stack looks like—from vector databases and memory systems to orchestration layers and policy enforcement.\n\n2️⃣ **Reducing Hallucinations:** How context-aware design helps constrain generative outputs to known, verifiable sources.\n\n3️⃣ **Boosting Trust & Alignment:** Techniques for integrating domain-specific knowledge, tone, and compliance rules directly into AI interactions.\n\n4️⃣ **From Static to Dynamic Context:** When to use retrieval, when to use memory, and how to balance both for adaptive, scalable systems.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042cLJx0)**\n\nSource: Meetup: Data Science Raleigh",

To improve zoning policies, we first need to better understand the current state of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile, install the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforthecarolinas.org) or reach out to info@codewiththecarolinas.org\n\nAll activities of Code with the Carolinas, a project of [Social Good Fund](https://www.socialgoodfund.org/), follow our [Code of Conduct](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/0d32d5f905f8fd49d5e80395f8fd47f2b59ce3ef8b335f72/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTkx) and are subject to this [Volunteer Waiver of Liability](https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/06dd62200e6b28426b137e0e6b2848fb901487014f72cd16/1/8/Nzg/NzgvMTE2).\n\nSource: Meetup: Code with the Carolinas",

    "description": "Does your landscape look tired near the end of summer? Give yourself and the wildlife around you a boost with fall-forward perennials. At their peak during late summer and fall, these species have unique charms and an important ecological role. They give pollinators the resources they need before transitioning to the next stage of development. The superstars of autumn, asters and goldenrods, are keystone species that lend outsized support to food webs. They and other fall-forward plants extend the season visually and offer a rich tapestry of color and radiance optimized for the changing angle of the sun. Join Shannon Currey, education and outreach at Izel Native Plants, to learn more about lighting up your landscape with fall in mind! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

    "description": "For a long time, the scientific community believed we were born with a certain number of brain cells and neural pathways and that, once damaged, they could not be repaired. In reality, our brains are much more flexible. Depending on our lifestyle, we can weaken or destroy connections, or create new, stronger ones. Engaging regularly in certain behaviors and activities, like physical exercise, addressing mental health issues, meditation, and learning a new language or musical instrument, support new wiring and can make existing pathways stronger. Essentially, we can slow down or somewhat prevent cognitive decline by doing challenging mental exercises to keep our brains fit for optimal power.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\nIdentify traits of a healthy brain:\n• The ability to learn new skills\n• Judgment and intuition\n• Memory and perception\nIdentify barriers to good brain health:\n• Depression\n• Chronic stress\n• Unhealthy lifestyle\nIdentify methods for optimal cognitive health:\n• Engaging in new skills and mentally challenging activities\n• Meditation\n• Physical exercise\n• Brain training\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

    "description": "Your body responds to the way you think, feel and act. This is often called the “mind/body connection.” When you are stressed, anxious or upset, your body tries to tell you that something isn’t right. For example, high blood pressure might develop after a particularly stressful event, such as the death of a loved one. People with good emotional health are aware of their thoughts, feelings and behaviors. They have learned healthy ways to cope with the stress and problems that are a normal part of life. They feel good about themselves and have healthy relationships. Poor emotional health can weaken your body’s immune system, making you more likely to get colds and other infections during emotionally difficult times. Also, when you are feeling stressed, anxious or upset, you may not take care of your health as well as you should. You may not feel like exercising, eating nutritious foods or taking medicine that your doctor prescribes. Abuse of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs may also be a sign of poor emotional health.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\nIdentify the relationship between mind and body\n• Describe how the body influences emotional and mental functioning\n• Describe how our emotions, beliefs and self talk impact our body\n• Identify symptoms of a possible mind/body disconnection\nIdentify ways to enhance the mind/body connection\n• Describe methods for achieving balance in life\n• Identify ways to express feelings appropriately\n• Describe the importance of taking care of your health\n• Describe ways to enhance awareness\nIdentify your personal action plan for mind/body connection\n• Recognize the importance of consulting with your physician\n• Describe which mind/body tools need to develop\n• List outside resources for further help\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill",

Most birders start out by identifying common birds found at their backyard bird feeders. During this workshop you will learn how to point out key characteristics, such as size, coloration, and activity, that can help you identify common backyard bird species, specifically species that visit bird feeders. By using applications like Audubon and Merlin, along with identification guides, you will be able to use those key characteristics to help you identify common species found here in the High Country. Binoculars are not required, but highly recommended, and there will be a quick lesson on how to properly use binoculars. This is a Ranger Workshop with The Town of Seven Devils.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

The New Bern Resolves constitute a significant chapter in the history of the American Revolution, reflecting the growing discontent of the colonies with British rule and their bold steps toward self-governance. Adopted on August 27, 1774, by 71 elected NC delegates to the First Provincial Congress in America, the New Bern Resolves represented an early, decisive expression of resistance to British policies and \"The Intolerable Acts\" (Boston Port/Trade Act, Massachusetts Government Act, Administration of Justice Act, and Quartering Acts) by calling for economic sanctions against Great Britain and its trading partners. As one of the earliest documented calls for solidarity among the colonies, the New Bern Resolves laid the groundwork for broader revolutionary movements.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

    "description": "Harriet Ann Daves recalled just how monumental Civil War surrenders were for her family: \"When the surrender came my grandfather came to my mother and told her: 'Well, you are as free as I am.'\"\n\nClaiming freedom was not so straightforward for the 331,059 enslaved women, children, and men during the Civil War. Some took enormous risk to reach Union lines before the federal government made any promise of abolishing slavery. Others left their homes and plantations to follow Sherman's army as they marched through the southeast. Some believed home was where they already lived and worked and waited patiently for freedom to extend to them. Others still were lied to by their enslavers or moved away from the advancing U.S. Army so they would remain enslaved. Freedom came in different ways and at different times to enslaved people across the state.\n\nOne common thread unites these freedom stories: the defeat of the Confederate military ensured a new birth of freedom across the state and nation.\n\nDuring this special luminary program, Bennett Place invites you to reflect on the end of the Civil War as a momentous step towards freedom for all Americans and the end of chattel slavery in the United States. Walk among 3,310 luminaries - one for every 1,000 enslaved people in North Carolina - and reflect on experiences of enslavement and freedom. Historians dot the path and share stories of people's pathways to freedom and life after slavery & the Civil War.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources",

    "description": "Triangle AI Meetup\nThis talk is an in-depth look at XMPP, the open standard for real-time messaging, and how to build a global scale, AI enhanced messaging system using XMPP. We’ll explore EJabberD, the massively scalable, open-source XMPP server that powers in-game chat for Eve Online, and examine how to: combine XMPP with WebRTC for real-time audio/video calling, add AIML to build helpful chatbots, and how to incorporate Deep Learning to categorize messages in real-time. After the talk, you’ll know how to use XMPP and Ejabberd to build anything from a help-desk chatops application, to a globe spanning in-game messaging system.\n\nSource: Meetup: Triangle AI",
