SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Removal (Marvin)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Habitat Builders Chapter at Marvin Efird Park to remove some invasive species. We will show you how to identify various species and how to remove them from the landscape. \n\nInvasive plants are non-native introduced plants that do not support native wildlife. They are very aggressive\, outcompete wildlife-friendly plants\, and take over natural areas. Nandina\, Privet\, Monkey Grass\, and Autumn/Russian olive are common invasive plants that have escaped residential landscapes and are taking over natural areas. To make matters worse\, these plants are still available for sale in big box stores. \n\nWe will have some tools available\, but you are encouraged to bring a pair of loppers\, pruners\, pruning saw\, or shovel. NO POWER TOOLS PLEASE. \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

SUMMARY:Craft Club & Supply Swap
DESCRIPTION:Get artsy crafty over a craft beer at our new Craft Club! Bring your own craft to do alongside others – whether it’s knitting\, sewing\, coloring\, painting\, whatever! Show off what you’re working on and learn from the skills of others as you sip cocktails\, brews\, wine\, THC beverages\, and more! \nAnd bonus – every week we’re also hosting a craft swap! Are you a serial hobbyist? Do you have a silly excess of scraps and leftover supplies from discarded crafty projects? How about that pile of things you actually did finish\, but that you can’t possibly use all of? Bring the excess items you’ve made and your spare supplies to trade! Participants will be able to drop their contributions on a reserved table\, and everyone can shop the stash. We will operate on an honor system where everyone is encouraged to take roughly the same value of things they brought. \nEven better\, once a month our Craft Club will also host a workshop on various topics so you can learn and grow as an artist while you have fun. \nSo grab a drink\, get crafty\, and plan to hang out for a while to see who all stops by and what type of goods come through the swap. \n\n\nSource: Downtown Durham Inc

SUMMARY:The Song of the Earth
DESCRIPTION:Enter a realm where beauty and mortality intertwine in The Song of the Earth\, a hauntingly intimate performance of Arnold Schoenberg and Rainer Riehn’s arrangement of Gustav Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde. Scored for a reduced ensemble yet retaining every ounce of Mahler’s emotional depth\, this rarely heard transcription brings clarity and immediacy to a masterpiece that meditates on life\, loss\, and the eternal. With its fusion of symphony and song\, East and West\, hope and despair\, The Song of the Earth offers a deeply human experience that is at once fragile\, powerful\, and timeless.\n\nSource: Downtown Durham Inc

DESCRIPTION:The Johri lab is interested in better characterizing the shape
  of the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in organisms and
  on understanding how selection on functionally important regions affects
  genome-wide patterns of variation. Population genomic inference currentl
 y does not account for the effects of selection across the genome\, which
  is especially problematic in species with compact genomes (i.e.\, those 
 with a high density of protein-coding and regulatory regions) where natur
 al selection is pervasive. We develop statistical and computational metho
 ds that simultaneously account for the effects of selection jointly with 
 other evolutionary processes to make accurate evolutionary inferences (su
 ch as historical changes in population size) using sequence variation fro
 m natural populations. As most pathogenic species tend to have highly com
 pact genomes and experience strong bouts of selection and drastic repeate
 d bottlenecks\, our methodological advances and recent theoretical effort
 s will be important to uncovering their population and selective history.\n\nSource: Duke University

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night!
DESCRIPTION:Durham Geeks\nWe meet at Moon Dog Meadery under Joe Van Gogh o
 n Broad Street every Monday night. We have loads of games (some belong to 
 MoonDog\, some are brought by attendees)\, a fun and welcoming group of fo
 lks (always eager to have more\, however!)\, and there are always folks ea
 ger to teach games to those who haven't played certain titles.\n\nMoondog 
 has a growing collection of canned and bottled brews\, ciders\, and colas 
 in addition to their in-house-brewed meads. There are also some snacks lik
 e chips and popcorn. Sometimes\, folks bring in other treats to share. If 
 you do\, please mark them as containing any common allergens.\n\nOutside f
 ood (delivered\, brought in\, or homemade) is welcomed and encouraged. Out
 side drinks are not. Since the venue does not prepare food\, **dogs are al
 lowed and welcomed.** (Dogs are very friendly and welcoming\, too\, but th
 ey mostly roam around to collect ear scritches and love. If you're not com
 fortable with dogs around\, let us know\, and we'll try to accommodate.)\n
 \nBring games\, friends\, and a welcoming spirit. We're excited to have yo
 u with us!\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Geeks

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Meditation + Yoga Flow with Recess Yoga
DESCRIPTION:If you’ve been running on auto-pilot lately\, this class is your pause. Join Diamond (she/her) for a 45-minute midday retreat of mind-body connection\, gentle yogic movement\, and a practice of meditation. This practice is located at Recess Yoga Durham. Please note the studio is accessible by stairs on the second floor. \nConnect with Diamond on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/carolinad1m3/ \nOver the past decade\, Diamond (she/her) has explored several paths of yoga\, leading to her completion of a 200-hour in-person Hatha/Raja Yoga & Meditation teacher training in Durham\, NC in 2024. Her training follows the lineages of Sri Dharma Mittra and Thich Nhat Hanh\, with a focus on mindfulness\, meditation\, and inclusivity.\nHer teaching style is gentle and empowering\, encouraging students to listen to their bodies\, honor their needs\, and explore the practice at their own pace. She believes yoga is a powerful tool for managing everyday stress and deepening self-awareness\, both on and off the mat. Off the mat\, Diamond works in hospitality as a restaurant manager in downtown Durham and enjoys exploring local food\, nature\, and live music. Whether you’re brand new or returning to the mat\, Diamond invites you to join her in a practice rooted in presence\, curiosity\, and self-discovery.\n\nSource: Downtown Durham Inc

DESCRIPTION:The mechanical properties of biological tissues change over ti
 me and with disease progression. Quantifying these mechanical properties 
 can thus be instrumental for medical diagnosis and for evaluation of tiss
 ue viability for transplant. However\, it is exceptionally challenging to
  mechanically characterize soft and biological materials using convention
 al testing methods\, especially in-vivo. In recent years\, volume control
 led cavity expansion (VCCE) has emerged as a powerful needle-based method
  for quantifying the nonlinear properties of soft materials in-situ. In t
 his talk\, after briefly revisiting the fundamentals of VCCE\, I will des
 cribe the translation of VCCE into Digital Palpation (DP)\; a minimally i
 nvasive diagnostic tool offering a quantitative alternative to a clinicia
 n's sense of touch. I will describe the application of DP for testing in 
 human tissue and will focus on an ex-vivo study of 35 tests in freshly re
 sected human thyroid nodules. I will show how data from this rapid and mi
 nimally invasive mechanical test enables separation between benign and ma
 lignant nodules of this highly prevalent cancer and can even hint at reso
 lving oncocytic and follicular sub-types that routinely confound existing
  diagnosis methods. At present\, up to one third of thyroid nodules canno
 t be decisively classified\, leading to avoidable surgical removal of the
  thyroid gland. We hope that these results can\, in the future\, help to 
 reduce the large fraction of thyroidectomies (40-70%) that ultimately pro
 ve benign and thus avoidable\; potentially relieving patients from the po
 tential life-long implications of surgical complications and hormone repl
 acement\, and paving the way for the diagnosis of additional diseases.\n\nSource: Duke University

 our registration.</i>\n\nThe Duke Office of Scientific Integrity is partn
 ering with Trinity College to expand our offerings of interactive Respons
 ible Conduct of Research (RCR) trainings tailored for Duke researchers in
  the humanities\, arts\, and interpretative social sciences!\n\nWe've hea
 rd the feedback that the RCR training programs - which are required for a
 ll research-active Duke faculty and staff - have not been well-matched to
  research in the humanities. So\, we're working with Trinity leadership t
 o help make those programs more useful for our faculty\, and we want to e
 ngage the humanities research community in that process. As a first pilot
  step\, we will host RCR training events that will both <b>fulfill the 20
 0-level RCR requirement for attendees</b> and <b>help shape the future of
  RCR training in the humanities and related disciplines</b>. The initial 
 events will be limited to senior (e.g.\, associate\, full\, emeritus) fac
 ulty who work in any area of the humanities\, arts\, and/or interpretive 
 social sciences. We believe that your perspective can help us shape the d
 evelopment of more relevant and effective research training programs.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:QCD and effective field theory together put low energy nuclear
  physics on solid theoretical footing to calculate observables with some 
 confidence\, but open questions remain.  Two related questions are why QC
 D seems not to violate CP and how the properties of nuclear matter depend
  on the light quark masses (or equivalently the pion mass).  The classic 
 solution to the former problem is to invoke a new light field\, the QCD a
 xion\, a well-motivated dark matter candidate which a diverse experimenta
 l campaign is currently searching for.  Neutron stars can also probe the 
 QCD axion parameter space if nuclear matter becomes more attractive at re
 duced pion mass via the formation of an axion condensate.  Answering the 
 question of whether an axion with a mass at the QCD prediction could cond
 ense in neutron stars hinges on a number of fundamental questions in nucl
 ear physics\, including the properties of three nucleon forces\, the impo
 rtance of light resonances neglected in chiral EFT\, fine tuning in s-wav
 e scattering\, and at what density chiral symmetry restoration occurs in 
 cold nuclear matter.  In this talk\, I will present our current research 
 on pion mass dependence in chiral EFT\, possible observable signatures in
  neutron stars\, and what the study of pion mass dependence can teach us 
 about extant theoretical problems in low energy nuclear physics.\n\nSource: Duke University

DESCRIPTION:Collecting data is now easier than it has ever been. But\, as d
 ata becomes more prolific\, datasets become larger and more complex. How do
  we find meaningful patterns in our data? How can we communicate those patt
 erns to others? Data visualization allows us to make sense of today’s ever 
 evolving information landscape.\n\n \n\nThis workshop will introduce the hi
 story and basic principles of data visualization. Learn about best practice
 s and resources for making an impact with your data through compelling char
 ts\, graphs\, and maps. At the end of the short course\, participants will 
 be able to:\n\nUnderstand the preattentive process and how it affects visua
 l perceptionCritically evaluate the accuracy and quality of visualizations 
 they encounter in their daily livesImplement best practices when creating t
 heir own visualizations \n\nThis workshop is offered by University Librarie
 s and will be led by librarian Lorin Bruckner.\n\n \n\nThis workshop is bei
 ng offered remotely via Zoom only. Registrants will receive a Zoom link\; t
 hose on the waitlist will not receive a Zoom link unless they are bumped up

DESCRIPTION:Across the country\, colleges and universities are grappling wi
 th a difficult reality: Students are arriving on campus with fewer coping s
 kills\, less resilience and greater struggles with emotional regulation. Ma
 ny have not yet learned how to manage disappointment or move through tempor
 ary setbacks. This leaves staff and faculty on the front lines\, shoulderin
 g the emotional weight — often without the tools they need to protect their
  own well-being.\n\nJoin the Office of Equal Opportunity on Tuesday\, Feb. 
 17\, to learn how Pepperdine University's innovative Resilience-Informed Sk
 ills Education (RISE) program was developed and implemented. You'll hear fr
 om expert presenters about RISE\, a proactive\, research-informed\, skill-b

SUMMARY:Lunch And Learn - AI Assistants\, Agents\, Orchestration
DESCRIPTION:Research Triangle DevOps\nThis session kicks off a three-part 
 lunch-and-learn webinar series on DevOps\, AI\, and agents\, focused on pr
 actical use and guardrails.\n\nEveryone’s talking about AI “agents”\
 , but most people mean very different things. In this first session\, we s
 low the hype down to unpack what assistants\, agents\, and orchestration a
 ctually are\, why DevOps teams are suddenly prime territory for experiment
 ation\, and where things go sideways when speed outruns review\, security\
 , and operational reality.\n\nWe will explore agentic AI as a common vocab
 ulary\, a few durable mental models\, and a grounded look at where real le
 verage exists today\, especially if you already live in CI/CD and automati
 on. You will leave with a clearer way to distinguish assistants\, agents\,
  and orchestration\, and an understanding of where AI fits into organizati
 ons.\n\nSource: Meetup: Triangle DevOps

SUMMARY:Feb 18 - Feedback-Driven Annotation Pipelines for End-to-End ML Wo
 rkflows
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nIn t
 his technical workshop\, we’ll show how to build a feedback-driven annot
 ation pipeline for perception models using **[FiftyOne](https://docs.voxel
 51.com/index.html)**. We’ll explore real model failures and data gaps\, 
 and turn them into focused annotation tasks that then route through a repe
 atable workflow for labeling and QA. The result is an end-to-end pipeline 
 keeping annotators\, tools\, and models aligned and closing the loop from 
 annotation\, curation\, back to model training and evaluation.\n\n**Time a
 nd Location**\n\nFeb 18\, 2026\n10 - 11 AM PST\nOnline. **[Register for th
 e Zoom!](https://link.voxel51.com/26-0218-annotation-meetup)**\n\n**What y
 ou'll learn**\n\n* **Techniques for labeling the data that matters the mos
 t** for annotation time and cost savings\n* **Structure human-in-the-loop 
 workflows** for finding and fixing model errors\, data gaps\, and targeted
  relabeling instead of bulk labeling\n* **Combine auto-labeling and human 
 review** in a single\, feedback-driven pipeline for perception models\n* *
 *Use label schemas and metadata as “data contracts”** to enforce consi
 stency between annotators\, models\, and tools\, especially for multimodal
  data\n* **Detect and manage schema drift** and tie schema versions to dat
 aset and model versions for reproducibility\n* **QA and review steps** tha
 t surface label issues early and tie changes back to model behavior\n* **A
 n annotation architecture** that can accommodate new perception tasks and 
 feedback signals without rebuilding your entire data stack\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

SUMMARY:Four Signs Your Data Is (Actually) Ready for AI
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nMany enterprises believe they’re ready
  for AI once models are selected\, platforms are deployed\, and pilots are
  underway. But in practice\, AI initiatives often stall before reaching pr
 oduction—or they underperform once they do. The root cause? The data isn
 ’t actually ready.\n\nIn this thought-leadership session\, Naveen Punjab
 i from Google Cloud and Jake Bengtson from Striim unpack four critical sig
 ns that your data foundation can actually support AI at scale. Drawing fro
 m real-world customer patterns\, we’ll explore why centralized data isn
 ’t enough\, how invisible data errors derail AI outcomes\, and why stale
  data threatens use cases like RAG and AI agents.\n\nWhat we'll cover:\n\n
 * What Google Cloud is seeing across enterprise AI adoption—and where da
 ta readiness tends to break down\n* Four practical indicators your data is
  ready for trustworthy\, production-grade AI\n* Why validation and accurac
 y matter before any models get involved\n* How real-time pipelines give AI
  access to operational truth\n* How Google Cloud and Striim help enterpris
 es move from AI experimentation to enterprise impact\n\nThis session is bu
 ilt for data\, analytics\, and AI leaders ready to move beyond AI experime
 ntation—and build foundations that truly support scale.\n\n**What You'll
  Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Spot the Warning Signs:** Know when your data might
  silently sabotage your AI initiatives.\n\n2️⃣ **Go Beyond Centralizat
 ion:** Why a data lake isn’t the same as a data strategy.\n\n3️⃣ **E
 nable Live AI:** How real-time pipelines can unlock true operational intel
 ligence.\n\n4️⃣ **Validate Early\, Scale Confidently:** Why data quali
 ty must be addressed before model deployment.\n\n5️⃣**Learn from the F
 ield:** What Google Cloud and Striim have seen across real enterprise AI j
 ourneys.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q0417jxY0)**\n\nSource: Meetup: Data Science Raleigh

DESCRIPTION:This interactive\, hands-on workshop will introduce participant
 s to a research design framework for considering the use of generative AI i
 n qualitative research designs and workflows (Paulus & Lester\, 2024).\nWe 
 will start by acknowledging inherent risks and ethical dilemmas posed by th
 e development of large language models and how generative AI is challenging
  the essence of what it means to do qualitative work (Paulus & Marone\, 202
 5\; Paulus\, Lester & Davis\, 2025). We will learn how to distinguish betwe
 en methodological strategies and technological tactics\, i.e. why researche
 rs must first know how they want to work with their data before choosing th
 e best tools to do so. We will then discuss the current ‘state of play’ reg
 arding the various genres of AI-assist technologies available to qualitativ
 e researchers and how to select the most appropriate platform. We will then
  design and implement an “AI-assisted workflow” for managing and analyzing 
 data using MAXQDA. Finally\, we will discuss best practices for how to repo
 rt the use of AI in research studies (Lester & Paulus\, forthcoming) and ho
 w to reflexively consider the consequences of doing so.\nSample interview d
 ata will be used for the practice exercises with discussion around the use 
 of other types of qualitative data. Workshop time will alternate between sh
 ort lectures and demonstrations\, small group discussions\, practical hands
 -on activities\, and application of principles learned to the participants’
  own research studies and data.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stu
 dents) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Science Café: Rhinos\, Red Pandas\, and Hell Pigs\, Oh My!
DESCRIPTION:a glimpse into North Carolina’s terrestrial ecosystems 20 million years ago\nMuseum paleontologist Sean Moran holds the cast of a single hell pig molar. \nJoin us in person or watch the livestream on YouTube. \nMuch of North Carolina’s fossil record over the last 100 million years is derived from marine environments\, often excluding fossils from terrestrial ecosystems. This talk will explore new fossils collected from Jones County and deposited in the early Miocene\, about 20 million years ago\, that are beginning to shed light on an unusual land mammal fauna from our state. \nSean Moran is the Collections Manager of Paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Though responsible for managing and growing the Museum’s Paleontology Research Collections\, from fossil crabs to dinosaurs\, ferns to sharks\, his research interests mostly relate to the evolution and ecology of terrestrial mammals over the last 34 million years. \nGrab a bite from the Daily Planet Café and join host Chris Smith for our monthly Science Café. Gather with other curious minds at this after-hours event for an informal presentation and conversation about current science topics with guest experts. The Daily Planet Café is open 5–8pm with a full menu during the Science Café.\n\nSource: NC Museum of Natural Sciences

 ive performance and digital video sleight-of-hand\, a single actor builds a
  cinematic sci-fi comedy in real time\, transforming an 8x4 white box into 
 a cosmic wonderland.\n\nThe acclaimed physical theater company Sinking Ship
  Productions and the Obie Award-winning Theater in Quarantine have reimagin
 ed their streaming hit\, The 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy\, as a mind-bending i
 n-person experience — a slapstick adventure and poignant meditation on the 
 tug-of-war between the versions of ourselves we can never escape.\n\nThe 7t

 ppropriate for audiences of all ages.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:The 2026 Buchdahl Lecture will focus on over 300\,000 years of 
 human history\, using the stories of our ancestors and Indigenous cultures 
 to show how we have survived climate change\, war\, diseases and countless 
 other challenges. We will explore the story of Egypt's so-called Old Kingdo
 m collapse in 2200 BCE\, learning how that time period is a mirror for life
  today and how societies respond to concurrent crises.  The archaeological 
 site of el Lisht\, Egypt's capital from the Middle Kingdom (1800 BCE)\, wil
 l provide a case study for what might be possible following a period of mul
 tiple crises. What we will learn is that the imminent societal collapse pro
 moted by countless tech bros and podcasters is simply a lie. Our ancestors 
 nearly became extinct almost a million years ago\, and yet\, they persisted
 \, evolving into homo sapiens. Our human story is one of survival and hope.
  A better world is possible\, with the road well-lit via evidence from the 
 archaeological evidence and Indigenous wisdom.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Trapped in a time loop\, space traveler Egon Tichy faces his ow
 n worst enemy: himself. And he’s multiplying. In this inventive fusion of l
 ive performance and digital video sleight-of-hand\, a single actor builds a
  cinematic sci-fi comedy in real time\, transforming an 8x4 white box into 
 a cosmic wonderland.\n\nThe acclaimed physical theater company Sinking Ship
  Productions and the Obie Award-winning Theater in Quarantine have reimagin
 ed their streaming hit\, The 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy\, as a mind-bending i
 n-person experience — a slapstick adventure and poignant meditation on the 
 tug-of-war between the versions of ourselves we can never escape.\n\nThe 7t
 h Voyage of Egon Tichy contains mild adult language and situations but is a
 ppropriate for audiences of all ages.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Join us for Rivers and Resistance: Freedom Seeking in Eastern N
 C\, a transformative\, place-based workshop designed for middle and high sc
 hool teachers.\n\n·       Virtual Event Kick Off (via Zoom) on Thursday\, M
 arch 26 (5 PM - 7:30 PM)\n·       Immersive Learning in Eastern NC Friday\,
  April 10 - Sunday\, April 12\, 2026  \n \nAPPLICATION DEADLINE is February
  22\n \nEvent Overview\nThroughout North Carolina's early history\, many en
 slaved people carved out freedom for themselves\, some using the waterways\
 , swamps\, and diverse landscapes of eastern North Carolina as pathways to 
 liberation. This immersive weekend experience will highlight the courageous
  acts of resistance and resilience by those who escaped or aided others in 
 their journey to freedom.\n \nParticipants will explore the historical sign
 ificance of key sites\, including DNCR's Somerset Place and Historic Edento
 n\, delving into the stories of enslaved people like Harriet Jacobs and man
 y others. Through interaction with top scholars\, tours\, discussions\, and
  hands-on activities\, the workshop will weave together history and science
 \, connecting the natural ecology of the region—its rivers\, swamps\, and f
 orests—with the survival strategies of freedom seekers.\n \nAttendees will 
 also have the unique opportunity to canoe the very waterways enslaved peopl
 e navigated\, offering an immersive experience in the natural environment t
 hat shaped their journeys. Guided by DNCR's NC Museum of Natural Sciences\,
  teachers will gain insights into the region’s ecosystems and learn how wat
 erways and landscapes influenced the history\, culture and experiences of f
 reedom seekers. \n\nIn addition to examining the physical landscapes of res
 istance\, we will explore cultural strategies of survival and freedom\, suc
 h as the role of foodways in sustaining communities. We will be joined by A
 dé Carrena\, an award-winning chef\, culinary artist\, storyteller\, and fi
 lmmaker\, who will guide us through the rich tapestry of Southern culinary 
 traditions and their deep roots in African diasporic culture. As she leads 
 our group in preparing a shared meal\, participants will experience firstha
 nd how recipes became vessels of memory and resilience.\n\nEqually powerful
  is the role of music and spirituals\, songs that served as both comfort an
 d covert communication\, embedding directions and encouragement within thei
 r melodies. Acclaimed scholar and singer Mary D. Williams will join us for 
 a private performance sharing some of the spirituals that were a source of 
 strength through generations. These cultural practices were not mere expres
 sions of creativity\; they were acts of quiet defiance\, sustaining hope an
 d forging pathways to liberation.\n \nTeachers will leave with new perspect
 ives on integrating history\, culture\, science\, and nature into comprehen
 sive lessons\, as well as strategies for teaching the history of slavery an
 d freedom seeking in effective and responsible ways.\n \nAttending educator

 tion of Independence the City of Southport\, the Fort Johnston-Southport Mu
 seum & Visitors’ Center\, and the Brunswick Arts Council invite the communi
 ty to explore how art\, identity\, and history intertwine throughout our co

 r shared story.\n\nWhat You’ll Discover\n\nThe exhibition highlights how cr
 eativity has shaped and been shaped by American history over the past 250 y

 h artists and audiences to reflect on:\n\nHow historical events inspire cre
 ative expressionThe power of art and handicraft as a storytelling mediumThe

DESCRIPTION:In this course\, participants will learn how to keep track of t
 he code they use in their research using the version control system Git and
  the collaboration platform GitHub. Git allows you to keep track of changes
  to your code\, easily revert to previous versions\, and “tag” versions of 
 code used in publications so that the exact code used can be retrieved at a
  later date. GitHub allows Git users to collaborate with each other on proj
 ects by managing simultaneous changes to the same files and allowing users 
 to review and discuss each others’ code. Git and Github are applicable to a
 ny text-based programming or analysis language\, including R\, Python\, Sta
 ta\, Julia\, and others.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the “Modular 
 Design and Automated Testing with R” course in April.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: “Aftersun” (Charlotte Wells\, 2022)
DESCRIPTION:Set during a modest holiday at a Turkish resort in the early 2000s\, Aftersun approaches coming of age obliquely\, through memory and retrospection. Stunningly shot on 35mm film\, which is contrasted with mini DV home movie video footage\, the plot follows young Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her father Calum (Paul Mescal). But it is the adult Sophie’s somber attempt to reconstruct this formative trip that gives the story its emotional charge. Coming of age here is not marked by clear lessons or dramatic turning points\, but by the gradual\, dawning recognition of a parent’s fragility—and of the limits of childhood understanding. \n  \nThe film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at the Chelsea Theater\, 1129 Weaver Dairy Road\, Suite AB\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514. Click here for more information on theater pricing; tickets are free for UNC-Chapel Hill students. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series:\nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nSource: Ackland Art Museum

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Set during a modest holiday at a Turkish resort in the early 20
 00s\, Aftersun approaches coming of age obliquely\, through memory and retr
 ospection. Stunningly shot on 35mm film\, which is contrasted with mini DV 
 home movie video footage\, the plot follows young Sophie (Frankie Corio) an
 d her father Calum (Paul Mescal). But it is the adult Sophie’s somber attem
 pt to reconstruct this formative trip that gives the story its emotional ch
 arge. Coming of age here is not marked by clear lessons or dramatic turning
  points\, but by the gradual\, dawning recognition of a parent’s fragility—
 and of the limits of childhood understanding. \n  \nThe film will be introd
 uced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor a
 nd Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. 
 at the Chelsea Theater\, 1129 Weaver Dairy Road\, Suite AB\, Chapel Hill\, 
 NC 27514. Click here for more information on theater pricing\; tickets are 
 free for UNC-Chapel Hill students. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE
  credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the
  Series:\nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking 
 Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boy
 s Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience b
 y using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum 
 is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in 
 the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Have you had an argument with your spouse or significant other 
 that impacted your whole day? Maybe you had thoughts like\, “I’m such a jer
 k\,” or\, “All we do is fight.” Have you ever been stuck in traffic thanks 
 to an accident? Maybe you said to yourself\, “I knew I shouldn’t have gone 
 this way\,” or “This always happens to me.” Statements like these are commo
 n reactions to scenarios in our lives\, but they are inaccurate and distort
  how we see ourselves and the world around us. This session will examine th
 e 10 cognitive distortions and how they impact our mood and create faulty b
 eliefs about ourselves and the world around us. Join Learning and Organizat
 ional Development for a session where we will examine these distortions and
  identify ways to challenge negative thoughts and limit their impact on our
  lives.\n\nThis workshop is part of L&OD's LEAD Events\, an initiative that
  provides employees with opportunities to learn or refresh skills that can 
 help them grow their careers. LEAD Events are a component of L&OD's Leaders
 hip Education and Development\, or LEAD\, program.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:*IN-PERSON* SF/F Group
DESCRIPTION:Durham Writers Group\nWe will be at the People's Solidarity Hu
 b at 1809 Chapel Hill Rd\, Durham. This venue does not serve food or drink
 \, but feel free to bring your own. There is a kitchenette for our use\, b
 ut be sure to clean up afterwards. The space might be a little cozy\; plea
 se consider masking or staying home if you have a respiratory ailment.\n\n
 This sub-group focuses on Speculative Fiction\, including Science Fiction\
 , Fantasy and Horror. If you have anything that falls under that category 
 — be it short story\, poem\, novel-in-progress or screenplay — then co
 me! We'd love to hear from you.\n\nOur format allows each reader 15 minute
 s to present their work aloud\, followed by approximately 20 minutes of fe
 edback from the other attendees. To ensure fairness\, each attendee is lim
 ited to 1 minute of Initial Feedback time. During that period\, the author
  remains silent. Next\, we have a 5 minute Free-For-All discussion about t
 he work -- then the author may speak. (We usually get through three reader
 s.)\n\nThough not required\, in order to receive more in-depth feed-back\,
  readers may post their work in advance on our Google Group:\nhttps://grou
 ps.google.com/d/forum/durham-sff-writers-group\n\nWe ask that participants
  keep their comments constructive and respectful\, focusing on what works 
 or doesn't work in the piece.\n\nWe also ask that readers provide a warnin
 g\, both on the Google Group and during the meeting\, if their story featu
 res content that some readers might find upsetting. This includes descript
 ions of violence or sexual content.\n\nReaders are:\n•\n•\n•\n\nBack
 up Readers are:\n•\n•\n•\n\nDeep Backup:\n•\n\n***\n\n***We meet e
 very Tuesday at the same time\, but alternate between In-Person*** ***and 
 on Zoom. Members may attend both formats\, if desired\, but readers will b
 e listed separately under the In-Person or Zoom weeks.***\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Writers Group

SUMMARY:Travel CHINA like a local! Virtual QnA [x-posted]
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh & Triangle Activities Meetup Group\nPutting out feeler
 s for curious\, cooperative 'comrades' to explore quiet corners of Old Cat
 hay! Trip date TBD - waiting for airfares to come down.\n\nThis will happe
 n on Google Meet.\n\n**CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR MEETING LINK!**\n\n[Comment 
 if you are able to log onto the link but don't see me - in the past Google
  has let two meetings with the same link open\, each person thinking the o
 ther didn't show up. So comment here and we'll see if we can fix it. :-) ]
 \n\nI've been traveling to China for 27 years. Join me for a unique\, off 
 the beaten track culture immersion adventure!\n\nComfort NOT guaranteed! L
 OTS of walking! This trip is NOT for everyone but everyone who has come wi
 th me so far has LOVED it!\n\nItinerary NOT guaranteed so as to maximize e
 xperience! Spontaneous private zheng concert in a riverside pavilion? Let'
 s stop and enjoy! Weather is forecast to be rain in the mountains? Let's g
 o to the ancient village instead.\n\nCosts currently unknown but should be
  under $100/day for ALL in-country necessities: food\, lodging\, entrance 
 fees\, ground transport. Whatever price I end up quoting will NOT include 
 transport to/from China\, alcohol\, upgrades to lodging\\*\, upgrades to i
 n-country transport\\*.\n\nYou can do it cheaper with a big box tour. If s
 trict time schedules\, overpriced shopping\, industrial restaurant food\, 
 and being kept away from locals is good enough for you than that's your be
 st bet. If unique\, real China\, great food\, insider knowledge with eye f
 or western comforts\\*\\*\, and turn on a dime\\*\\*\\* [a mao?] escapades
  are for you than come with me!\n\nOnly seven people! Small and 'nimble'\\
 *\\*\\*!\n\nHave you already been to China? Already have seen the Forbidde
 n City and Great Wall? No worries! Big box tours do NOT go where I go!\n\n
 Have you never been to China and NEED to see the big sights? No problem! I
  can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall\, Forbidden City\,
  Temple of Heaven\, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hi
 dden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded pe
 ople so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers 
 with shop-hating history buffs\, or long distance hikers with casual strol
 lers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO t
 rips\, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/den
 y as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe
  next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to g
 et a hint of what one might see. No guarantees of ANYTHING! China changes 
 very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the
  beaten track. I said 'adventure'!\n\n\\*\\*Sometimes western comforts are
  just not there. Deep in the countryside villages rarely have western toil
 ets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Quick change of plans is relative in China\; western expe
 ctations are best set aside and an embrace the new/unknown/surprise attitu
 de is highly recommended. But that's what a cultural adventure is all abou
 t!\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh & Triangle Activities

 Books in Chapel Hill. A book-signing at 5:30 p.m. will precede the event.\n
 \n \n\nIt is newly estimated that 750\,000 soldiers died in the American Ci
 vil War. But less well-known than the war’s death toll are the roughly 400\
 ,000 Union and Confederate troops who were captured and imprisoned. Many PO
 Ws died from starvation\, dysentery\, and exposure\, and at the worst of th
 e prison pens\, more than 30\,000 soldiers were caged in the equivalent of 
 ten city block. "Fate Worse than Hell" contemplates the roots and consequen
 ces of this mass incarceration from America’s bloodiest conflict.\n\n \n\nB
 rundage will discuss the book with David Blight\, Sterling Professor of His
 tory at Yale University.\n\n \n\nRegister at the Flyleaf Books link.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Human bodies are composed of complex physiological architecture
  to support survival\, including a beating heart and a dynamic immune syste
 m. This same architecture also undergirds our everyday emotional lives\, af
 fecting how we infer each other’s emotional states and sense that our feeli
 ngs are “shared” in a given moment. In this talk\, Dr. Mallory Feldman will
  share the science of the body’s role in emotional experience\, and Dr. Cat
 herine Berman will discuss when and how co-experienced emotions (particular
 ly positive emotions) may shape well-being\, including in fleeting social i
 nteractions. Join us on Tuesday\, February 24\, from 6:00 to 7:00 PM at the

SUMMARY:The Agentic Shift: Designing AI That Can Reason\, Plan\, and Act
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nAs AI evolves from passive tools to acti
 ve collaborators\, enterprises face a pivotal shift: embracing systems tha
 t can not only respond but also take initiative. This webinar unpacks what
  it means to build and deploy agentic AI—models that possess goal-direct
 ed reasoning\, dynamic planning capabilities\, and the ability to autonomo
 usly execute tasks across complex workflows.\n\nWe’ll explore architectu
 ral and governance considerations for enterprise adoption\, including how 
 to integrate agentic systems into existing data ecosystems\, ensure transp
 arency and control\, and maintain human-in-the-loop oversight. Join us for
  a practical\, forward-looking discussion on how to prepare your organizat
 ion for AI that doesn’t just assist—but acts.\n\n**What You'll Learn:*
 *\n\n1️⃣ **What Agentic AI Really Means:** Understand the core compone
 nts—reasoning\, planning\, and autonomous action—and how they differ f

DESCRIPTION:Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith incr
 eased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come inc
 reased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within indi
 viduals. Additionally\, technological advances have made the collection of 
 person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interes
 ted in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day cours
 e focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions
  concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individ
 uals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time s
 eries data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily
  diary data\; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary s
 ampling (ESM)\; passive data from cell phones\; and other psychophysiologic
 al data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling fr
 ameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterati
 ve Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore pr
 ocesses as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-speci
 fic network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network
  models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks
  will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between meth
 ods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during th
 is course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series
  analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues
  with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFit
 ting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches fo
 r summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course
  is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling fram

DESCRIPTION:In this course\, participants will learn how to keep track of t
 he code they use in their research using the version control system Git and
  the collaboration platform GitHub. Git allows you to keep track of changes
  to your code\, easily revert to previous versions\, and “tag” versions of 
 code used in publications so that the exact code used can be retrieved at a
  later date. GitHub allows Git users to collaborate with each other on proj
 ects by managing simultaneous changes to the same files and allowing users 
 to review and discuss each others’ code. Git and Github are applicable to a
 ny text-based programming or analysis language\, including R\, Python\, Sta
 ta\, Julia\, and others.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the “Modular 
 Design and Automated Testing with R” course in April.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Voices Rising: Save Our Sounds (Greensboro)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Triad Wild! Chapter for a conversation about one of North Carolina’s most treasured natural resources: our estuarine sounds. Our sounds\, most notably the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound\, are known for their stunning coastal landscapes\, immense biodiversity\, historical significance\, economic importance\, and are the largest estuarine system in the nation managed by one state. Estuaries\, sometimes described as “rainforests of the sea”\, are crucial because they filter pollutants\, provide critical nurseries for fish and shellfish (supporting fisheries)\, as well as economic benefits through recreation\, tourism\, and jobs\, all while supporting immense biodiversity. Our shallow sounds are in deep trouble for several reasons\, not the least of which is our fisheries management. It’s not too late to recognize and to cherish North Carolina’s natural treasures for the gift they are and undertake-with dogged determination-the effort to restore their abundance\, for humans and the environment. Restoration is not a pipe dream; it is just waiting for us to get on board.  \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

DESCRIPTION:Join African-American Legacy Project Coordinator and award-winn
 ing textile artist Margarette Joyner as she leads workshop participants in 
 the art of crafting handmade dolls that replicate the ones enslaved women w
 ould have created for their own children. As Ms. Joyner states\, " “Hand se
 wing is becoming a dying art\, but there are many benefits to the art form.
   You’re using your hands and eyes in coordination\, which is great practic
 e for other activities. You’re also working on fine motor skills\, which ca
 n be helpful for tasks like handwriting and using a computer mouse.  But th
 e best thing about hand sewing is that it’s a relaxing activity. When you’r
 e focusing on the task at hand\, you can forget about all of your troubles 
 and just enjoy the moment. Sometimes it’s nice to take a break from thinkin
 g about things and just work on something creative.  So let’s learn how to 
 create a handmade doll similar to the primitive dolls made by the enslaved 
 women of Colonial Williamsburg.” \n\nThe activity will take place in Roseda
 le's kitchen cellar\, and seating is limited to 15. Materials will be provi
 ded.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:Department of Art and Art History\n\n \n\n“Like the Dawn of Cre
 ation: Byzantine Fragments in the Modern Imagination”\n\n \n\nThis talk exp
 lores how Byzantium operates as a queer cipher in modern culture\, appearin
 g as an adjectival modifier\, “the Byzantine\,” rather than as a distinct h
 istorical referent. Analyzing Gore Vidal’s 1959 adaptation of Tennessee Wil
 liams’s Suddenly\, Last Summer\, Betancourt demonstrates how Byzantine refe
 rences encode queer identity through the film’s absent protagonist\, whose 
 unspeakable sexuality mirrors Byzantium’s own unintelligibility. Drawing on
  extensive archival research\, he shows how “the Byzantine” articulated cod
 ed queerness for these writers and artists. This talk proposes reimagining 
 Byzantine art history through modes of “queer fragmentation\,” recognizing 
 Byzantine elements across temporal boundaries.\n\n \n\nRoland Betancourt is
  a scholar of Byzantium and modern popular culture with research that lies 
 firmly at the intersection of the history of science and technology\, intel
 lectual history\, and the history of art. Dr. Betancourt is the Andrew W. M
 ellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the 
 National Gallery of Art in Washington\, DC from 2024-2026. He also holds th
 e honor of Chancellor’s Professor\, Department of Art History\, at the Univ
 ersity of California\, Irvine. He is also the author of four monographs\, i
 ncluding The Secrets We Keep: Hidden Histories of the Byzantine Empire (The
  Getty\, 2024)\, Performing the Gospels in Byzantium: Sight\, Sound\, and S
 pace in the Divine Liturgy (Cambridge University Press\, 2021)\, Byzantine 
 Intersectionality: Sexuality\, Gender\, and Race in the Middle Ages (Prince
 ton University Press\, 2020)\, and Sight\, Touch\, and Imagination in Byzan
 tium (Cambridge University Press\, 2018). Betancourt’s forthcoming book\, D
 isneyland and the Rise of Automation: How Technology Created the Happiest P
 lace on Earth (Princeton University Press\, 2026)\, traces the origins and 
 evolution of the theme park’s technical innovations during Disneyland’s fir
 st three decades in operation\, exploring how engineers reimagined the syst
 ems and machines of industrial manufacturing and the military.\n\n \n\nA we
 eknight or daytime permit is now required after 5:00 pm on weekdays. No per
 mit is required from 5:00 pm Friday through 7:30 am Monday. A $1.00 one-nig
 ht pass is available in selected lots. More information can be found HERE.\

DESCRIPTION:The history of how the Declaration of Independence came to be i
 s familiar to many Americans.\nLess familiar and equally important is the s
 ubsequent history of the document. How did the Declaration go from being a 
 congressional PR document of moderate significance to becoming the defining
  document of American history and one of the most influential documents in 
 the history of the world.\n\nThough it served an important purpose in 1776\
 , the Declaration was not particularly noted or celebrated in the decades a
 fter the Revolution.\n\nIn this talk\, historian Michael D. Hattem will dis
 cuss how groups from across the political spectrum have redefined the Decla
 ration and its ideals in an effort to make them more relevant and meaningfu
 l to their own times. In the process\, he will show how the Declaration bec
 ame "American Scripture\," as well as a model for independence-seeking peop
 le around the world.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin
  [Harpreet Sahota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harpreetsahota204/) for a v
 irtual workshop to learn how to use Facebook's Action100M dataset and Fift
 yOne to build an end-to-end workflow.\n\n**Date\, Time and Location**\n\nF
 eb 26\, 2026\n9am - 10am Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https
 ://voxel51.com/events/exploring-video-datasets-with-fiftyone-and-vision-la
 nguage-models-february-26-2026)**\n\nVideo is the hardest modality to work
  with. You're dealing with more data\, temporal complexity\, and annotatio
 n workflows that don't scale. This hands-on workshop tackles a practical q
 uestion: given a large video dataset\, how do you understand what's in it 
 without manually watching thousands of clips?\n\nIn this workshop you'll l
 earn how to:\n\n* **Navigate and explore** video data in the FiftyOne App\
 , filter samples\, and understand dataset structure\n* **Compute embedding
 s** with Qwen3-VL to enable semantic search\, zero-shot classification\, a
 nd clustering\n* **Generate descriptions and localize events** using visio
 n-language models like Qwen3-VL and Molmo2\n* **Visualize patterns** in yo
 ur data through embedding projections and the FiftyOne App\n* **Evaluate m
 odel outputs** against Action100M's hierarchical annotations to validate w
 hat the models actually capture\n\nBy the end of the session\, you'll have
  a reusable toolkit for understanding any video dataset at scale\, whether
  you're curating training data\, debugging model performance\, or explorin
 g a new domain.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

DESCRIPTION:Knowing how to develop various types of qualitative research st
 udies to respond to complex research and community priorities is rewarding\
 , but can also be daunting. This short course provides practical skills for
  conducting various types of qualitative research in U.S. and international
  settings. First\, students will learn about the epistemological and theore
 tical foundations of qualitative research and the range of methodologies cu
 rrently used such as programmatic qualitative research\, ethnography\, grou
 nded theory\, phenomenology\, and case studies. Next\, the short course pro
 vides step-by-step instructions on how to develop and implement various qua
 litative methods and designs\, such as interviews\, focus groups\, and obse
 rvations – and how to handle single- versus multi-method qualitative studie
 s or cross-sectional versus longitudinal qualitative studies. Students will
  learn basic principles for data generation\, ethics\, and data quality in 
 qualitative studies. We will also focus on practical steps for data analysi
 s\, including data management\, transcription\, and coding. Traditionally\,
  qualitative research is conducted in-person\, and students will be trained
  for in-person interactions. However\, the short course’s concluding module
  teaches students about techniques required for contemporary qualitative re
 search online and by phone\, including consideration of recent advances in 
 conducting qualitative research using social media. This course is designed
  to provide new knowledge for both introductory and intermediate students. 
 Registration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link a
 ccess.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Grief is often linked to death\, but many of life’s losses are 
 quieter and less visible—changes in identity\, shifting roles\, unmet expec
 tations\, and transitions that leave lasting marks. Led jointly by a facult
 y researcher and a campus chaplain\, this seminar explores grief as a share
 d human experience\, drawing on research-based insights alongside reflectiv
 e and compassionate practices. Participants will examine how grief shapes i
 dentity\, relationships\, and sense of purpose\, while learning practical w
 ays to navigate loss in their own lives. The session will also consider how
  individuals and communities can create space for grief in supportive\, mea
 ningful ways. Participants will leave with concrete tools for honoring loss
 \, fostering resilience\, and sustaining compassion and continuity through 
 periods of change.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

 s\, but its principal author\, Thomas Jefferson\, owned slaves\, and the De
 claration refers to Native Americans as “merciless savages.” How should we 
 think about this founding paradox that has haunted the nation for 250 years

DESCRIPTION:Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith incr
 eased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come inc
 reased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within indi
 viduals. Additionally\, technological advances have made the collection of 
 person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interes
 ted in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day cours
 e focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions
  concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individ
 uals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time s
 eries data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily
  diary data\; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary s
 ampling (ESM)\; passive data from cell phones\; and other psychophysiologic
 al data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling fr
 ameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterati
 ve Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore pr
 ocesses as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-speci
 fic network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network
  models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks
  will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between meth
 ods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during th
 is course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series
  analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues
  with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFit
 ting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches fo
 r summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course
  is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling fram
 eworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples 
 with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to gi
 ve learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\
 nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link 
 access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:The 11th Annual Symposium of the Art Student Graduate Organization - “Anachronic Enchantment: Temporalities in Visual and Material Culture"
DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday\, February 28 from 9:00 AM- 2:30 PM. Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general audience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to say that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essentially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However\, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, meaning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachronistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachronic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\, adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameters of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this symposium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdisciplinary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with temporality to construct new and alternative histories; how meaning and interpretation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own scholarly and curatorial practices; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: Ackland Art Museum

SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Species Removal (Roper)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Wildlife Habitat Stewards of Northeastern NC Chapter and Spruill Conservation Farm for a hands-on habitat restoration project on Saturday\, February 28\, from 10 am to 12 pm. Together\, volunteers will focus on removing invasive heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) along the farm’s wooded nature trail. \nHeavenly bamboo poses a threat to local ecosystems as it spreads quickly when birds eat its berries and disperse the seeds\, allowing dense thickets to form that crowd out native plants and reduce habitat quality for wildlife. Its berries are also highly toxic\, releasing cyanide when eaten\, and birds such as cedar waxwings have been known to die after consuming large quantities. \nThis volunteer effort will involve digging\, prying\, cutting\, and lifting plant roots\, so participants should be prepared for physical activity. It’s a great opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the trail and the wildlife that depends on it.\n \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North
  Carolina at Chapel Hill on\nSaturday\, February 28 from 9:00 AM- 2:30 PM. 
 Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general a
 udience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to sa
 y that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essen
 tially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. Howeve
 r\, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, me
 aning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachr
 onistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachro
 nic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\
 , adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the paramete
 rs of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this sympos
 ium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdiscipl
 inary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented
  across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to
  interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how
  alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to 
 this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with tempo
 rality to construct new and alternative histories\; how meaning and interpr
 etation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own s
 cholarly and curatorial practices\; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt 
 and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North
  Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday\, February 28 from 9:00 AM- 2:30 PM. P
 resentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general au
 dience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to say
  that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essent
 ially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However
 \, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, mea
 ning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachro
 nistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachron
 ic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\,
  adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameter
 s of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this symposi
 um considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdiscipli
 nary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented 
 across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to 
 interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how 
 alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to t
 his inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with tempor
 ality to construct new and alternative histories\; how meaning and interpre
 tation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own sc
 holarly and curatorial practices\; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt a
 nd complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Early Spring Meander at Swift Creek Bluffs
DESCRIPTION:Take a stroll through the calming scenery of Swift Creek Bluffs!\nWith a focus on looking for signs of spring\, we will saunter rather than power-walk through the woods. Join TLC Trail Guide and naturalist\, Julie Hall\, to walk slowly for 1.5 miles and stop for moments of silence to appreciate the nourishing wonder and beauty of nature!  You will have an opportunity to hike up the "Stairway to Heaven" and take in the lush hardwood canopy and meandering Swift Creek below\, while sitting on a bench at the top of the 100-ft bluffs. \n\nThis is a free event\, but preregistration is required. Due to the size of the parking lot\, we will keep the hiking group small and ask that you register by vehicle rather than individual. Feel free to bring guests but please carpool to ensure we have enough space in the parking lot.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf registration is full\, please fill out this waitlist form by February 26th.\n\nCurrent Mask Policy: TLC seeks to build a supportive\, mask-friendly environment in all collaborations with staff and the public. Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated\, or if that makes you feel most comfortable. We will have masks available if you would like to wear one during an event. We also encourage those eligible to be vaccinated to get their Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. If you are experiencing any Covid-related symptoms\, please stay home and attend a program another day. Our top priority is to create a safe environment for our community. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nSource: Triangle Land Conservancy

SUMMARY:Lunch and Learn: How Small Orgs and Non-Profits are Getting Value 
 out of AI 
DESCRIPTION:All Things AI (Live)\nSmall organizations and nonprofits face 
 mounting pressure to adopt AI while operating on tight budgets without ded
 icated tech teams. Their bilingual\, client-facing staff already juggle di
 rect service\, paperwork\, and community outreach—they're not writing co
 de\, and they shouldn't have to.\nThis session explores what AI adoption a
 ctually looks like in that reality. Drawing on hands-on projects with nonp
 rofits and minority-owned small businesses\, Will demonstrates how to iden
 tify high-value use cases\, design AI workflows *with* staff rather than *
 for* them\, and introduce new tools without creating overwhelm.\nExamples 
 include Spanish-English workflows for grant writing\, documentation and re
 porting\, and day-to-day communication with clients and partners.\n\n**Par
 ticipants will leave with:**\n\n* Patterns that reliably work in low-tech 
 environments\n* Practical guardrails for privacy and quality\n* Ready-to-a
 dapt prompts and process maps to bring back to their teams\n\nSource: Meetup: All Things AI

SUMMARY:March 5 - AI\, ML and Computer Vision Meetup
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin
  our virtual meetup to hear talks from experts on cutting-edge topics acro
 ss AI\, ML\, and computer vision.\n\n**Date and Location**\n\nMar 5\, 2026
 \n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.co
 m/events/ai-ml-and-computer-vision-meetup-march-5-2026)**\n\n**MOSPA: Huma
 n Motion Generation Driven by Spatial Audio**\n\nEnabling virtual humans t
 o dynamically and realistically respond to diverse auditory stimuli remain
 s a key challenge in character animation\, demanding the integration of pe
 rceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its significance\, this ta
 sk remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused 
 on mapping modalities like speech\, audio\, and music to generate human mo
 tion. As of yet\, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial fe
 atures encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion.\n\nTo bridge this
  gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to sp
 atial audio\, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Hu
 man Motion (SAM) dataset\, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial
  audio and motion data. For benchmarking\, we develop a simple yet effecti
 ve diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven
  by SPatial Audio\, termed MOSPA\, which faithfully captures the relations
 hip between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mech
 anism. Once trained\, MOSPA can generate diverse\, realistic human motions
  conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough invest
 igation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benc
 hmarking\, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this 
 task.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Zhiyang (Frank) Dou](https://www.linkedin
 .com/in/zhiyang-frank-dou-0259111b3/) is a Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL\, ad
 vised by Prof. Wojciech Matusik. I work with the Computational Design and 
 Fabrication Group and the Computer Graphics Group.\n\n**Securing the Auton
 omous Future: Navigating the Intersection of Agentic AI\, Connected Device
 s\, and Cyber Resilience**\n\nWith billions of devices now in our infrastr
 ucture and emerging as autonomous agents (AI)\, we face a very real questi
 on: How can we create intelligent systems that are both secure and trusted
 ? This talk will explore the intersection of agentic AI and IoT and demons
 trate how the same AI systems can provide robust defense mechanisms. At it
 s core\, however\, this is a challenge about trusting people with technolo
 gy\, ensuring their safety\, and providing accountability. Therefore\, cre
 ating a new way of thinking is required\, one in which security is built i
 n\, and where autonomous action has oversight\; and\, ultimately\, innovat
 ion leads to greater human well-being.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Samaresh
  Kumar Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samaresh-singh-9772ba23/) is an 
 engineering principal at HP Inc. with more than 21 years of experience in 
 designing and implementing large-scale distributed systems\, cloud native 
 platform systems\, and edge AI / ML systems. His expertise includes agenti
 c AI systems\, GenAI / LLMs\, Edge AI\, federated and privacy preserving l
 earning\, and secure hybrid cloud / edge computing.\n\n**Plugins as Produc
 ts: Bringing Visual AI Research into Real-World Workflows with FiftyOne**\
 n\nVisual AI research often introduces new datasets\, models\, and analysi
 s methods\, but integrating these advances into everyday workflows can be 
 challenging. FiftyOne is a data-centric platform designed to help teams ex
 plore\, evaluate\, and improve visual AI\, and its plugin ecosystem is how
  the platform scales beyond the core. In this talk\, we explore the FiftyO
 ne plugin ecosystem from both perspectives: how users apply plugins to acc
 elerate data-centric workflows\, and how researchers and engineers can pac
 kage their work as plugins to make it easier to share\, reproduce\, and bu
 ild upon. Through practical examples\, we show how plugins turn research a
 rtifacts into reusable components that integrate naturally into real-world
  visual AI workflows.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Adonai Vera](https://www.

 nsforming Business with Agentic AI**\n\nAgentic AI is reshaping business o
 perations by employing autonomous systems that learn\, adapt\, and optimiz
 e processes independently of human input. This session examines the essent
 ial differences between traditional AI agents and Agentic AI\, emphasizing
  their significance for project professionals overseeing digital transform
 ation initiatives. Real-world examples from eCommerce\, insurance\, and he
 althcare illustrate how autonomous AI achieves measurable outcomes across 
 industries. The session addresses practical orchestration patterns in whic
 h specialized AI agents collaborate to resolve complex business challenges
  and enhance operational efficiency. Attendees will receive a practical fr
 amework for identifying high-impact use cases\, developing infrastructure\
 , establishing governance\, and scaling Agentic AI within their organizati

SUMMARY:From Data Governance to Semantic Intelligence
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nAs AI adoption accelerates\, many enterp
 rises are hitting the same wall: traditional approaches to data governance
 \, metadata management\, and cataloging were not designed to support AI an
 d AI agents operating at scale. Fragmented tools\, siloed semantics\, and 
 inconsistent definitions make it difficult for both people and AI systems 
 to trust and act on data.\n\nIn this webinar\, industry expert Mike Fergus
 on and Collate co-founder and CEO Suresh Srinivas explore how leading orga
 nizations are evolving from tool-centric data catalogs and governance towa
 rd semantic intelligence\, a unified approach that brings governance\, con
 text\, and meaning together to support analytics\, automation\, and AI at 
 scale.\n\nCollate co-founder and CTO Harsha Chintalapani will also provide
  a brief demonstration showing how semantic intelligence is applied in pra
 ctice\, including how data teams design and build AI agents on governed en
 terprise data.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ Why data discovery\, g
 overnance\, lineage\, and data quality and observability must work togethe
 r to support AI-driven use cases\n\n2️⃣ How fragmented semantic layers
  and tool-specific context limit trust\, scale\, and reuse across analytic
 s and AI\n\n3️⃣What semantic intelligence means in practice and how it
  extends beyond traditional data catalogs\n\n4️⃣How shared meaning ena
 bles secure\, governed access to data for both people and AI agents\n\n5
 ️⃣How semantic intelligence supports the delivery of trusted\, consuma
 ble data products with meaning\, quality signals\, and governance that are
  ready for analytics and AI agents\n\n6️⃣What it takes to make data tr
 uly AI-ready without sacrificing control\, compliance\, or consistency\n\n
 Designed for data leaders\, enterprise architects\, and governance teams\,
  this session explains why existing catalogs and governance tools remain u
 seful—but are no longer sufficient on their own—and how enterprises ca
 n operationalize shared meaning to support analytics\, data engineering\, 
 and AI initiatives at scale.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042D1NJ

DESCRIPTION:Organizations are investing in benefits to improve employee wel
 l-being and taking on initiatives to foster a culture of well-being in the 
 workplace. However\, many employees still feel that their job is an obstacl
 e to their well-being rather than a help. What can you do as a manager to s
 hift that perception? Join Learning and Organizational Development for a se
 ssion that will provide practical ways to show employees that you and your 
 organization support their well-being.\n\nThis workshop is part of L&OD's L
 EAD Events\, an initiative that provides employees with opportunities to le
 arn or refresh skills that can help them grow their careers. LEAD Events ar
 e a component of L&OD's Leadership Education and Development\, or LEAD\, pr

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

 has a growing collection of canned and bottled brews\, ciders\, and colas 
 in addition to their in-house-brewed meads. There are also some snacks lik

 you do\, please mark them as containing any common allergens.\n\nOutside f
 ood (delivered\, brought in\, or homemade) is welcomed and encouraged. Out
 side drinks are not. Since the venue does not prepare food\, **dogs are al
 lowed and welcomed.** (Dogs are very friendly and welcoming\, too\, but th
 ey mostly roam around to collect ear scritches and love. If you're not com
 fortable with dogs around\, let us know\, and we'll try to accommodate.)\n
 \nBring games\, friends\, and a welcoming spirit. We're excited to have yo
 u with us!\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Geeks

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: "Boyhood" (Richard Linklater\, 2014)
DESCRIPTION:Filmed over twelve years with the same cast members who conspicuously age from segment to segment\, Boyhood offers one of cinema’s most literal and radical explorations of coming of age. Following Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from early childhood through his first days of college\, the film refuses traditional narrative climaxes in favor of accumulation: small moments\, shifting family dynamics\, and incremental changes in perception as time itself figures as the “main character.” Linklater’s method allows us to experience maturation as something lived\, uneven\, and quietly profound. \nThe film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at The Lumina Theater (620 Market St\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27516). \nTickets are free for all audience members\, and registration is required via The Lumina’s webpage. Please click here to reserve your free ticket. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men.

DESCRIPTION:Broken Beakers and Brilliant Minds: Fixing The Machinery of Sci
 ence \n\n  \n\nFrom the energy crisis and feeding eight billion people to d
 efeating cancer and coping with climate change\, humanity faces some rather
  large challenges today. To tackle them\, we need science running like a we
 ll-oiled machine. Unfortunately\, it has more often resembled a clunky old 
 engine: loud\, temperamental and prone to breaking down at the worst possib
 le moment. \n\n  \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding cuts for scienc
 e’s current woes\, but focusing only on money rather misses the point. Many
  of science’s biggest problems have been around for years\, sometimes centu
 ries. Scientists have long been criticized\, sidelined or attacked for havi
 ng ideas that were too new\, too inconvenient or simply too correct for the
  people in power at the time. Even truly unscientific behaviors\, like char
 acter assassination and fraud\, are not modern inventions… though they do s
 eem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance. \n\n  \n\nThe good news is that l
 ongstanding problems are not the same as unsolvable ones. Join Matt Kaplan\
 , science correspondent at The Economist and author of I Told You So! Scien
 tists Who Were Ridiculed\, Exiled and Imprisoned… For Being Right\, for a s
 pirited and insightful talk on the history of these endemic issues and what
  we can do to finally consign them to the scientific scrap heap.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:after work bike ride on the ATT 
DESCRIPTION:Triangle Hiking and Outdoors Group\nI know that it’s hard to
  imagine\, given the weather we’ve had from. Mid January to almost mid F
 ebruary\, but it’s time to prepare for the 2026 season of the Tuesday af
 ter work bike rides. This seasonal\, weekly event has been going on since 
 2011! It will begin with just over 1 hour of riding\, and as the days get 
 longer we’ll increase the ride time and distance tracking sunset.\nWe'll
  be starting near Southpoint and final starting point will be sent out Mon
 day evening. Make sure that your bike is in good working order - tires hol
 d air and are up to pressure\, brakes and shifters work and your chain has
  been oiled. We'll be riding just about 1 hours and about 12 miles. The ri
 de is fairly flat and shaded and our pace will be moderate (about 13 mph a
 verage). I recommend a hard tail or hybrid bike\, but if you really want t
 o bring a road bike it's ok\, though you'll likely be a bit bored. Unicycl
 es....? I'll be eating after the ride at a restaurant. You're welcome to j
 oin me if you like. Helmets are required and by signing up you agree to TH
 OG liability waiver statement. Please Note!! Any cancellation less than 30
  hours before the beginning of the event will be considered a "no show"\n\nSource: Meetup: Triangle Hiking & Outdoors

 me! We'd love to hear from you.\n\nOur format allows each reader 15 minute
 s to present their work aloud\, followed by approximately 20 minutes of fe
 edback from the other attendees. To ensure fairness\, each attendee is lim
 ited to 1 minute of Initial Feedback time. During that period\, the author
  remains silent. Next\, we have a 5 minute Free-For-All discussion about t
 he work -- then the author may speak. (We usually get through three reader
 s.)\n\nThough not required\, in order to receive more in-depth feed-back\,
  readers may post their work in advance on our Google Group:\nhttps://grou
 ps.google.com/d/forum/durham-sff-writers-group\n\nWe ask that participants
  keep their comments constructive and respectful\, focusing on what works 
 or doesn't work in the piece.\n\nWe also ask that readers provide a warnin
 g\, both on the Google Group and during the meeting\, if their story featu

SUMMARY:March 11 - Strategies for Validating World Models and Action-Condi
 tioned Video
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin
  us for a one hour hands-on workshop where we will explore emerging challe
 nges in developing and validating world foundation models and video-genera
 tion AI systems for robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\n**Time and Locati
 on**\n\nMar 11\, 2026\n10-11am PST\nOnline\, **[Register for the Zoom!](ht
 tps://voxel51.com/events/debugging-the-future-strategies-for-validating-wo
 rld-models-and-action-conditioned-video-march)**\n\nIndustries from roboti
 cs to autonomous vehicles are converging on world foundation models (WFMs)
  and action-conditioned video generation\, where the challenge is predicti
 ng physics\, causality\, and intent. But this shift has created a massive 
 new bottleneck: validation.\n\nHow do you debug a model that imagines the 
 future? How do you curate petabyte-scale video datasets to capture the "lo
 ng tail" of rare events without drowning in storage costs? And how do you 
 ensure temporal consistency when your training data lives in scattered dat
 a lakes?\n\nIn this session\, we explore technical workflows for the next 
 generation of Visual AI. We will dissect the "Video Data Monster\," demons
 trating how to build feedback loops that bridge the gap between generative
  imagination and physical reality. Learn how leading teams are using feder
 ated data strategies and collaborative evaluation to turn video from a sto
 rage burden into a structured\, queryable asset for embodied intelligence.
 \n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Nick Lotz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nichola

 echnical Marketing Engineer at Voxel51. He is particularly interested in b
 ringing observability and security to all layers of the AI stack.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

SUMMARY:Spring Wildflower Hike
DESCRIPTION:Join TLC on an exploration of Swift Creek Bluffs to see what's in bloom!\nCome and explore the ephemeral beauties and early bloomers that carpet the preserve this time of year with TLC Trail Guide Mary Abrams. You are encouraged to bring plant ID guides and have apps such as iNaturalist and Seek downloaded to your mobile device for extra help identifying your findings. We will walk less than 1 mile\, but the climb up the stairway to heaven will provide a challenge—and reward us with great views. This is a free event\, but preregistration is required.\n\nDue to the size of the parking lot\, we will keep the hiking group small and ask that you register by vehicle rather than individual. Feel free to bring guests but please carpool to ensure we have enough space in the parking lot.\n\n\n\nIf registration is full\, please fill out this waitlist form by March 11th at 10am.\n\nCurrent Mask Policy: TLC seeks to build a supportive\, mask-friendly environment in all collaborations with staff and the public. Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated\, or if that makes you feel most comfortable. We will have masks available if you would like to wear one during an event. We also encourage those eligible to be vaccinated to get their Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. If you are experiencing any Covid-related symptoms\, please stay home and attend a program another day. Our top priority is to create a safe environment for our community. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nSource: Triangle Land Conservancy

SUMMARY:March 12 - Agents\, MCP and Skills Virtual Meetup
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin
  us for a special edition of the AI\, ML and Computer Vision Meetup where 
 we will focus on Agents\, MCP and Skills!\n\n**Date\, Time\, Location**\n\
 nMar 12\, 2026\n9 - 11 AM PST\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://
 voxel51.com/events/mcp-and-skills-meetup-march-12-2026)**\n\n**Agents Buil
 ding Agents on the Hugging Face Hub**\n\nDiscover how coding agents can ru
 n or support your fine-tuning experiments. From quick dataset validation a
 nd preprocessing\, to optimal GPU hardware selection\, to automated job su
 bmission based on metric tracking\, to evaluation. Ben will demonstrate ho
 w Hugging Face skills can be used to define best practices for agents to s
 upport machine learning experiments. Bring Claude\, Codex\, or Mistral Vib
 es\, and we’ll show you to get it training models with GRPO\, SFT\, and 
 DPO.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Ben Burtenshaw](https://www.linkedin.com/i
 n/ben-burtenshaw/) is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face\, focusi
 ng on building agents with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. He led 
 educational projects like the Agents Course\, the MCP Course\, and the LLM
  course\, which bridge the gap between complex Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  techniques and practical application. Ben focuses on democratizing access
  to efficient AI\, empowering the community to align\, evaluate\, and depl
 oy transparent agentic systems.\n\n**Claude Code Templates**\n\nThis talk 
 explores how to configure and align Claude Code agents using templates and
  custom components. I'll demonstrate practical configuration patterns that
  ensure your CLI agent executes exactly what you intend\, covering Skills 
 setup\, hooks implementation\, and template customization. Drawing from re
 al-world examples building Claude Code Templates\, attendees will learn ho
 w to structure their agent configurations for consistent\, reliable behavi
 or and create reusable components that maintain alignment across different
  use cases.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Daniel Avila](https://www.linkedin.
 com/in/daniel-avila-arias/) is an AI Engineer at Hedgineer building agenti
 c systems and creator of Claude Code Templates.\n\n**Move Faster in Comput
 er Vision by Teaching Agents to See Your Data**\n\nComputer vision teams s
 pend too much time writing scripts just to find bad labels\, blurry images
 \, and edge cases. In this talk\, I’ll show how to move that work to age
 nts by using FiftyOne as a visual operating system. With Skills and MCP\, 
 agents can see inside your datasets\, explore them visually\, and handle c
 ommon data cleanup tasks\, so you can spend less time on data and more tim
 e shipping models.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Adonai Vera](https://www.lin
 kedin.com/in/adonai-vera/) \\- Machine Learning Engineer & DevRel at Voxel
 51\\. With over 7 years of experience building computer vision and machine
  learning models using TensorFlow\\\, Docker\\\, and OpenCV\\. I started a
 s a software developer\\\, moved into AI\\\, led teams\\\, and served as C
 TO\\. Today\\\, I connect code and community to build open\\\, production\
 \-ready AI\\\, making technology simple\\\, accessible\\\, and reliable\\.
 \n\n**Skills As Documentation**\n\nSkills are self-contained recipes - eac
 h one a piece of a larger puzzle. Instead of trying to modify human-centri
 c documentation to better fit agents\, skills let us build capabilities in
 to our agents directly. This talk will showcase how to think about leverag
 ing skills to enhance how users interact with your software!\n\n*About the
  Speaker*\n\n[Chris Alexiuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csalexiuk/) is a 
 deep learning developer advocate at NVIDIA\, working on creating technical
  assets that help developers use the incredible suite of AI tools availabl
 e at NVIDIA. Chris comes from a machine learning and data science backgrou
 nd\, and he is obsessed with everything and anything about large language 
 models.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Plug and Play: A Guide to Planting Perennial Plugs (virtual)
DESCRIPTION:Most gardeners are familiar with planting container-grown perennials\, but using plugs requires a shift in mindset and technique. These young starter plants\, grown in trays instead of pots\, offer distinct advantages: they are cost-effective\, easier to plant and establish quickly. They are ideal for large areas\, slopes and under trees. However\, not every gardener is familiar with plugs. Planting them successfully takes a bit of practical know-how that even experienced gardeners will appreciate refining. Join Shannon Currey\, education and outreach at Izel Native Plant\, to learn the pros and cons of plugs\, when they’re most appropriate and best practices for handling\, planting and managing them. With these essentials\, you’ll be planting like a pro! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

SUMMARY:March 19 - Women in AI Meetup
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nHear
  talks from experts on the latest topics in AI\, ML\, and computer vision 
 on March 19th.\n\n**Date and Location**\n\nMar 19\, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacifi
 c\nOnline. **[Register for Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/women-in-ai-m
 eetup-march-19-2026)**\n\n**Towards Reliable Clinical AI: Evaluating Factu
 ality\, Robustness\, and Real-World Performance of Large Language Models**
 \n\nLarge language models are increasingly deployed in clinical settings\,
  but their reliability remains uncertain—they hallucinate facts\, behave
  inconsistently across instruction phrasings\, and struggle with evolving 
 medical terminology. In my talk\, I address methods to systematically eval
 uate clinical LLM reliability across four dimensions aligned with how heal
 thcare professionals actually work: verifying concrete facts (FactEHR)\, e
 nsuring stable guidance across instruction variations (instruction sensiti
 vity study showing up to 0.6 AUROC variation)\, integrating up-to-date kno
 wledge (BEACON improving biomedical NER by 15%)\, and assessing real patie
 nt conversations (PATIENT-EVAL revealing models abandon safety warnings wh
 en patients seek reassurance). These contributions establish evaluation st
 andards spanning factuality\, robustness\, knowledge integration\, and pat
 ient-centered communication\, charting a path toward clinical AI that is s
 afer\, more equitable\, and more trustworthy.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[M
 onica Munnangi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monicamunnangi/) is a doctoral
  student at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern Univer
 sity\, advised by Saiph Savage. Her doctoral research\, which she began in
  2021 and expects to complete in 2026\, focuses on multi-modal machine lea
 rning for healthcare. After being introduced to artificial intelligence an
 d machine learning during her undergraduate studies\, Munnangi earned her 
 master’s degree from UMass Amherst.\n\n**Neural BRDFs: Learning Compact 
 Representations for Material Appearance**\n\nAccurately modeling how light
  interacts with real-world materials remains a central challenge in render
 ing. Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) describe how
  materials reflect light as a function of viewing and lighting directions.
  Creating realistic digital materials has traditionally required choosing 
 between fast parametric models that can't capture real-world complexity\, 
 or massive measured BRDFs that are expensive to acquire and store. Neural 
 BRDFs address this challenge by learning continuous reflectance functions 
 from data\, exploiting directional correlations and symmetry to achieve si
 gnificant compression while maintaining rendering quality. In this talk\, 
 we examine how neural networks can encode complex material behavior compac
 tly\, why this matters for rendering and material capture\, and how neural
  BRDFs fit into the broader evolution toward data-driven graphics.\n\n*Abo
 ut the Speaker*\n\n[Manushree Gangwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manushr
 eegangwar/) is a Machine Learning Engineer at Voxel51 working on data-cent
 ric visual AI. She holds an MS in Computer Science from Columbia Universit
 y and has previously worked in robotics\, autonomous driving\, and AR/VR\,
  with a focus on scene understanding and 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Superchar
 ging AI agents with evaluations**\n\nReliable deployment of AI agents depe
 nds on rigorous evaluation\, which must shift from a nice-to-have QA step 
 to a core engineering discipline. Robust evaluation is essential for safet
 y\, predictability\, misuse resistance\, and sustained user trust. To meet
  this bar\, Evals must be deeply integrated into the agent development lif
 ecycle. This talk will outline how simulation-based testing—using high-f
 idelity\, controllable environments—provides the next generation of eval
 uation infrastructure for production-ready AI agents.\n\n*About the Speake
 r*\n\n[Priya Venkat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priya26/)\, PhD\, is a Se
 nior AI Manager at Intuit\, where she leads teams that build and scale ML 
 and Agentic AI systems for finance. Her work integrates cutting-edge agent
 ic workflows and robust evaluation systems to drive business impact while 
 ensuring AI safety and reliability. Priya is a strong advocate of responsi
 ble AI\, and actively mentors the next generation of AI scientists and eng
 ineers.\n\n**Language Diffusion Models**\n\nAutoregressive models (ARMs) a
 re widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). Cha
 llenge this notion by introducing LLaDA\, a diffusion model trained from s
 cratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. L
 LaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a rev
 erse process\, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked to
 kens. Optimizing a likelihood bound provides a principled generative appro
 ach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks\, LLaDA demon
 strates strong scalability\, outperforming self-constructed ARM baselines.
  Remarkably\, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in i
 n-context learning and\, after SFT\, exhibits impressive instruction-follo

DESCRIPTION:Join NC State Industry Extension Services for a webinar that wi
 ll focus on smart manufacturing and the opportunities available through a f
 ederally funded grant for small and medium-sized manufacturers in North Car
 olina who are ready to adopt technology. The webinar's goal is to provide t
 argeted technical assistance to small- to medium-sized manufacturers to inc
 rease awareness of\, access to and implementation of innovative smart manuf
 acturing technologies. The benefits of smart manufacturing are:\n\nImproved
  efficiency: Smart factories can monitor equipment performance and automate
  complex processes\, improving accuracy and reducing human error.Increased 
 productivity: Smart factories can use data to identify issues\, such as whe
 n a machine slows down production and then use artificial intelligence syst
 ems to resolve the issues.Long-term cost savings: Smart factories can use p
 redictive maintenance to identify potential problems early and address them
  at a convenient time\, which can save money.Greater flexibility: Smart fac
 tories can scale production quickly to meet changing demand and can customi
 ze products to meet specific customer needs.You can complete a short applic
 ation to find out if your company is ready to participate in the program. F
 or more information about the webinar\, visit the NC State Industry Extensi
 on Services' website.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:CSA Triangle March Meetup - Sponsored by Tines
DESCRIPTION:Cloud Security Alliance Triangle Chapter\nAutomating the Cloud
  Controls Matrix: From Deterministic Audits to AI Agents\n\nModernizing GR
 C by evolving static risk workflows into intelligent AI agents that map se
 curity alerts directly to CSA standards\n\nSummary of Presentation:\n\nDes
 pite the rise of AI\, "manual work remains stubbornly high" for security t
 eams. This session demonstrates how to bridge the gap between CSA Cloud Au
 diting (CCAK) and practical automation by building a three-stage GRC pipel
 ine in Tines:\n1\\. The Foundation \\(Deterministic\\): We begin by ingest
 ing raw cloud alerts and creating a standardized "Risk Register using Tine
 s Records"\\\, ensuring every violation is captured without manual entry\\
 .\n2\\. The Intelligence \\(AI Agent\\): We upgrade the workflow with an A
 I Agent action\\. Because "Agents shouldn’t be a black box"\\\, we expli
 citly instruct it to map alerts to the Cloud Controls Matrix’s "197 cont
 rol objectives" and recommend remediation\\.\n3\\. The Interaction \\(AI C
 hatbot\\): We conclude by deploying an "AI interaction layer"\\. This allo
 ws auditors to query their compliance data using natural language \\(e\\.g
 \\.\\\, "Show me all GDPR risks"\\)\\\, effectively "unlocking AI’s full
  value" for the audit process\n\nSource: Meetup: Cloud Security Alliance Triangle

  a half of a mile before entering the woods. Once in the woods there is no 
 defined trail\, but the terrain is relatively flat and the vegetation will 
 be growing in and we will do a bit of bushwhacking. This site is one of the
  significant natural heritage sites recorded on Corps of Engineers land at 
 Falls Lake. The shrub layer consists of spicebush\, pawpaw\, and painted bu
 ckeye\, which will be in various stages of flowering. The forest also boast

SUMMARY:AI for Agents Workshop
DESCRIPTION:All Things AI (Live)\n**Every AI agent is a delegation decisio
 n. This workshop teaches you how to make those decisions well.**\n\n[To pu
 rchase tickets\, visit [https://2026.allthingsai.org/register](https://202
 6.allthingsai.org/register) workshop tickets also include access to the Al
 l Things AI conference on March 24th. ***Price increases after Tuesday\, M
 arch 17 so sign-up early and save $100*** ]\n\nMany organizations have exp
 erimented with AI Agents. Far fewer have moved confidently into sustained\
 , responsible execution.\nAs teams progress from early pilots to real-worl
 d deployment\, leaders often encounter the same challenges: impressive pro
 totypes that stall before production\, uncertainty about where agents actu
 ally add value\, late-breaking security and governance concerns\, and misa
 lignment between business and technical stakeholders about what “success
 ” should look like. Too often\, these issues surface only after cost\, c
 omplexity\, or risk have already compounded.\nThis workshop helps leaders 
 make the shift from experimentation to execution—not by pushing agents e
 verywhere\, but by providing a clear blueprint for **when agents make sens
 e\, when they don’t\, and how to make sound decisions when autonomy is o
 n the table**.\n\n***\n\n#### **The Outcome: Better Decisions\, Earlier**\
 n\nBy the end of this session\, participants will have more than an overvi
 ew of AI Agents. They will leave with a **practical decision-making framew
 ork** they can apply immediately to real initiatives.\nYou’ll be able to
 :\n\n* determine whether an agent is appropriate for a given problem—or 
 whether a copilot or traditional automation is the better choice\n* evalua
 te agent proposals with a clear understanding of autonomy\, risk\, and tra
 deoffs\n* anticipate the organizational\, architectural\, and governance f
 actors that separate successful deployments from stalled experiments\n* id
 entify common failure modes early—while they are still inexpensive to ad
 dress\n\nThe result is clearer judgment about **what to delegate to agents
 \, what to constrain\, and what should remain human**.\n\n***\n\n#### **Wh
 at the Blueprint Covers**\n\nIn this intensive workshop\, business and tec
 hnical leaders will work through a practical blueprint for AI Agent succes
 s\, grounded in real-world constraints and leadership realities.\nKey topi
 cs include:\n\n* understanding degrees of agency and how they change cost\
 , risk\, and accountability\n* distinguishing agents from copilots and tra
 ditional automation—and why that distinction matters\n* identifying use 
 cases where agents consistently create value\, and scenarios where they in
 troduce unnecessary fragility\n* recognizing common pitfalls that derail a
 gent initiatives\, from over-delegation to hidden operational complexity\n
 * aligning organizational readiness\, security\, and governance with the l
 evel of autonomy being introduced\n\nParticipants will also receive a high
 -level technical orientation to the AI Agent ecosystem\, including platfor
 ms\, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\, and model selection tradeoffs. This in
 cludes a balanced discussion of the benefits and risks of using Small Lang
 uage Models (SLMs) in agentic workflows\, particularly when autonomy and t
 ool access are involved.\n\n***\n\n#### **What You’ll Leave With**\n\nPa
 rticipants will leave with:\n\n* A clear framework for deciding **if and w
 hen** AI Agents should be used\n* A practical blueprint outlining the cond
 itions required for agent success—and the signals that indicate trouble\
 n* A realistic understanding of the cost\, complexity\, and operational de
 mands of agent-based systems\n* Clear guidance for incorporating security\
 , governance\, and human oversight from the start\n* A shared language tha
 t aligns business and technical leaders around the same decision criteria\
 n\n***\n\n#### **Who This Is For**\n\nThis workshop is designed for busine
 ss and technical leaders responsible for turning AI experimentation into o
 perational reality\, including:\n\n* Leaders driving digital\, AI\, or tra
 nsformation initiatives (e.g.\, Chief Digital Officers\, Heads of AI\, Tra
 nsformation and Digital Strategy leaders)\n* Technology and architecture l
 eaders accountable for execution and scale (e.g.\, CTOs\, CIOs\, VPs of En
 gineering\, Enterprise and Solution Architects)\n* Product and innovation 
 leaders shaping AI-enabled capabilities (e.g.\, CPOs\, Heads of Product\, 
 Innovation and Emerging Technology leaders)\n* Security\, risk\, and gover
 nance leaders involved in overseeing autonomous or AI-driven systems (e.g.
 \, CISOs\, Responsible AI and Risk leaders)\n\nThis session is especially 
 valuable for leaders who sit at the intersection of strategy and execution
 —those expected to decide **when AI Agents should be used\, how much aut
 hority they should have\, and how to govern them responsibly**.\n\n[To pur
 chase tickets\, visit [https://2026.allthingsai.org/register](https://2026

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

  the video essay format as a legitimate mode of academic publishing. Since 
 then\, her videos have been viewed over 9 million times. YouTube is accessi
 ble and customizable\, offering a way to engage directly with a nonacademic
  audience. However\, it is also isolating\, biased toward particular kinds 
 of engagement\; it is also deeply politically fraught. In this talk\, Colín
  will share what she’s discovered about social media’s academic use — its s

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:*IN-PERSON* SF/F Group
DESCRIPTION:Durham Writers Group\nWe will be at the People's Solidarity Hu
 b at 1809 Chapel Hill Rd\, Durham. This venue does not serve food or drink
 \, but feel free to bring your own. There is a kitchenette for our use\, b
 ut be sure to clean up afterwards. The space might be a little cozy\; plea
 se consider masking or staying home if you have a respiratory ailment.\n\n
 This sub-group focuses on Speculative Fiction\, including Science Fiction\
 , Fantasy and Horror. If you have anything that falls under that category 
 — be it short story\, poem\, novel-in-progress or screenplay — then co
 me! We'd love to hear from you.\n\nOur format allows each reader 15 minute
 s to present their work aloud\, followed by approximately 20 minutes of fe
 edback from the other attendees. To ensure fairness\, each attendee is lim
 ited to 1 minute of Initial Feedback time. During that period\, the author
  remains silent. Next\, we have a 5 minute Free-For-All discussion about t
 he work -- then the author may speak. (We usually get through three reader
 s.)\n\nThough not required\, in order to receive more in-depth feed-back\,
  readers may post their work in advance on our Google Group:\nhttps://grou
 ps.google.com/d/forum/durham-sff-writers-group\n\nWe ask that participants
  keep their comments constructive and respectful\, focusing on what works 
 or doesn't work in the piece.\n\nWe also ask that readers provide a warnin
 g\, both on the Google Group and during the meeting\, if their story featu
 res content that some readers might find upsetting. This includes descript
 ions of violence or sexual content.\n\nReaders are:\n•\n•\n•\n\nBack
 up Readers are:\n•\n•\n•\n\nDeep Backup:\n•\n\n***\n\n***We meet e
 very Tuesday at the same time\, but alternate between In-Person*** ***and 
 on Zoom. Members may attend both formats\, if desired\, but readers will b
 e listed separately under the In-Person or Zoom weeks.***\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Writers Group

SUMMARY:Travel CHINA like a local! Virtual QnA [x-posted]
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh & Triangle Activities Meetup Group\nPutting out feeler
 s for curious\, cooperative 'comrades' to explore quiet corners of Old Cat
 hay! Trip date TBD - waiting for airfares to come down.\n\nThis will happe
 n on Google Meet.\n\n**CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR MEETING LINK!**\n\n[Comment 
 if you are able to log onto the link but don't see me - in the past Google
  has let two meetings with the same link open\, each person thinking the o
 ther didn't show up. So comment here and we'll see if we can fix it. :-) ]
 \n\nI've been traveling to China for 27 years. Join me for a unique\, off 
 the beaten track culture immersion adventure!\n\nComfort NOT guaranteed! L
 OTS of walking! This trip is NOT for everyone but everyone who has come wi
 th me so far has LOVED it!\n\nItinerary NOT guaranteed so as to maximize e
 xperience! Spontaneous private zheng concert in a riverside pavilion? Let'
 s stop and enjoy! Weather is forecast to be rain in the mountains? Let's g
 o to the ancient village instead.\n\nCosts currently unknown but should be
  under $100/day for ALL in-country necessities: food\, lodging\, entrance 
 fees\, ground transport. Whatever price I end up quoting will NOT include 
 transport to/from China\, alcohol\, upgrades to lodging\\*\, upgrades to i
 n-country transport\\*.\n\nYou can do it cheaper with a big box tour. If s
 trict time schedules\, overpriced shopping\, industrial restaurant food\, 
 and being kept away from locals is good enough for you than that's your be
 st bet. If unique\, real China\, great food\, insider knowledge with eye f
 or western comforts\\*\\*\, and turn on a dime\\*\\*\\* [a mao?] escapades
  are for you than come with me!\n\nOnly seven people! Small and 'nimble'\\
 *\\*\\*!\n\nHave you already been to China? Already have seen the Forbidde
 n City and Great Wall? No worries! Big box tours do NOT go where I go!\n\n
 Have you never been to China and NEED to see the big sights? No problem! I
  can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall\, Forbidden City\,
  Temple of Heaven\, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hi
 dden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded pe
 ople so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers 
 with shop-hating history buffs\, or long distance hikers with casual strol
 lers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO t
 rips\, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/den
 y as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe
  next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to g
 et a hint of what one might see. No guarantees of ANYTHING! China changes 
 very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the
  beaten track. I said 'adventure'!\n\n\\*\\*Sometimes western comforts are
  just not there. Deep in the countryside villages rarely have western toil
 ets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Quick change of plans is relative in China\; western expe
 ctations are best set aside and an embrace the new/unknown/surprise attitu
 de is highly recommended. But that's what a cultural adventure is all abou
 t!\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh & Triangle Activities

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: "Crooklyn" (Spike Lee\, 1994)
DESCRIPTION:Set in 1970s Brooklyn\, Crooklyn recounts childhood from the perspective of nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris)\, whose coming of age unfolds within the rhythms of Black family life\, neighborhood culture\, and social constraint. The film balances warmth and humor with moments of rupture\, revealing how maturity often arrives through confrontation with authority\, injustice\, and grief. Lee presents growing up as both deeply personal and inseparable from place\, race\, and community—an education shaped as much by environment as by experience. \n  \nThe film will be introduced by Daelena Tinnin-Gadson\, Assistant Professor of Black Film Studies and African American Literature. \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at the Varsity Theatre (123 East Franklin Street\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514). Tickets are free\, but must be reserved on the Ackland’s webpage. Register below. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nSource: Ackland Art Museum

 nAfter losing her parents in a car accident\, Okko goes to live in the coun

 s some spirits live there that only she can see — not scary ones but welcom
 ing ghosts who keep her company\, play games and help her navigate her new

 s ability to be a gracious host. But ultimately\, Okko discovers that dedic

DESCRIPTION:Religious studies professor Hugo Méndez (FFP ’22) will give a l
 ecture titled “Writing a New History of the Biblical Books of John\,” based
  on his recent research. Register for the event here. (This was previously 
 scheduled for Jan. 30.)\n\nThe Christian Bible contains four texts attribut
 ed to a disciple of Jesus named “John”: the Gospel of John and the letters 
 of 1 John\, 2 John\, and 3 John. But what do we know about the origins of t
 hese texts? Who really wrote them? In this lecture\, Méndez argues that the
 se works are a chain of falsely authored works (pseudepigrapha)\, written b
 y multiple pens over several decades. The author of the Gospel invented a d
 isciple of Jesus to serve as the narrator of his text\; the authors of the 
 letters\, in turn\, co-opted this character\, fleshing out so many afterliv
 es for him. This presentation traces this arc\, showing how a single act of
  disguised authorship inspired a new literary tradition and shaped twenty c
 enturies of Christian culture.\n\nHugo Méndez is an Associate Professor of 
 Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\, wher
 e he teaches New Testament and early Christianity. He is the author or co-a
 uthor of four books\, including two written as a Borden Faculty Fellow at t
 he IAH: The Gospel of John: A New History (Oxford\, 2025) and The Epistles 
 of John: Origins\, Authorship\, Purpose (Cambridge\, forthcoming). He is al
 so a frequent contributor to documentaries for History and other media outl
 ets.\n\n \n\nLearn more about the event at the IAH website. See all events 
 in the IAH Fellows Forum series.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

  than awareness—usable knowledge.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1️⃣ **Rea
 l Product Experience:** See full workflows in motion—not just the highli
 ghts.\n\n2️⃣ **Usability in Focus:** Evaluate ease of use\, integratio
 n paths\, and how quickly value is delivered.\n\n3️⃣ **Interactive Lea

SUMMARY:April 2 - AI\, ML and Computer Vision Meetup
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nJoin
  our virtual Meetup to hear talks from experts on cutting-edge topics acro
 ss AI\, ML\, and computer vision.\n\n**Date\, Time and Location**\n\nApr 2
 \, 2026\n9 - 11 AM Pacific\nOnline. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://vox
 el51.com/events/ai-ml-and-computer-vision-meetup-april-2-2026)**\n\n**Asyn
 c Agents in Production: Failure Modes and Fixes**\n\nAs models improve\, w
 e are starting to build long-running\, asynchronous agents such as deep re
 search agents and browser agents that can execute multi-step workflows aut
 onomously. These systems unlock new use cases\, but they fail in ways that
  short-lived agents do not.\n\nThe longer an agent runs\, the more early m
 istakes compound\, and the more token usage grows through extended reasoni
 ng\, retries\, and tool calls. Patterns that work for request-response age
 nts often break down\, leading to unreliable behaviour and unpredictable c
 osts.\n\nThis talk is aimed at use case developers\, with secondary releva
 nce for platform engineers. It covers the most common failure modes in asy
 nc agents and practical design patterns for reducing error compounding and
  keeping token costs bounded in production.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Mer
 yem Arik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meryemarik/) is the co-founder and C
 EO of Doubleword\, where she works on large-scale LLM inference and produc
 tion AI systems. She studied theoretical physics and philosophy at the Uni
 versity of Oxford. Meryem is a frequent conference speaker\, including a T
 EDx speaker and a four-time highly rated speaker at QCon conferences. She 
 was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for her work in AI infrastructure
 .\n\n**Visual AI at the Edge: Beyond the Model**\n\nEdge-based visual AI p
 romises low latency\, privacy\, and real-time decision-making\, but many p
 rojects struggle to move beyond successful demos. This talk explores what 
 deploying visual AI at the edge really involves\, shifting the focus from 
 models to complete\, operational systems. We will discuss common pitfalls 
 teams encounter when moving from lab to field. Attendees will leave with a
  practical mental model for approaching edge vision projects more effectiv
 ely.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[David Moser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d
 avid-moser-dm/) is an AI/Computer Vision expert and Founding Engineer with
  a strong track record of building and deploying safety-critical visual AI
  systems in real-world environments. As Co-Founder of Orella Vision\, he i
 s building Visual AI for Autonomy on the Edge - going from data and models
  to production-grade edge deployments.\n\n**Sanitizing Evaluation Datasets
 : From Detection to Correction**\n\nWe generally accept that gold standard
  evaluation sets contain label noise\, yet we rarely fix them because the 
 engineering friction is too high. This talk presents a workflow to operati
 onalize ground-truth auditing. We will demonstrate how to bridge the gap b
 etween algorithmic error detection and manual rectification. Specifically\
 , we will show how to inspect discordant ground truth labels and correct t
 hem directly in-situ. The goal is to move to a fully trusted end-to-end ev
 aluation pipeline.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Nick Lotz](https://www.linke
 din.com/in/nicholaslotz) is an engineer on the Voxel51 community team. Wit
 h a background in open source infrastructure and a passion for developer e
 nablement\, Nick focuses on helping teams understand their tools and how t
 o use them to ship faster.\n\n**Building enterprise agentic systems that s
 cale**\n\nBuilding AI agents that work in demos is easy\, building true as
 sistants that make people genuinely productive takes a different set of pa
 tterns. This talk shares lessons from a multi-agent system at Cisco used b
 y 2\,000+ sellers daily\, where we moved past "chat with your data" to enc
 oding business workflows into true agentic systems people actually rely on
  to get work done.\n\nWe'll cover multi-agent orchestration patterns for c
 omplex workflows\, the personalization and productivity features that driv
 e adoption\, and the enterprise foundations that helped us earn user trust
  at scale. You'll leave with an architecture and set of patterns that have
  been battle tested at enterprise scale.\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Aman S
 ardana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amansardana/) is a Senior Engineering 
 Architect at Cisco\, I lead the design and deployment of enterprise AI sys
 tems that blend LLMs\, data infrastructure\, and customer experience to so
 lve high‑stakes\, real-world problems at scale. I’m also an open-sourc
 e contributor and active mentor in the AI community\, helping teams move f
 rom AI experimentation to reliable agentic applications in production.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

  leading\, and why that matters for your team’s growth and resilience. Most
  importantly\, you will leave with a simple\, practical tool to help you sl

SUMMARY:Botany by Plant Family: The Key to See
DESCRIPTION:Learning to notice plant family patterns can greatly aid in demystifying the “green wall” of plant species around us. Nearly 350\,000 species of flowering plants are known to global science\, and these species have been grouped into more than 400 flowering plant families. By learning the top 30 plant families growing around you\, you will begin to recognize plants everywhere you go. After an indoor presentation on the major plant families common to the Southeastern U.S.\, ethnobotanist marc williams will reinforce your plant identification skills on a walk in the Gardens to observe family patterns in leaf\, flower and fruit types. Discuss edibility\, medicinality\, craft\, wildlife support and landscape beauty as you gain a more holistic understanding of the major plants comprising Southern U.S. flora and their potential ecological and ethnobotanical applications. \nFee: $32; 20% discount for Duke Gardens members with discount code. \nParking: Fees apply. \nLocation: Onsite at Duke Gardens. Meeting location will be included in a program reminder email sent before the program. \nAccessibility: This will be a small group program that takes place partially seated indoors and partially outdoors traveling on a combination of paved and unpaved paths with some uneven surfaces and moderate inclines.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

 \, but feel free to bring your own. There is a kitchenette for our use\, b
 ut be sure to clean up afterwards. The space might be a little cozy\; plea
 se consider masking or staying home if you have a respiratory ailment.\n\n
 This sub-group focuses on Speculative Fiction\, including Science Fiction\
 , Fantasy and Horror. If you have anything that falls under that category

 me! We'd love to hear from you.\n\nOur format allows each reader 15 minute
 s to present their work aloud\, followed by approximately 20 minutes of fe
 edback from the other attendees. To ensure fairness\, each attendee is lim
 ited to 1 minute of Initial Feedback time. During that period\, the author
  remains silent. Next\, we have a 5 minute Free-For-All discussion about t
 he work -- then the author may speak. (We usually get through three reader
 s.)\n\nThough not required\, in order to receive more in-depth feed-back\,
  readers may post their work in advance on our Google Group:\nhttps://grou
 ps.google.com/d/forum/durham-sff-writers-group\n\nWe ask that participants
  keep their comments constructive and respectful\, focusing on what works 
 or doesn't work in the piece.\n\nWe also ask that readers provide a warnin

SUMMARY:April 8 - Getting Started with FiftyOne
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nThis
  workshop provides a technical foundation for managing large scale compute
 r vision datasets. You will learn to curate\, visualize\, and evaluate mod
 els using the [open source FiftyOne app](https://docs.voxel51.com/).\n\n**
 Date\, Time and Location**\n\nApr 8\, 2026\n10 AM PST - 11 AM Pacific\nOnl
 ine. **[Register for the Zoom!](https://voxel51.com/events/getting-started
 -with-fiftyone-april-8-2026)**\n\nThe session covers data ingestion\, embe
 dding visualization\, and model failure analysis. You will build workflows
  to identify dataset bias\, find annotation errors\, and select informativ
 e samples for training. Attendees leave with a framework for data centric 
 AI for research and production pipelines\, prioritizing data quality over 
 pure model iteration.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\n* **Structure unstructured d
 ata.** Map data and metadata into a queryable schema for images\, videos\,
  and point clouds.\n* **Query datasets with the FiftyOne SDK**. Create com
 plex views based on model predictions\, labels\, and custom tags. Use the 
 FiftyOne to filter data based on logical conditions and confidence scores.
 \n* **Visualize high dimensional embeddings**. Project features into lower
  dimensions to find clusters of similar samples. Identify data gaps and ou
 tliers using FiftyOne Brain.\n* **Automate data curation.** Implement algo
 rithmic measures to select diverse subsets for training. Reduce labeling c
 osts by prioritizing high entropy samples.\n* **Debug model performance.**
  Run evaluation routines to generate confusion matrices and precision reca
 ll curves. Visualize false positives and false negatives directly in the A
 pp to understand model failures.\n* **Customize FiftyOne**. Build custom d
 ashboards and interactive panels. Create specialized views for domain spec
 ific tasks.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Working knowledge of Python and mac
 hine learning and/or computer vision fundamentals.\n* All attendees will g
 et access to the tutorials and code examples used in the workshop.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

  behaviors\, and ourselves. Now is the time to thrive by learning how to be
  adaptive and to be consistently able to change yourself to accommodate and
  maximize the benefits of change.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nBy the end o
 f this workshop\, you will:\n• Differentiate between being adaptive and sim

DESCRIPTION:Research is relying on increasingly complex code. However\, mos
 t academics have not received formal training in software development. This
  course will introduce participants to some of the best practices of profes
 sional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Pyt
 hon code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scri
 pts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for t
 heir functions\, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure
  that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\
 nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record
  package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities an
 d ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the orig
 inal analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control syst
 em. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Git
 hub\, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests ar
 e run each time code is changed.\n\nThe course will primarily consist of a 
 hands-on exercise to restructure a single long analysis file into functions
  and automated tests.\n\n“Version Control with Git and Github” course is a 
 prerequisite for this course.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stude
 nts) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:April 9 - Workshop: Build a Visual Agent that can Navigate GUIs li
 ke Humans
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh AI\, Machine Learning and Computer Vision Meetup\nThis
  hands-on workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to building and e
 valuating visual agents for GUI automation using modern tools and techniqu
 es.\n\n**Date\, Time and Location**\n\nApril 9\, 2026 at 9 AM Pacific\nOnl
 ine. **[Register for the Zoom](https://voxel51.com/events/visual-agents-wh
 at-it-takes-to-build-an-agent-that-can-navigate-guis-like-humans-april-9-2
 026)**\n\nVisual agents that can understand and interact with graphical us
 er interfaces represent a transformative frontier in AI automation. These 
 systems combine computer vision\, natural language understanding\, and spa
 tial reasoning to enable machines to navigate complex interfaces—from we
 b applications to desktop software—just as humans do. However\, building
  robust GUI agents requires careful attention to dataset curation\, model 
 evaluation\, and iterative improvement workflows.\n\nParticipants will lea
 rn how to leverage [FiftyOne](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone)\, an op
 en-source toolkit for dataset curation and computer vision workflows\, to 
 build production-ready GUI agent systems.\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\n\n* **Dat
 aset Creation & Management:** How to structure\, annotate\, and load GUI i
 nteraction datasets using the COCO4GUI standardized format\n* **Data Explo
 ration & Analysis:** Using FiftyOne's interactive interface to visualize d
 atasets\, analyze action distributions\, and understand annotation pattern
 s\n* **Multimodal Embeddings:** Computing embeddings for screenshots and U
 I element patches to enable similarity search and retrieval\n* **Model Inf
 erence:** Running state-of-the-art models like Microsoft's GUI-Actor to pr
 edict interaction points from natural language instructions\n* **Performan
 ce Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy using standard metrics and norma
 lized click distance to assess localization precision\n* **Failure Analysi
 s:** Investigating model failures through attention maps\, error pattern a
 nalysis\, and systematic debugging workflows\n* **Data-Driven Improvement:
 ** Tagging samples based on error types (attention misalignment vs. locali
 zation errors) to prioritize fine-tuning efforts\n* **Synthetic Data Gener
 ation:** Using FiftyOne plugins to augment training data with synthetic ta
 sk descriptions and variations\n\n*About the Speaker*\n\n[Harpreet Sahota]
 (https://www.linkedin.com/in/harpreetsahota204/) is a hacker-in-residence 
 and machine learning engineer with a passion for deep learning and generat
 ive AI. He’s got a deep interest in RAG\, Agents\, and Multimodal AI.\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh AI, ML & Computer Vision

DESCRIPTION:Research is relying on increasingly complex code. However\, mos
 t academics have not received formal training in software development. This
  course will introduce participants to some of the best practices of profes
 sional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Pyt
 hon code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scri
 pts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for t
 heir functions\, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure
  that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\
 nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record
  package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities an
 d ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the orig
 inal analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control syst
 em. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Git
 hub\, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests ar
 e run each time code is changed.\n\nThe course will primarily consist of a 
 hands-on exercise to restructure a single long analysis file into functions
  and automated tests.\n\n“Version Control with Git and Github” course is a 
 prerequisite for this course.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stude
 nts) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Join Belle Boggs\, professor in the Department of English at NC
  State\, and Sylvester Allen Jr. as they discuss their new book\, The Legen
 d of Wyatt Outlaw: From Reconstruction Through Black Lives Matter. Outlaw’s
  story was one of Black success — he was a Union League leader\, business o
 wner and the first Black town constable and commissioner in Graham\, a smal
 l town in North Carolina’s Alamance County. But in 1870\, the Ku Klux Klan 
 murdered Outlaw\, setting off a dramatic series of events. Allen and Boggs 
 both sought to discover why Outlaw had been erased from mainstream history 
 books. In The Legend of Wyatt Outlaw\, they share what they found in artful
  detail and connect Outlaw’s story to the violence against Black people in 
 Alamance and throughout the United States\, from Reconstruction through Jim
  Crow\, the civil rights era and Black Lives Matter.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Ever pondered whether to include a variable in an analysis – is
  the variable necessary\, will its inclusion/exclusion introduce bias in th
 e analysis?  Why is the variable important anyways – is it a mediator\, a m
 oderator and a confounder some combination of these???\n\nThis course intro
 duces how to incorporate DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in analysis plannin
 g to help think through what variables to collect and use (or refrain from 
 using) in an analysis.\n\nTopics include:\n\nIntroducing the structure of D
 AGs and the rules for using them to guide variable selectionA deep dive int
 o the types of variable relations captured in DAGs with emphasis on mediati
 on\, moderation\, effect modification\, confounding and colliders and their
  potential to introduce bias in analysisHands on example of how to create a
 nd evaluate DAGs in R using the package daggityUse of DAGs may help inform 
 data collection and analytical plans in ways that enhance reproducibility.\

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

  remains silent. Next\, we have a 5 minute Free-For-All discussion about t
 he work -- then the author may speak. (We usually get through three reader
 s.)\n\nThough not required\, in order to receive more in-depth feed-back\,
  readers may post their work in advance on our Google Group:\nhttps://grou
 ps.google.com/d/forum/durham-sff-writers-group\n\nWe ask that participants
  keep their comments constructive and respectful\, focusing on what works 
 or doesn't work in the piece.\n\nWe also ask that readers provide a warnin

 County Historical Society at the Daniel Davenport Festival have come togeth
 er to commemorate the lives of Revolutionary War Soldiers.\n\nThere will be
  living history demonstrations\, including ropemaking\, examples of soldier

 s will provide musical performances. Other presentations include medicine d
 uring the American Revolution\, and the Tyrrell County Men who served in th

 ch illustrate 18th-century life\, including a corn crib\, smokehouse\, and 
 a building for the loom\, have been arranged. The Homestead is on the Natio

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:The problem with most attempts to adopt stress-management or se
 lf-care routines is that they require time\, effort and planning. The reali
 ty for many people who have stressful jobs is that they are too physically 
 exhausted and mentally depleted by the end of the day to initiate activitie
 s commonly recommended to reduce stress in their lives. The trick is to int
 ervene via multiple “micro-moments” of relaxation or mindful practices whic
 h only take 15 to 60 seconds. These moments of relaxation help bring stress
  levels down during the workday and interrupt the steady escalation of stre
 ss that creates physical and mental exhaustion. Also addressed: simple wind
 ing-down routines that can end the day in a calming\, mindful way.\n\n \n\n
 Workshop Objectives\nThis training will help you:\n• Describe how stress es

DESCRIPTION:Take a glance through recent news or social media and you would
  be hard-pressed not to see mentions of chatbots and artificial intelligenc
 e (AI) methods aimed at generating text\, images and other content.  Recent
  work by Eloundou and colleagues (2023) explored the potential impact of th
 ese types of generative AI on labor markets\, and survey research\, specifi
 cally was among the top two most impacted industries.  Professor Andrew Ng 
 has been cited as saying “AI won’t replace human workers\, but ‘people that
  use it will replace people that don’t.’”  Much of the way researchers in t
 he social sciences and survey research are incorporating AI into their work
 flow involves some type of prompting.  Prompt Engineering approaches along 
 with more nuanced fine tuning approaches are being used and refined to bett
 er incorporate more robust approaches for AI incorporation into the researc
 h process.  In this shortcourse we will provide an overview of the emerging
  field of prompt engineering and illustrate how a prompt engineering approa
 ch and problem specification mindset can be useful for maximizing the utili
 ty of large language models\, specifically\, within social science.  Concep
 ts and experimental approaches will be illustrated using several real-world
 \, grounded and published work.  The shortcourse also incorporates an exper
 iential component that encourages participants to apply basic concepts that
  we cover in the course in real-time as we work on exercises together in th
 e later part of the course. Registration and fee (refundable for students) 
 are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Managing individuals who may be struggling with stress\, anxiet
 y\, depression and other mental health concerns can be a difficult balancin
 g act. Your role is to manage performance and to bring out the best in your
  workforce\, but accomplishing this often requires you to express concern a
 nd support when employees struggle emotionally. Managers often feel uncomfo
 rtable in this aspect of their role and may lack the important skills of “e
 motional management.” This course covers ways employees may present their d
 istress and offers insights and strategies on forging supportive empathic a
 lliances within the role of manager. The session also identifies common mis
 takes managers make in responding to employees in distress and explains com
 munication skills that express support and convey positive expectancy. Part
 icipants are also given information on how to refer employees to the Employ
 ee Assistance Program.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nBy the end of this work
 shop\, you will:\n• Understand the universality of mental health issues in 
 the workplace\n• Recognize the most common symptoms of mental illness\n• Id
 entify the most common unhelpful reactions to symptoms\, why they occur and
  how to avoid them\n• Identify ways of expressing compassion and developing
  an alliance with distressed employees\n• Reduce the stigma associated ment
 al illness and promote ways of supporting one another in the workplace\n• R
 ecognize the warning signs of suicide\n• Identify support services and reso
 urces for all leaders and employees\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent regist
 ration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:The Context Layer: The Emerging Stack for Context-Aware AI
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nAs enterprises push AI into production\,
  context isn’t a luxury—it’s a requirement. Whether you're mitigatin
 g hallucinations\, aligning responses with brand and policy guidelines\, o
 r ensuring traceable\, compliant outcomes\, context-aware architecture is 
 becoming foundational to trustworthy AI.\n\nThis webinar explores the “c
 ontext layer”—the emerging stack of tools\, techniques\, and workflows
  that inject dynamic\, domain-specific intelligence into AI systems. We’
 ll examine how leading teams are designing for retrieval-augmented generat
 ion (RAG)\, grounding\, memory\, and orchestration to ensure outputs refle
 ct the right data\, tone\, and constraints at the right time.\n\n**What Yo
 u'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Architecting the Context Layer:** What the emer
 ging stack looks like—from vector databases and memory systems to orches
 tration layers and policy enforcement.\n\n2️⃣ **Reducing Hallucination
 s:** How context-aware design helps constrain generative outputs to known\
 , verifiable sources.\n\n3️⃣ **Boosting Trust & Alignment:** Technique
 s for integrating domain-specific knowledge\, tone\, and compliance rules 
 directly into AI interactions.\n\n4️⃣ **From Static to Dynamic Context
 :** When to use retrieval\, when to use memory\, and how to balance both f
 or adaptive\, scalable systems.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042c

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

SUMMARY:Native Plant Solutions: Fall Forward Perennials
DESCRIPTION:Does your landscape look tired near the end of summer? Give yourself and the wildlife around you a boost with fall-forward perennials. At their peak during late summer and fall\, these species have unique charms and an important ecological role. They give pollinators the resources they need before transitioning to the next stage of development. The superstars of autumn\, asters and goldenrods\, are keystone species that lend outsized support to food webs. They and other fall-forward plants extend the season visually and offer a rich tapestry of color and radiance optimized for the changing angle of the sun. Join Shannon Currey\, education and outreach at Izel Native Plants\, to learn more about lighting up your landscape with fall in mind! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

DESCRIPTION:For a long time\, the scientific community believed we were bor
 n with a certain number of brain cells and neural pathways and that\, once 
 damaged\, they could not be repaired. In reality\, our brains are much more
  flexible. Depending on our lifestyle\, we can weaken or destroy connection
 s\, or create new\, stronger ones. Engaging regularly in certain behaviors 
 and activities\, like physical exercise\, addressing mental health issues\,
  meditation\, and learning a new language or musical instrument\, support n
 ew wiring and can make existing pathways stronger. Essentially\, we can slo
 w down or somewhat prevent cognitive decline by doing challenging mental ex
 ercises to keep our brains fit for optimal power.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectiv
 es\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be able to:\nIdentify traits of 
 a healthy brain:\n• The ability to learn new skills\n• Judgment and intuiti
 on\n• Memory and perception\nIdentify barriers to good brain health:\n• Dep
 ression\n• Chronic stress\n• Unhealthy lifestyle\nIdentify methods for opti
 mal cognitive health:\n• Engaging in new skills and mentally challenging ac
 tivities\n• Meditation\n• Physical exercise\n• Brain training\n\n \n\nClick

DESCRIPTION:Your body responds to the way you think\, feel and act. This is
  often called the “mind/body connection.” When you are stressed\, anxious o
 r upset\, your body tries to tell you that something isn’t right. For examp
 le\, high blood pressure might develop after a particularly stressful event
 \, such as the death of a loved one. People with good emotional health are 
 aware of their thoughts\, feelings and behaviors. They have learned healthy
  ways to cope with the stress and problems that are a normal part of life. 
 They feel good about themselves and have healthy relationships. Poor emotio
 nal health can weaken your body’s immune system\, making you more likely to
  get colds and other infections during emotionally difficult times. Also\, 
 when you are feeling stressed\, anxious or upset\, you may not take care of
  your health as well as you should. You may not feel like exercising\, eati
 ng nutritious foods or taking medicine that your doctor prescribes. Abuse o
 f alcohol\, tobacco or other drugs may also be a sign of poor emotional hea
 lth.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be
  able to:\nIdentify the relationship between mind and body\n• Describe how 
 the body influences emotional and mental functioning\n• Describe how our em
 otions\, beliefs and self talk impact our body\n• Identify symptoms of a po
 ssible mind/body disconnection\nIdentify ways to enhance the mind/body conn
 ection\n• Describe methods for achieving balance in life\n• Identify ways t
 o express feelings appropriately\n• Describe the importance of taking care 
 of your health\n• Describe ways to enhance awareness\nIdentify your persona
 l action plan for mind/body connection\n• Recognize the importance of consu
 lting with your physician\n• Describe which mind/body tools need to develop
 \n• List outside resources for further help\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talen

DESCRIPTION:Join us at The Park at Seven Devils for some backyard birding! 
 Birding is an activity that can be done by anyone at any age. Most birders 
 start out by identifying common birds found at their backyard bird feeders.
  During this workshop you will learn how to point out key characteristics\,
  such as size\, coloration\, and activity\, that can help you identify comm
 on backyard bird species\, specifically species that visit bird feeders. By
  using applications like Audubon and Merlin\, along with identification gui
 des\, you will be able to use those key characteristics to help you identif
 y common species found here in the High Country. Binoculars are not require
 d\, but highly recommended\, and there will be a quick lesson on how to pro
 perly use binoculars. This is a Ranger Workshop with The Town of Seven Devi
 ls.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:*Save the Date* More Details Coming Soon! The New Bern Resolves
  constitute a significant chapter in the history of the American Revolution
 \, reflecting the growing discontent of the colonies with British rule and 
 their bold steps toward self-governance. Adopted on August 27\, 1774\, by 7
 1 elected NC delegates to the First Provincial Congress in America\, the Ne
 w Bern Resolves represented an early\, decisive expression of resistance to
  British policies and "The Intolerable Acts" (Boston Port/Trade Act\, Massa
 chusetts Government Act\, Administration of Justice Act\, and Quartering Ac
 ts) by calling for economic sanctions against Great Britain and its trading
  partners. As one of the earliest documented calls for solidarity among the
  colonies\, the New Bern Resolves laid the groundwork for broader revolutio
 nary movements.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:Harriet Ann Daves recalled just how monumental Civil War surren
 ders were for her family: "When the surrender came my grandfather came to m
 y mother and told her: 'Well\, you are as free as I am.'"\n\nClaiming freed
 om was not so straightforward for the 331\,059 enslaved women\, children\, 
 and men during the Civil War. Some took enormous risk to reach Union lines 
 before the federal government made any promise of abolishing slavery. Other
 s left their homes and plantations to follow Sherman's army as they marched
  through the southeast. Some believed home was where they already lived and
  worked and waited patiently for freedom to extend to them. Others still we
 re lied to by their enslavers or moved away from the advancing U.S. Army so
  they would remain enslaved. Freedom came in different ways and at differen
 t times to enslaved people across the state.\n\nOne common thread unites th
 ese freedom stories: the defeat of the Confederate military ensured a new b
 irth of freedom across the state and nation.\n\nDuring this special luminar
 y program\, Bennett Place invites you to reflect on the end of the Civil Wa
 r as a momentous step towards freedom for all Americans and the end of chat
 tel slavery in the United States. Walk among 3\,310 luminaries - one for ev
 ery 1\,000 enslaved people in North Carolina - and reflect on experiences o
 f enslavement and freedom. Historians dot the path and share stories of peo
 ple's pathways to freedom and life after slavery & the Civil War.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

 the science behind dye production. Visitors will have a chance to view and 
 work an active fermentation vat\, and dyeing demonstrations will occur thro

 Deep Learning
DESCRIPTION:Triangle AI Meetup\nThis talk is an in-depth look at XMPP\, th
 e open standard for real-time messaging\, and how to build a global scale\
 , AI enhanced messaging system using XMPP. We’ll explore EJabberD\, the 
 massively scalable\, open-source XMPP server that powers in-game chat for 
 Eve Online\, and examine how to: combine XMPP with WebRTC for real-time au
 dio/video calling\, add AIML to build helpful chatbots\, and how to incorp
 orate Deep Learning to categorize messages in real-time. After the talk\, 
 you’ll know how to use XMPP and Ejabberd to build anything from a help-d
 esk chatops application\, to a globe spanning in-game messaging system.\n\nSource: Meetup: Triangle AI
