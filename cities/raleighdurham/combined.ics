SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Removal (Marvin)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Habitat Builders Chapter at Marvin Efird Park to remove some invasive species. We will show you how to identify various species and how to remove them from the landscape. \n\nInvasive plants are non-native introduced plants that do not support native wildlife. They are very aggressive\, outcompete wildlife-friendly plants\, and take over natural areas. Nandina\, Privet\, Monkey Grass\, and Autumn/Russian olive are common invasive plants that have escaped residential landscapes and are taking over natural areas. To make matters worse\, these plants are still available for sale in big box stores. \n\nWe will have some tools available\, but you are encouraged to bring a pair of loppers\, pruners\, pruning saw\, or shovel. NO POWER TOOLS PLEASE. \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

DESCRIPTION:The Johri lab is interested in better characterizing the shape
  of the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in organisms and
  on understanding how selection on functionally important regions affects
  genome-wide patterns of variation. Population genomic inference currentl
 y does not account for the effects of selection across the genome\, which
  is especially problematic in species with compact genomes (i.e.\, those 
 with a high density of protein-coding and regulatory regions) where natur
 al selection is pervasive. We develop statistical and computational metho
 ds that simultaneously account for the effects of selection jointly with 
 other evolutionary processes to make accurate evolutionary inferences (su
 ch as historical changes in population size) using sequence variation fro
 m natural populations. As most pathogenic species tend to have highly com
 pact genomes and experience strong bouts of selection and drastic repeate
 d bottlenecks\, our methodological advances and recent theoretical effort
 s will be important to uncovering their population and selective history.\n\nSource: Duke University

 MoonDog\, some are brought by attendees)\, a fun and welcoming group of fo
 lks (always eager to have more\, however!)\, and there are always folks ea

 has a growing collection of canned and bottled brews\, ciders\, and colas 
 in addition to their in-house-brewed meads. There are also some snacks lik
 e chips and popcorn. Sometimes\, folks bring in other treats to share. If 
 you do\, please mark them as containing any common allergens.\n\nOutside f
 ood (delivered\, brought in\, or homemade) is welcomed and encouraged. Out
 side drinks are not. Since the venue does not prepare food\, **dogs are al
 lowed and welcomed.** (Dogs are very friendly and welcoming\, too\, but th
 ey mostly roam around to collect ear scritches and love. If you're not com
 fortable with dogs around\, let us know\, and we'll try to accommodate.)\n
 \nBring games\, friends\, and a welcoming spirit. We're excited to have yo
 u with us!\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Geeks

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:The mechanical properties of biological tissues change over ti
 me and with disease progression. Quantifying these mechanical properties 
 can thus be instrumental for medical diagnosis and for evaluation of tiss
 ue viability for transplant. However\, it is exceptionally challenging to
  mechanically characterize soft and biological materials using convention
 al testing methods\, especially in-vivo. In recent years\, volume control
 led cavity expansion (VCCE) has emerged as a powerful needle-based method
  for quantifying the nonlinear properties of soft materials in-situ. In t
 his talk\, after briefly revisiting the fundamentals of VCCE\, I will des
 cribe the translation of VCCE into Digital Palpation (DP)\; a minimally i
 nvasive diagnostic tool offering a quantitative alternative to a clinicia
 n's sense of touch. I will describe the application of DP for testing in 
 human tissue and will focus on an ex-vivo study of 35 tests in freshly re
 sected human thyroid nodules. I will show how data from this rapid and mi
 nimally invasive mechanical test enables separation between benign and ma
 lignant nodules of this highly prevalent cancer and can even hint at reso
 lving oncocytic and follicular sub-types that routinely confound existing
  diagnosis methods. At present\, up to one third of thyroid nodules canno
 t be decisively classified\, leading to avoidable surgical removal of the
  thyroid gland. We hope that these results can\, in the future\, help to 
 reduce the large fraction of thyroidectomies (40-70%) that ultimately pro
 ve benign and thus avoidable\; potentially relieving patients from the po
 tential life-long implications of surgical complications and hormone repl
 acement\, and paving the way for the diagnosis of additional diseases.\n\nSource: Duke University

 our registration.</i>\n\nThe Duke Office of Scientific Integrity is partn
 ering with Trinity College to expand our offerings of interactive Respons
 ible Conduct of Research (RCR) trainings tailored for Duke researchers in
  the humanities\, arts\, and interpretative social sciences!\n\nWe've hea
 rd the feedback that the RCR training programs - which are required for a
 ll research-active Duke faculty and staff - have not been well-matched to
  research in the humanities. So\, we're working with Trinity leadership t
 o help make those programs more useful for our faculty\, and we want to e
 ngage the humanities research community in that process. As a first pilot
  step\, we will host RCR training events that will both <b>fulfill the 20
 0-level RCR requirement for attendees</b> and <b>help shape the future of
  RCR training in the humanities and related disciplines</b>. The initial 
 events will be limited to senior (e.g.\, associate\, full\, emeritus) fac
 ulty who work in any area of the humanities\, arts\, and/or interpretive 
 social sciences. We believe that your perspective can help us shape the d
 evelopment of more relevant and effective research training programs.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:QCD and effective field theory together put low energy nuclear
  physics on solid theoretical footing to calculate observables with some 
 confidence\, but open questions remain.  Two related questions are why QC
 D seems not to violate CP and how the properties of nuclear matter depend
  on the light quark masses (or equivalently the pion mass).  The classic 
 solution to the former problem is to invoke a new light field\, the QCD a
 xion\, a well-motivated dark matter candidate which a diverse experimenta
 l campaign is currently searching for.  Neutron stars can also probe the 
 QCD axion parameter space if nuclear matter becomes more attractive at re
 duced pion mass via the formation of an axion condensate.  Answering the 
 question of whether an axion with a mass at the QCD prediction could cond
 ense in neutron stars hinges on a number of fundamental questions in nucl
 ear physics\, including the properties of three nucleon forces\, the impo
 rtance of light resonances neglected in chiral EFT\, fine tuning in s-wav
 e scattering\, and at what density chiral symmetry restoration occurs in 
 cold nuclear matter.  In this talk\, I will present our current research 
 on pion mass dependence in chiral EFT\, possible observable signatures in
  neutron stars\, and what the study of pion mass dependence can teach us 
 about extant theoretical problems in low energy nuclear physics.\n\nSource: Duke University

DESCRIPTION:Work\, family and personal life responsibilities can feel overw
 helming\, and it sometimes seems as if a 24-hour day simply isn’t long enou
 gh to get everything done. Unfortunately\, no one has yet found a way to ad
 d a 25th hour to the day\, so we’re all forced to do the best with the time
  we have. By following the principles discussed in this workshop\, you may 
 still never get everything done\, but you should feel more in control of yo
 ur very busy life.\n\nSource: NC State University

 lowed by 10 minutes of body movement practice leading into a 20-minute circ
 uit of those learned movements\, known as an AMRAP (as many rounds/reps as 
 possible). We’ll end with a 10-minute cool down. This will be physically ch
 allenging\, but movements can be modified. Meet in the open lawn near the V
 isitor’s Center. Program is weather dependent.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:This interactive\, hands-on workshop will introduce participant
 s to a research design framework for considering the use of generative AI i
 n qualitative research designs and workflows (Paulus & Lester\, 2024).\nWe 
 will start by acknowledging inherent risks and ethical dilemmas posed by th
 e development of large language models and how generative AI is challenging
  the essence of what it means to do qualitative work (Paulus & Marone\, 202
 5\; Paulus\, Lester & Davis\, 2025). We will learn how to distinguish betwe
 en methodological strategies and technological tactics\, i.e. why researche
 rs must first know how they want to work with their data before choosing th
 e best tools to do so. We will then discuss the current ‘state of play’ reg
 arding the various genres of AI-assist technologies available to qualitativ
 e researchers and how to select the most appropriate platform. We will then
  design and implement an “AI-assisted workflow” for managing and analyzing 
 data using MAXQDA. Finally\, we will discuss best practices for how to repo
 rt the use of AI in research studies (Lester & Paulus\, forthcoming) and ho
 w to reflexively consider the consequences of doing so.\nSample interview d
 ata will be used for the practice exercises with discussion around the use 
 of other types of qualitative data. Workshop time will alternate between sh
 ort lectures and demonstrations\, small group discussions\, practical hands
 -on activities\, and application of principles learned to the participants’
  own research studies and data.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stu
 dents) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Science Café: Rhinos\, Red Pandas\, and Hell Pigs\, Oh My!
DESCRIPTION:a glimpse into North Carolina’s terrestrial ecosystems 20 million years ago\nMuseum paleontologist Sean Moran holds the cast of a single hell pig molar. \nJoin us in person or watch the livestream on YouTube. \nMuch of North Carolina’s fossil record over the last 100 million years is derived from marine environments\, often excluding fossils from terrestrial ecosystems. This talk will explore new fossils collected from Jones County and deposited in the early Miocene\, about 20 million years ago\, that are beginning to shed light on an unusual land mammal fauna from our state. \nSean Moran is the Collections Manager of Paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Though responsible for managing and growing the Museum’s Paleontology Research Collections\, from fossil crabs to dinosaurs\, ferns to sharks\, his research interests mostly relate to the evolution and ecology of terrestrial mammals over the last 34 million years. \nGrab a bite from the Daily Planet Café and join host Chris Smith for our monthly Science Café. Gather with other curious minds at this after-hours event for an informal presentation and conversation about current science topics with guest experts. The Daily Planet Café is open 5–8pm with a full menu during the Science Café.\n\nSource: NC Museum of Natural Sciences

DESCRIPTION:Trapped in a time loop\, space traveler Egon Tichy faces his ow
 n worst enemy: himself. And he’s multiplying. In this inventive fusion of l
 ive performance and digital video sleight-of-hand\, a single actor builds a
  cinematic sci-fi comedy in real time\, transforming an 8x4 white box into 
 a cosmic wonderland.\n\nThe acclaimed physical theater company Sinking Ship
  Productions and the Obie Award-winning Theater in Quarantine have reimagin
 ed their streaming hit\, The 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy\, as a mind-bending i
 n-person experience — a slapstick adventure and poignant meditation on the 
 tug-of-war between the versions of ourselves we can never escape.\n\nThe 7t
 h Voyage of Egon Tichy contains mild adult language and situations but is a
 ppropriate for audiences of all ages.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:The 2026 Buchdahl Lecture will focus on over 300\,000 years of 
 human history\, using the stories of our ancestors and Indigenous cultures 
 to show how we have survived climate change\, war\, diseases and countless 
 other challenges. We will explore the story of Egypt's so-called Old Kingdo
 m collapse in 2200 BCE\, learning how that time period is a mirror for life
  today and how societies respond to concurrent crises.  The archaeological 
 site of el Lisht\, Egypt's capital from the Middle Kingdom (1800 BCE)\, wil
 l provide a case study for what might be possible following a period of mul
 tiple crises. What we will learn is that the imminent societal collapse pro
 moted by countless tech bros and podcasters is simply a lie. Our ancestors 
 nearly became extinct almost a million years ago\, and yet\, they persisted
 \, evolving into homo sapiens. Our human story is one of survival and hope.
  A better world is possible\, with the road well-lit via evidence from the 
 archaeological evidence and Indigenous wisdom.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Removal (Monroe)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Union County Wildlife Chapter and community volunteers to remove invasive species along the Carolina Thread Trail at the Union County Agricultural Center. Invasive plants are non-native introduced plants that do not support native wildlife. They are very aggressive\, outcompete wildlife-friendly plants\, and take over natural areas. Removing invasive species is often the first step to enhancing and restoring habitat for wildlife. \nVolunteers will discover how to identify invasive plants and practice removing them by hand and with tools. Please bring your favorite pair of loppers\, pruning saw\, and a pair of gloves. We will have some tools available. Ages 13+ please. \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

DESCRIPTION:Join us for Rivers and Resistance: Freedom Seeking in Eastern N
 C\, a transformative\, place-based workshop designed for middle and high sc
 hool teachers.\n\n·       Virtual Event Kick Off (via Zoom) on Thursday\, M
 arch 26 (5 PM - 7:30 PM)\n·       Immersive Learning in Eastern NC Friday\,
  April 10 - Sunday\, April 12\, 2026  \n \nAPPLICATION DEADLINE is February
  22\n \nEvent Overview\nThroughout North Carolina's early history\, many en
 slaved people carved out freedom for themselves\, some using the waterways\
 , swamps\, and diverse landscapes of eastern North Carolina as pathways to 
 liberation. This immersive weekend experience will highlight the courageous
  acts of resistance and resilience by those who escaped or aided others in 
 their journey to freedom.\n \nParticipants will explore the historical sign
 ificance of key sites\, including DNCR's Somerset Place and Historic Edento
 n\, delving into the stories of enslaved people like Harriet Jacobs and man
 y others. Through interaction with top scholars\, tours\, discussions\, and
  hands-on activities\, the workshop will weave together history and science
 \, connecting the natural ecology of the region—its rivers\, swamps\, and f
 orests—with the survival strategies of freedom seekers.\n \nAttendees will 
 also have the unique opportunity to canoe the very waterways enslaved peopl
 e navigated\, offering an immersive experience in the natural environment t
 hat shaped their journeys. Guided by DNCR's NC Museum of Natural Sciences\,
  teachers will gain insights into the region’s ecosystems and learn how wat
 erways and landscapes influenced the history\, culture and experiences of f
 reedom seekers. \n\nIn addition to examining the physical landscapes of res
 istance\, we will explore cultural strategies of survival and freedom\, suc
 h as the role of foodways in sustaining communities. We will be joined by A
 dé Carrena\, an award-winning chef\, culinary artist\, storyteller\, and fi
 lmmaker\, who will guide us through the rich tapestry of Southern culinary 
 traditions and their deep roots in African diasporic culture. As she leads 
 our group in preparing a shared meal\, participants will experience firstha
 nd how recipes became vessels of memory and resilience.\n\nEqually powerful
  is the role of music and spirituals\, songs that served as both comfort an
 d covert communication\, embedding directions and encouragement within thei
 r melodies. Acclaimed scholar and singer Mary D. Williams will join us for 
 a private performance sharing some of the spirituals that were a source of 
 strength through generations. These cultural practices were not mere expres
 sions of creativity\; they were acts of quiet defiance\, sustaining hope an
 d forging pathways to liberation.\n \nTeachers will leave with new perspect
 ives on integrating history\, culture\, science\, and nature into comprehen
 sive lessons\, as well as strategies for teaching the history of slavery an
 d freedom seeking in effective and responsible ways.\n \nAttending educator

  the collaboration platform GitHub. Git allows you to keep track of changes
  to your code\, easily revert to previous versions\, and “tag” versions of 
 code used in publications so that the exact code used can be retrieved at a
  later date. GitHub allows Git users to collaborate with each other on proj
 ects by managing simultaneous changes to the same files and allowing users 
 to review and discuss each others’ code. Git and Github are applicable to a
 ny text-based programming or analysis language\, including R\, Python\, Sta
 ta\, Julia\, and others.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the “Modular

DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp

 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the

SUMMARY:Weekly Game Night!
DESCRIPTION:Durham Geeks\nWe meet at Moon Dog Meadery under Joe Van Gogh o
 n Broad Street every Monday night. We have loads of games (some belong to 
 MoonDog\, some are brought by attendees)\, a fun and welcoming group of fo
 lks (always eager to have more\, however!)\, and there are always folks ea
 ger to teach games to those who haven't played certain titles.\n\nMoondog 
 has a growing collection of canned and bottled brews\, ciders\, and colas 
 in addition to their in-house-brewed meads. There are also some snacks lik
 e chips and popcorn. Sometimes\, folks bring in other treats to share. If 
 you do\, please mark them as containing any common allergens.\n\nOutside f
 ood (delivered\, brought in\, or homemade) is welcomed and encouraged. Out
 side drinks are not. Since the venue does not prepare food\, **dogs are al
 lowed and welcomed.** (Dogs are very friendly and welcoming\, too\, but th
 ey mostly roam around to collect ear scritches and love. If you're not com
 fortable with dogs around\, let us know\, and we'll try to accommodate.)\n
 \nBring games\, friends\, and a welcoming spirit. We're excited to have yo
 u with us!\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Geeks

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: “Aftersun” (Charlotte Wells\, 2022)
DESCRIPTION:Set during a modest holiday at a Turkish resort in the early 2000s\, Aftersun approaches coming of age obliquely\, through memory and retrospection. Stunningly shot on 35mm film\, which is contrasted with mini DV home movie video footage\, the plot follows young Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her father Calum (Paul Mescal). But it is the adult Sophie’s somber attempt to reconstruct this formative trip that gives the story its emotional charge. Coming of age here is not marked by clear lessons or dramatic turning points\, but by the gradual\, dawning recognition of a parent’s fragility—and of the limits of childhood understanding. \n  \nThe film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at the Chelsea Theater\, 1129 Weaver Dairy Road\, Suite AB\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514. Click here for more information on theater pricing; tickets are free for UNC-Chapel Hill students. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series:\nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men.

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.\n\nSource: NC State University

 k\,” or\, “All we do is fight.” Have you ever been stuck in traffic thanks 
 to an accident? Maybe you said to yourself\, “I knew I shouldn’t have gone 
 this way\,” or “This always happens to me.” Statements like these are commo
 n reactions to scenarios in our lives\, but they are inaccurate and distort
  how we see ourselves and the world around us. This session will examine th
 e 10 cognitive distortions and how they impact our mood and create faulty b

  identify ways to challenge negative thoughts and limit their impact on our

SUMMARY:Travel CHINA like a local! Virtual QnA [x-posted]
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh & Triangle Activities Meetup Group\nPutting out feeler
 s for curious\, cooperative 'comrades' to explore quiet corners of Old Cat
 hay! Trip date TBD - waiting for airfares to come down.\n\nThis will happe
 n on Google Meet.\n\n**CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR MEETING LINK!**\n\n[Comment 
 if you are able to log onto the link but don't see me - in the past Google
  has let two meetings with the same link open\, each person thinking the o
 ther didn't show up. So comment here and we'll see if we can fix it. :-) ]
 \n\nI've been traveling to China for 27 years. Join me for a unique\, off 
 the beaten track culture immersion adventure!\n\nComfort NOT guaranteed! L
 OTS of walking! This trip is NOT for everyone but everyone who has come wi
 th me so far has LOVED it!\n\nItinerary NOT guaranteed so as to maximize e
 xperience! Spontaneous private zheng concert in a riverside pavilion? Let'
 s stop and enjoy! Weather is forecast to be rain in the mountains? Let's g
 o to the ancient village instead.\n\nCosts currently unknown but should be
  under $100/day for ALL in-country necessities: food\, lodging\, entrance 
 fees\, ground transport. Whatever price I end up quoting will NOT include 
 transport to/from China\, alcohol\, upgrades to lodging\\*\, upgrades to i
 n-country transport\\*.\n\nYou can do it cheaper with a big box tour. If s
 trict time schedules\, overpriced shopping\, industrial restaurant food\, 
 and being kept away from locals is good enough for you than that's your be
 st bet. If unique\, real China\, great food\, insider knowledge with eye f
 or western comforts\\*\\*\, and turn on a dime\\*\\*\\* [a mao?] escapades
  are for you than come with me!\n\nOnly seven people! Small and 'nimble'\\
 *\\*\\*!\n\nHave you already been to China? Already have seen the Forbidde
 n City and Great Wall? No worries! Big box tours do NOT go where I go!\n\n
 Have you never been to China and NEED to see the big sights? No problem! I
  can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall\, Forbidden City\,
  Temple of Heaven\, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hi
 dden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded pe
 ople so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers 
 with shop-hating history buffs\, or long distance hikers with casual strol
 lers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO t
 rips\, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/den
 y as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe
  next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to g
 et a hint of what one might see. No guarantees of ANYTHING! China changes 
 very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the
  beaten track. I said 'adventure'!\n\n\\*\\*Sometimes western comforts are
  just not there. Deep in the countryside villages rarely have western toil
 ets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Quick change of plans is relative in China\; western expe
 ctations are best set aside and an embrace the new/unknown/surprise attitu
 de is highly recommended. But that's what a cultural adventure is all abou
 t!\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh & Triangle Activities

 an Prisoners of the Civil War\," on Tuesday\, Feb. 24 at 6 p.m. at Flyleaf 
 Books in Chapel Hill. A book-signing at 5:30 p.m. will precede the event.\n
 \n \n\nIt is newly estimated that 750\,000 soldiers died in the American Ci
 vil War. But less well-known than the war’s death toll are the roughly 400\
 ,000 Union and Confederate troops who were captured and imprisoned. Many PO
 Ws died from starvation\, dysentery\, and exposure\, and at the worst of th
 e prison pens\, more than 30\,000 soldiers were caged in the equivalent of 
 ten city block. "Fate Worse than Hell" contemplates the roots and consequen
 ces of this mass incarceration from America’s bloodiest conflict.\n\n \n\nB
 rundage will discuss the book with David Blight\, Sterling Professor of His
 tory at Yale University.\n\n \n\nRegister at the Flyleaf Books link.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Human bodies are composed of complex physiological architecture
  to support survival\, including a beating heart and a dynamic immune syste
 m. This same architecture also undergirds our everyday emotional lives\, af
 fecting how we infer each other’s emotional states and sense that our feeli
 ngs are “shared” in a given moment. In this talk\, Dr. Mallory Feldman will
  share the science of the body’s role in emotional experience\, and Dr. Cat
 herine Berman will discuss when and how co-experienced emotions (particular
 ly positive emotions) may shape well-being\, including in fleeting social i
 nteractions. Join us on Tuesday\, February 24\, from 6:00 to 7:00 PM at the

DESCRIPTION:Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith incr
 eased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come inc
 reased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within indi
 viduals. Additionally\, technological advances have made the collection of 
 person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interes
 ted in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day cours
 e focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions
  concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individ
 uals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time s
 eries data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily
  diary data\; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary s
 ampling (ESM)\; passive data from cell phones\; and other psychophysiologic
 al data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling fr
 ameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterati
 ve Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore pr
 ocesses as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-speci
 fic network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network
  models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks
  will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between meth
 ods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during th
 is course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series
  analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues
  with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFit
 ting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches fo
 r summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course
  is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling fram
 eworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples 
 with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to gi
 ve learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\
 nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link 
 access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:In this course\, participants will learn how to keep track of t
 he code they use in their research using the version control system Git and
  the collaboration platform GitHub. Git allows you to keep track of changes
  to your code\, easily revert to previous versions\, and “tag” versions of 
 code used in publications so that the exact code used can be retrieved at a
  later date. GitHub allows Git users to collaborate with each other on proj
 ects by managing simultaneous changes to the same files and allowing users 
 to review and discuss each others’ code. Git and Github are applicable to a
 ny text-based programming or analysis language\, including R\, Python\, Sta
 ta\, Julia\, and others.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the “Modular 
 Design and Automated Testing with R” course in April.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Voices Rising: Save Our Sounds (Greensboro)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Triad Wild! Chapter for a conversation about one of North Carolina’s most treasured natural resources: our estuarine sounds. Our sounds\, most notably the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound\, are known for their stunning coastal landscapes\, immense biodiversity\, historical significance\, economic importance\, and are the largest estuarine system in the nation managed by one state. Estuaries\, sometimes described as “rainforests of the sea”\, are crucial because they filter pollutants\, provide critical nurseries for fish and shellfish (supporting fisheries)\, as well as economic benefits through recreation\, tourism\, and jobs\, all while supporting immense biodiversity. Our shallow sounds are in deep trouble for several reasons\, not the least of which is our fisheries management. It’s not too late to recognize and to cherish North Carolina’s natural treasures for the gift they are and undertake-with dogged determination-the effort to restore their abundance\, for humans and the environment. Restoration is not a pipe dream; it is just waiting for us to get on board.  \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

DESCRIPTION:Join African-American Legacy Project Coordinator and award-winn
 ing textile artist Margarette Joyner as she leads workshop participants in 
 the art of crafting handmade dolls that replicate the ones enslaved women w
 ould have created for their own children. As Ms. Joyner states\, " “Hand se
 wing is becoming a dying art\, but there are many benefits to the art form.
   You’re using your hands and eyes in coordination\, which is great practic
 e for other activities. You’re also working on fine motor skills\, which ca
 n be helpful for tasks like handwriting and using a computer mouse.  But th
 e best thing about hand sewing is that it’s a relaxing activity. When you’r
 e focusing on the task at hand\, you can forget about all of your troubles 
 and just enjoy the moment. Sometimes it’s nice to take a break from thinkin
 g about things and just work on something creative.  So let’s learn how to 
 create a handmade doll similar to the primitive dolls made by the enslaved 
 women of Colonial Williamsburg.” \n\nThe activity will take place in Roseda
 le's kitchen cellar\, and seating is limited to 15. Materials will be provi
 ded.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:Department of Art and Art History\n\n \n\n“Like the Dawn of Cre
 ation: Byzantine Fragments in the Modern Imagination”\n\n \n\nThis talk exp
 lores how Byzantium operates as a queer cipher in modern culture\, appearin
 g as an adjectival modifier\, “the Byzantine\,” rather than as a distinct h
 istorical referent. Analyzing Gore Vidal’s 1959 adaptation of Tennessee Wil
 liams’s Suddenly\, Last Summer\, Betancourt demonstrates how Byzantine refe
 rences encode queer identity through the film’s absent protagonist\, whose 
 unspeakable sexuality mirrors Byzantium’s own unintelligibility. Drawing on
  extensive archival research\, he shows how “the Byzantine” articulated cod
 ed queerness for these writers and artists. This talk proposes reimagining 
 Byzantine art history through modes of “queer fragmentation\,” recognizing 
 Byzantine elements across temporal boundaries.\n\n \n\nRoland Betancourt is
  a scholar of Byzantium and modern popular culture with research that lies 
 firmly at the intersection of the history of science and technology\, intel
 lectual history\, and the history of art. Dr. Betancourt is the Andrew W. M
 ellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the 
 National Gallery of Art in Washington\, DC from 2024-2026. He also holds th
 e honor of Chancellor’s Professor\, Department of Art History\, at the Univ
 ersity of California\, Irvine. He is also the author of four monographs\, i
 ncluding The Secrets We Keep: Hidden Histories of the Byzantine Empire (The
  Getty\, 2024)\, Performing the Gospels in Byzantium: Sight\, Sound\, and S
 pace in the Divine Liturgy (Cambridge University Press\, 2021)\, Byzantine 
 Intersectionality: Sexuality\, Gender\, and Race in the Middle Ages (Prince
 ton University Press\, 2020)\, and Sight\, Touch\, and Imagination in Byzan
 tium (Cambridge University Press\, 2018). Betancourt’s forthcoming book\, D
 isneyland and the Rise of Automation: How Technology Created the Happiest P
 lace on Earth (Princeton University Press\, 2026)\, traces the origins and 
 evolution of the theme park’s technical innovations during Disneyland’s fir
 st three decades in operation\, exploring how engineers reimagined the syst
 ems and machines of industrial manufacturing and the military.\n\n \n\nA we
 eknight or daytime permit is now required after 5:00 pm on weekdays. No per
 mit is required from 5:00 pm Friday through 7:30 am Monday. A $1.00 one-nig
 ht pass is available in selected lots. More information can be found HERE.\

DESCRIPTION:The history of how the Declaration of Independence came to be i
 s familiar to many Americans.\nLess familiar and equally important is the s
 ubsequent history of the document. How did the Declaration go from being a 
 congressional PR document of moderate significance to becoming the defining
  document of American history and one of the most influential documents in 
 the history of the world.\n\nThough it served an important purpose in 1776\
 , the Declaration was not particularly noted or celebrated in the decades a
 fter the Revolution.\n\nIn this talk\, historian Michael D. Hattem will dis
 cuss how groups from across the political spectrum have redefined the Decla
 ration and its ideals in an effort to make them more relevant and meaningfu
 l to their own times. In the process\, he will show how the Declaration bec
 ame "American Scripture\," as well as a model for independence-seeking peop
 le around the world.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:Knowing how to develop various types of qualitative research st
 udies to respond to complex research and community priorities is rewarding\
 , but can also be daunting. This short course provides practical skills for
  conducting various types of qualitative research in U.S. and international
  settings. First\, students will learn about the epistemological and theore
 tical foundations of qualitative research and the range of methodologies cu
 rrently used such as programmatic qualitative research\, ethnography\, grou
 nded theory\, phenomenology\, and case studies. Next\, the short course pro
 vides step-by-step instructions on how to develop and implement various qua
 litative methods and designs\, such as interviews\, focus groups\, and obse
 rvations – and how to handle single- versus multi-method qualitative studie
 s or cross-sectional versus longitudinal qualitative studies. Students will
  learn basic principles for data generation\, ethics\, and data quality in 
 qualitative studies. We will also focus on practical steps for data analysi
 s\, including data management\, transcription\, and coding. Traditionally\,
  qualitative research is conducted in-person\, and students will be trained
  for in-person interactions. However\, the short course’s concluding module
  teaches students about techniques required for contemporary qualitative re
 search online and by phone\, including consideration of recent advances in 
 conducting qualitative research using social media. This course is designed
  to provide new knowledge for both introductory and intermediate students. 
 Registration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link a

DESCRIPTION:Grief is often associated with death\, but loss takes many form
 s—shifts in identity\, changing roles\, unmet expectations\, and the quiet 
 disappointments that shape our lives. Led jointly by a faculty member and a
  campus chaplain\, this session integrates research-based insights with ref
 lective and compassionate practices.   \n\nDesigned to support both persona
 l reflection and broader community impact\, the seminar will offer practica
 l tools for navigating grief individually and strategies for integrating th
 ese concepts into community spaces. Participants will examine how grief inf
 luences identity\, relationships\, and sense of purpose\, while considering
  how individuals can honor what has been lost while remaining open to growt
 h and change. You will leave with a deeper understanding of grief as a shar
 ed human experience—and with approaches for fostering compassion\, resilien
 ce\, and continuity in times of change.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:The Abbey Speaker Series marks the 250th anniversary of America
 n independence with a discussion of Race and the American Founding at 5:30p
 m on Thursday\, February 26 in the Frank Porter Graham Student Union Audito
 rium.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence proclaimed equality —”all men are 
 created equal”—but the Constitution tolerated slavery. Abolitionists\, Abra
 ham Lincoln\, and civil rights leaders later wielded the Declaration’s word
 s\, but its principal author\, Thomas Jefferson\, owned slaves\, and the De
 claration refers to Native Americans as “merciless savages.” How should we 
 think about this founding paradox that has haunted the nation for 250 years
 ? Historian Annette Gordon-Reed and political theorist Lucas Morel will exp
 lore these and related issues in a discussion moderated by Carolina Public 
 Humanities Executive Director Max Owre.\n\nStudents who attend in person ca
 n earn CLE credit. No tickets necessary\; seating is first-come\, first-ser

DESCRIPTION:Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith incr
 eased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come inc
 reased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within indi
 viduals. Additionally\, technological advances have made the collection of 
 person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interes
 ted in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day cours
 e focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions
  concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individ
 uals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time s
 eries data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily
  diary data\; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary s
 ampling (ESM)\; passive data from cell phones\; and other psychophysiologic
 al data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling fr
 ameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterati
 ve Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore pr
 ocesses as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-speci
 fic network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network
  models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks
  will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between meth
 ods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during th
 is course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series
  analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues
  with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFit
 ting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches fo
 r summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course
  is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling fram
 eworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples 
 with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to gi
 ve learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\
 nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link 
 access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:The 11th Annual Symposium of the Art Student Graduate Organization - “Anachronic Enchantment: Temporalities in Visual and Material Culture"
DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday\, February 28 from 9:00 AM- 2:30 PM. Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general audience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to say that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essentially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However\, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, meaning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachronistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachronic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\, adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameters of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this symposium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdisciplinary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with temporality to construct new and alternative histories; how meaning and interpretation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own scholarly and curatorial practices; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: Ackland Art Museum

SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Species Removal (Roper)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Wildlife Habitat Stewards of Northeastern NC Chapter and Spruill Conservation Farm for a hands-on habitat restoration project on Saturday\, February 28\, from 10 am to 12 pm. Together\, volunteers will focus on removing invasive heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) along the farm’s wooded nature trail. \nHeavenly bamboo poses a threat to local ecosystems as it spreads quickly when birds eat its berries and disperse the seeds\, allowing dense thickets to form that crowd out native plants and reduce habitat quality for wildlife. Its berries are also highly toxic\, releasing cyanide when eaten\, and birds such as cedar waxwings have been known to die after consuming large quantities. \nThis volunteer effort will involve digging\, prying\, cutting\, and lifting plant roots\, so participants should be prepared for physical activity. It’s a great opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the trail and the wildlife that depends on it.\n \nREGISTER HERE\n\nSource: NC Wildlife Federation

DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North
  Carolina at Chapel Hill on\nSaturday\, February 28 from 9:00 AM- 2:30 PM. 
 Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general a
 udience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to sa
 y that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essen
 tially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. Howeve
 r\, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, me
 aning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachr
 onistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachro
 nic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\
 , adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the paramete
 rs of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this sympos
 ium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdiscipl
 inary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented
  across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to
  interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how
  alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to 
 this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with tempo
 rality to construct new and alternative histories\; how meaning and interpr
 etation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own s
 cholarly and curatorial practices\; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt 
 and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

  in Visual and Material Culture\n\n \n\nKeynote Speaker: André Dombrowski\n
 \n \n\nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to say th
 at it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essential
 ly\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However\, 
 has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, meanin
 g our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachronis
 tic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachronic 
 to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\, ad
 ds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameters o
 f their chronological circumstances.”\n\n \n\nWith this in mind\, this symp
 osium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdisci
 plinary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represent
 ed across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek 
 to interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and h
 ow alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central t
 o this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with tem
 porality to construct new and alternative histories\; how meaning and inter
 pretation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own
  scholarly and curatorial practices\; and how ephemeral forms of art disrup
 t and complicate traditional art historical methods.\n\n \n\nImage: Claude

DESCRIPTION:Take a stroll through the calming scenery of Swift Creek Bluffs!\nWith a focus on looking for signs of spring\, we will saunter rather than power-walk through the woods. Join TLC Trail Guide and naturalist\, Julie Hall\, to walk slowly for 1.5 miles and stop for moments of silence to appreciate the nourishing wonder and beauty of nature!  You will have an opportunity to hike up the "Stairway to Heaven" and take in the lush hardwood canopy and meandering Swift Creek below\, while sitting on a bench at the top of the 100-ft bluffs. \n\nThis is a free event\, but preregistration is required. Due to the size of the parking lot\, we will keep the hiking group small and ask that you register by vehicle rather than individual. Feel free to bring guests but please carpool to ensure we have enough space in the parking lot.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf registration is full\, please fill out this waitlist form by February 26th.\n\nCurrent Mask Policy: TLC seeks to build a supportive\, mask-friendly environment in all collaborations with staff and the public. Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated\, or if that makes you feel most comfortable. We will have masks available if you would like to wear one during an event. We also encourage those eligible to be vaccinated to get their Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. If you are experiencing any Covid-related symptoms\, please stay home and attend a program another day. Our top priority is to create a safe environment for our community.

DESCRIPTION:Organizations are investing in benefits to improve employee wel
 l-being and taking on initiatives to foster a culture of well-being in the 
 workplace. However\, many employees still feel that their job is an obstacl
 e to their well-being rather than a help. What can you do as a manager to s
 hift that perception? Join Learning and Organizational Development for a se
 ssion that will provide practical ways to show employees that you and your 
 organization support their well-being.\n\nThis workshop is part of L&OD's L
 EAD Events\, an initiative that provides employees with opportunities to le
 arn or refresh skills that can help them grow their careers. LEAD Events ar
 e a component of L&OD's Leadership Education and Development\, or LEAD\, pr
 ogram.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:Durham Geeks\nWe meet at Moon Dog Meadery under Joe Van Gogh o

 MoonDog\, some are brought by attendees)\, a fun and welcoming group of fo

 ger to teach games to those who haven't played certain titles.\n\nMoondog 
 has a growing collection of canned and bottled brews\, ciders\, and colas 
 in addition to their in-house-brewed meads. There are also some snacks lik
 e chips and popcorn. Sometimes\, folks bring in other treats to share. If 
 you do\, please mark them as containing any common allergens.\n\nOutside f
 ood (delivered\, brought in\, or homemade) is welcomed and encouraged. Out
 side drinks are not. Since the venue does not prepare food\, **dogs are al
 lowed and welcomed.** (Dogs are very friendly and welcoming\, too\, but th
 ey mostly roam around to collect ear scritches and love. If you're not com
 fortable with dogs around\, let us know\, and we'll try to accommodate.)\n
 \nBring games\, friends\, and a welcoming spirit. We're excited to have yo
 u with us!\n\nSource: Meetup: Durham Geeks

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: "Boyhood" (Richard Linklater\, 2014)
DESCRIPTION:Filmed over twelve years with the same cast members who conspicuously age from segment to segment\, Boyhood offers one of cinema’s most literal and radical explorations of coming of age. Following Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from early childhood through his first days of college\, the film refuses traditional narrative climaxes in favor of accumulation: small moments\, shifting family dynamics\, and incremental changes in perception as time itself figures as the “main character.” Linklater’s method allows us to experience maturation as something lived\, uneven\, and quietly profound. \nThe film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at The Lumina Theater (620 Market St\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27516). \nTickets are free for all audience members\, and registration is required via The Lumina’s webpage. Please click here to reserve your free ticket.

DESCRIPTION:Broken Beakers and Brilliant Minds: Fixing The Machinery of Sci
 ence \n\n  \n\nFrom the energy crisis and feeding eight billion people to d
 efeating cancer and coping with climate change\, humanity faces some rather
  large challenges today. To tackle them\, we need science running like a we
 ll-oiled machine. Unfortunately\, it has more often resembled a clunky old 
 engine: loud\, temperamental and prone to breaking down at the worst possib
 le moment. \n\n  \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding cuts for scienc
 e’s current woes\, but focusing only on money rather misses the point. Many
  of science’s biggest problems have been around for years\, sometimes centu
 ries. Scientists have long been criticized\, sidelined or attacked for havi
 ng ideas that were too new\, too inconvenient or simply too correct for the
  people in power at the time. Even truly unscientific behaviors\, like char
 acter assassination and fraud\, are not modern inventions… though they do s
 eem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance. \n\n  \n\nThe good news is that l
 ongstanding problems are not the same as unsolvable ones. Join Matt Kaplan\
 , science correspondent at The Economist and author of I Told You So! Scien
 tists Who Were Ridiculed\, Exiled and Imprisoned… For Being Right\, for a s
 pirited and insightful talk on the history of these endemic issues and what
  we can do to finally consign them to the scientific scrap heap.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Filmed over twelve years with the same cast members who conspic
 uously age from segment to segment\, Boyhood offers one of cinema’s most li
 teral and radical explorations of coming of age. Following Mason (Ellar Col
 trane) from early childhood through his first days of college\, the film re
 fuses traditional narrative climaxes in favor of accumulation: small moment
 s\, shifting family dynamics\, and incremental changes in perception as tim
 e itself figures as the “main character.” Linklater’s method allows us to e
 xperience maturation as something lived\, uneven\, and quietly profound. \n
 The film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Disting
 uished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be
  screened at 7:30 p.m. at The Lumina Theater (620 Market St\, Chapel Hill\,
  NC 27516). \nTickets are free for all audience members\, and registration 
 is required via The Lumina’s webpage. Please click here to reserve your fre
 e ticket. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by 
 scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackla
 nd Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that acc
 ompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This seme

DESCRIPTION:Triangle Hiking and Outdoors Group\nI know that it’s hard to
  imagine\, given the weather we’ve had from. Mid January to almost mid F
 ebruary\, but it’s time to prepare for the 2026 season of the Tuesday af
 ter work bike rides. This seasonal\, weekly event has been going on since 
 2011! It will begin with just over 1 hour of riding\, and as the days get 
 longer we’ll increase the ride time and distance tracking sunset.\nWe'll
  be starting near Southpoint and final starting point will be sent out Mon
 day evening. Make sure that your bike is in good working order - tires hol
 d air and are up to pressure\, brakes and shifters work and your chain has
  been oiled. We'll be riding just about 1 hours and about 12 miles. The ri
 de is fairly flat and shaded and our pace will be moderate (about 13 mph a
 verage). I recommend a hard tail or hybrid bike\, but if you really want t
 o bring a road bike it's ok\, though you'll likely be a bit bored. Unicycl
 es....? I'll be eating after the ride at a restaurant. You're welcome to j
 oin me if you like. Helmets are required and by signing up you agree to TH
 OG liability waiver statement. Please Note!! Any cancellation less than 30
  hours before the beginning of the event will be considered a "no show"\n\nSource: Meetup: Triangle Hiking & Outdoors

SUMMARY:Spring Wildflower Hike
DESCRIPTION:Join TLC on an exploration of Swift Creek Bluffs to see what's in bloom!\nCome and explore the ephemeral beauties and early bloomers that carpet the preserve this time of year with TLC Trail Guide Mary Abrams. You are encouraged to bring plant ID guides and have apps such as iNaturalist and Seek downloaded to your mobile device for extra help identifying your findings. We will walk less than 1 mile\, but the climb up the stairway to heaven will provide a challenge—and reward us with great views. This is a free event\, but preregistration is required.\n\nDue to the size of the parking lot\, we will keep the hiking group small and ask that you register by vehicle rather than individual. Feel free to bring guests but please carpool to ensure we have enough space in the parking lot.\n\n\n\nIf registration is full\, please fill out this waitlist form by March 11th at 10am.\n\nCurrent Mask Policy: TLC seeks to build a supportive\, mask-friendly environment in all collaborations with staff and the public. Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated\, or if that makes you feel most comfortable. We will have masks available if you would like to wear one during an event. We also encourage those eligible to be vaccinated to get their Covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. If you are experiencing any Covid-related symptoms\, please stay home and attend a program another day. Our top priority is to create a safe environment for our community. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nSource: Triangle Land Conservancy

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Plug and Play: A Guide to Planting Perennial Plugs (virtual)
DESCRIPTION:Most gardeners are familiar with planting container-grown perennials\, but using plugs requires a shift in mindset and technique. These young starter plants\, grown in trays instead of pots\, offer distinct advantages: they are cost-effective\, easier to plant and establish quickly. They are ideal for large areas\, slopes and under trees. However\, not every gardener is familiar with plugs. Planting them successfully takes a bit of practical know-how that even experienced gardeners will appreciate refining. Join Shannon Currey\, education and outreach at Izel Native Plant\, to learn the pros and cons of plugs\, when they’re most appropriate and best practices for handling\, planting and managing them. With these essentials\, you’ll be planting like a pro! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

DESCRIPTION:Join NC State Industry Extension Services for a webinar that wi
 ll focus on smart manufacturing and the opportunities available through a f
 ederally funded grant for small and medium-sized manufacturers in North Car
 olina who are ready to adopt technology. The webinar's goal is to provide t
 argeted technical assistance to small- to medium-sized manufacturers to inc
 rease awareness of\, access to and implementation of innovative smart manuf
 acturing technologies. The benefits of smart manufacturing are:\n\nImproved
  efficiency: Smart factories can monitor equipment performance and automate
  complex processes\, improving accuracy and reducing human error.Increased 
 productivity: Smart factories can use data to identify issues\, such as whe
 n a machine slows down production and then use artificial intelligence syst
 ems to resolve the issues.Long-term cost savings: Smart factories can use p
 redictive maintenance to identify potential problems early and address them
  at a convenient time\, which can save money.Greater flexibility: Smart fac
 tories can scale production quickly to meet changing demand and can customi
 ze products to meet specific customer needs.You can complete a short applic
 ation to find out if your company is ready to participate in the program. F
 or more information about the webinar\, visit the NC State Industry Extensi
 on Services' website.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:In 2019\, YouTube creator Mariana Colín started building her fi
 lm analysis YouTube channel\, The Morbid Zoo\, as an exercise in developing
  the video essay format as a legitimate mode of academic publishing. Since 
 then\, her videos have been viewed over 9 million times. YouTube is accessi
 ble and customizable\, offering a way to engage directly with a nonacademic
  audience. However\, it is also isolating\, biased toward particular kinds 
 of engagement\; it is also deeply politically fraught. In this talk\, Colín
  will share what she’s discovered about social media’s academic use — its s
 uccesses\, its failures and its possible futures.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Raleigh & Triangle Activities Meetup Group\nPutting out feeler
 s for curious\, cooperative 'comrades' to explore quiet corners of Old Cat
 hay! Trip date TBD - waiting for airfares to come down.\n\nThis will happe
 n on Google Meet.\n\n**CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR MEETING LINK!**\n\n[Comment 
 if you are able to log onto the link but don't see me - in the past Google
  has let two meetings with the same link open\, each person thinking the o
 ther didn't show up. So comment here and we'll see if we can fix it. :-) ]
 \n\nI've been traveling to China for 27 years. Join me for a unique\, off 
 the beaten track culture immersion adventure!\n\nComfort NOT guaranteed! L
 OTS of walking! This trip is NOT for everyone but everyone who has come wi
 th me so far has LOVED it!\n\nItinerary NOT guaranteed so as to maximize e
 xperience! Spontaneous private zheng concert in a riverside pavilion? Let'
 s stop and enjoy! Weather is forecast to be rain in the mountains? Let's g
 o to the ancient village instead.\n\nCosts currently unknown but should be
  under $100/day for ALL in-country necessities: food\, lodging\, entrance 
 fees\, ground transport. Whatever price I end up quoting will NOT include 
 transport to/from China\, alcohol\, upgrades to lodging\\*\, upgrades to i
 n-country transport\\*.\n\nYou can do it cheaper with a big box tour. If s
 trict time schedules\, overpriced shopping\, industrial restaurant food\, 
 and being kept away from locals is good enough for you than that's your be
 st bet. If unique\, real China\, great food\, insider knowledge with eye f
 or western comforts\\*\\*\, and turn on a dime\\*\\*\\* [a mao?] escapades
  are for you than come with me!\n\nOnly seven people! Small and 'nimble'\\
 *\\*\\*!\n\nHave you already been to China? Already have seen the Forbidde
 n City and Great Wall? No worries! Big box tours do NOT go where I go!\n\n
 Have you never been to China and NEED to see the big sights? No problem! I
  can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall\, Forbidden City\,
  Temple of Heaven\, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hi
 dden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded pe
 ople so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers 
 with shop-hating history buffs\, or long distance hikers with casual strol
 lers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO t
 rips\, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/den
 y as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe
  next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to g
 et a hint of what one might see. No guarantees of ANYTHING! China changes 
 very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the
  beaten track. I said 'adventure'!\n\n\\*\\*Sometimes western comforts are
  just not there. Deep in the countryside villages rarely have western toil
 ets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Quick change of plans is relative in China\; western expe
 ctations are best set aside and an embrace the new/unknown/surprise attitu
 de is highly recommended. But that's what a cultural adventure is all abou
 t!\n\nSource: Meetup: Raleigh & Triangle Activities

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: "Crooklyn" (Spike Lee\, 1994)
DESCRIPTION:Set in 1970s Brooklyn\, Crooklyn recounts childhood from the perspective of nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris)\, whose coming of age unfolds within the rhythms of Black family life\, neighborhood culture\, and social constraint. The film balances warmth and humor with moments of rupture\, revealing how maturity often arrives through confrontation with authority\, injustice\, and grief. Lee presents growing up as both deeply personal and inseparable from place\, race\, and community—an education shaped as much by environment as by experience. \n  \nThe film will be introduced by Daelena Tinnin-Gadson\, Assistant Professor of Black Film Studies and African American Literature. \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at the Varsity Theatre (123 East Franklin Street\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514). Tickets are free\, but must be reserved on the Ackland’s webpage. Register below. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nSource: Ackland Art Museum

  top of an ancient spring said to have healing waters. While she goes about
  her chores and prepares to become the inn’s next caretaker\, Okko discover
 s some spirits live there that only she can see — not scary ones but welcom
 ing ghosts who keep her company\, play games and help her navigate her new 
 environment. The inn’s motto is that it welcomes all and will reject none\,
  and this is soon put to the test as a string of new guests challenge Okko’
 s ability to be a gracious host. But ultimately\, Okko discovers that dedic
 ating herself to others becomes the key to taking care of herself.\n\nThe f
 ilm's runtime is 1 hour\, 34 minutes. The movie is in Japanese with English
  subtitles. \n\nThe Global Film Series is a collaboration between the NC St
 ate University Libraries and NC State’s Office of Global Engagement. This s
 creening is in partnership with NC State’s Women’s Center in celebration of
  Women’s History Month.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Set in 1970s Brooklyn\, Crooklyn recounts childhood from the pe
 rspective of nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris)\, whose coming of
  age unfolds within the rhythms of Black family life\, neighborhood culture
 \, and social constraint. The film balances warmth and humor with moments o
 f rupture\, revealing how maturity often arrives through confrontation with
  authority\, injustice\, and grief. Lee presents growing up as both deeply 
 personal and inseparable from place\, race\, and community—an education sha
 ped as much by environment as by experience. \n  \nThe film will be introdu
 ced by Daelena Tinnin-Gadson\, Assistant Professor of Black Film Studies an
 d African American Literature. \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at
  the Varsity Theatre (123 East Franklin Street\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514). T
 ickets are free\, but must be reserved on the Ackland’s webpage. Register b
 elow. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scan
 ning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackland F
 ilm Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompa
 nies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester
 ’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie th
 eaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackla
 nd Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Departme
 nt of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Religious studies professor Hugo Méndez (FFP ’22) will give a l
 ecture titled “Writing a New History of the Biblical Books of John\,” based
  on his recent research. Register for the event here. (This was previously 
 scheduled for Jan. 30.)\n\nThe Christian Bible contains four texts attribut
 ed to a disciple of Jesus named “John”: the Gospel of John and the letters 
 of 1 John\, 2 John\, and 3 John. But what do we know about the origins of t
 hese texts? Who really wrote them? In this lecture\, Méndez argues that the
 se works are a chain of falsely authored works (pseudepigrapha)\, written b
 y multiple pens over several decades. The author of the Gospel invented a d
 isciple of Jesus to serve as the narrator of his text\; the authors of the 
 letters\, in turn\, co-opted this character\, fleshing out so many afterliv
 es for him. This presentation traces this arc\, showing how a single act of
  disguised authorship inspired a new literary tradition and shaped twenty c
 enturies of Christian culture.\n\nHugo Méndez is an Associate Professor of 
 Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\, wher
 e he teaches New Testament and early Christianity. He is the author or co-a
 uthor of four books\, including two written as a Borden Faculty Fellow at t
 he IAH: The Gospel of John: A New History (Oxford\, 2025) and The Epistles 
 of John: Origins\, Authorship\, Purpose (Cambridge\, forthcoming). He is al
 so a frequent contributor to documentaries for History and other media outl
 ets.\n\n \n\nLearn more about the event at the IAH website. See all events 
 in the IAH Fellows Forum series.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Botany by Plant Family: The Key to See
DESCRIPTION:Learning to notice plant family patterns can greatly aid in demystifying the “green wall” of plant species around us. Nearly 350\,000 species of flowering plants are known to global science\, and these species have been grouped into more than 400 flowering plant families. By learning the top 30 plant families growing around you\, you will begin to recognize plants everywhere you go. After an indoor presentation on the major plant families common to the Southeastern U.S.\, ethnobotanist marc williams will reinforce your plant identification skills on a walk in the Gardens to observe family patterns in leaf\, flower and fruit types. Discuss edibility\, medicinality\, craft\, wildlife support and landscape beauty as you gain a more holistic understanding of the major plants comprising Southern U.S. flora and their potential ecological and ethnobotanical applications. \nFee: $32; 20% discount for Duke Gardens members with discount code. \nParking: Fees apply. \nLocation: Onsite at Duke Gardens. Meeting location will be included in a program reminder email sent before the program. \nAccessibility: This will be a small group program that takes place partially seated indoors and partially outdoors traveling on a combination of paved and unpaved paths with some uneven surfaces and moderate inclines.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Research is relying on increasingly complex code. However\, mos
 t academics have not received formal training in software development. This
  course will introduce participants to some of the best practices of profes
 sional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Pyt
 hon code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scri
 pts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for t
 heir functions\, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure
  that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\
 nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record
  package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities an
 d ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the orig
 inal analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control syst
 em. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Git
 hub\, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests ar
 e run each time code is changed.\n\nThe course will primarily consist of a 
 hands-on exercise to restructure a single long analysis file into functions
  and automated tests.\n\n“Version Control with Git and Github” course is a 
 prerequisite for this course.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stude
 nts) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Conversations that take place online – from learning management
  systems to Signal chats to Discord groups to Reddit support groups and Ins
 tagram influencing – can be valuable forms of evidence for qualitative rese
 archers. In this workshop\, participants will create their own research des
 igns to investigate a phenomenon of interest\, as evidenced through social 
 media data\, in a systematic and rigorous way. The Paulus and Wise research
  design decision framework will scaffold learners in how to identify an obj
 ect of interest\; articulate their philosophical and theoretical assumption
 s about how language functions online\; create focused and relevant researc
 h questions\; ensure methodological alignment across aspects of the study d
 esign\; resolve ethical dilemmas around treating social media as data\; ext
 ract and transform social media into a coherent dataset\; select appropriat
 e technologies for managing and analyzing data\; perform a systematic narra
 tive\, discourse and/or thematic analysis\; and establish the quality of th
 e findings. Course material will be drawn from Looking for Learning\, Insig
 ht and Transformation in Online Talk (Paulus & Wise\, Routledge\, 2019).\n\

DESCRIPTION:Research is relying on increasingly complex code. However\, mos
 t academics have not received formal training in software development. This
  course will introduce participants to some of the best practices of profes
 sional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Pyt
 hon code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scri
 pts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for t
 heir functions\, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure
  that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\
 nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record
  package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities an
 d ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the orig
 inal analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control syst
 em. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Git
 hub\, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests ar
 e run each time code is changed.\n\nThe course will primarily consist of a 
 hands-on exercise to restructure a single long analysis file into functions
  and automated tests.\n\n“Version Control with Git and Github” course is a 
 prerequisite for this course.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stude
 nts) are required for Zoom link access.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Join Belle Boggs\, professor in the Department of English at NC

 d of Wyatt Outlaw: From Reconstruction Through Black Lives Matter. Outlaw’s
  story was one of Black success — he was a Union League leader\, business o
 wner and the first Black town constable and commissioner in Graham\, a smal
 l town in North Carolina’s Alamance County. But in 1870\, the Ku Klux Klan 
 murdered Outlaw\, setting off a dramatic series of events. Allen and Boggs 
 both sought to discover why Outlaw had been erased from mainstream history 
 books. In The Legend of Wyatt Outlaw\, they share what they found in artful
  detail and connect Outlaw’s story to the violence against Black people in 
 Alamance and throughout the United States\, from Reconstruction through Jim
  Crow\, the civil rights era and Black Lives Matter.\n\nSource: NC State University

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Mark your calendars for April 25th\, 2025 for the first officia
 l Washington County event in 2026 to commemorate America's 250th anniversar
 y! The America 250 NC Washington County 250th Committee and the Washington 
 County Historical Society at the Daniel Davenport Festival have come togeth
 er to commemorate the lives of Revolutionary War Soldiers.\n\nThere will be
  living history demonstrations\, including ropemaking\, examples of soldier
 s' rations and their equipment\, camp cooking\, and others. Period musician
 s will provide musical performances. Other presentations include medicine d
 uring the American Revolution\, and the Tyrrell County Men who served in th
 e American Revolution\, since Washington County was not officially establis
 hed until 1799.\n\nTours of the main house and its assorted buildings\, whi
 ch illustrate 18th-century life\, including a corn crib\, smokehouse\, and 
 a building for the loom\, have been arranged. The Homestead is on the Natio
 nal Register of Historic Places. It is a rare but fine example of a late 18
 th-century yeoman farmer's dwelling\, and it remains in nearly original con
 dition\, despite the fact that the descendants of Davenport lived in the ho
 use until the mid-1970s without making any modern improvements. A truly uni
 que gem in the region.\n\nThe Sons of the American Revolution are holding a
  recognition and wreath-laying ceremony\, including information about Danie
 l Davenport's six-month service in the NC 5th Regiment and his legacy in Wa
 shington County\, at 2:00 pm. Local school children will sing as part of th
 e ceremony.\n\nPlease note: The celebration festival is free\, but the food
  truck on site is not. In addition\, the Homestead does not have a specific
  address. It is located on Mount Tabor Road in Creswell on the corner of St
 ate Route 1143 and 1146. If coming from the direction of Creswell\, it is o
 n the road to the right after a sharp curve at the Mount Tabor Free Will Ba
 ptist Church. You can also use Google Maps\, Davenport Homestead\, Creswell

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:The problem with most attempts to adopt stress-management or se
 lf-care routines is that they require time\, effort and planning. The reali
 ty for many people who have stressful jobs is that they are too physically 
 exhausted and mentally depleted by the end of the day to initiate activitie
 s commonly recommended to reduce stress in their lives. The trick is to int
 ervene via multiple “micro-moments” of relaxation or mindful practices whic
 h only take 15 to 60 seconds. These moments of relaxation help bring stress
  levels down during the workday and interrupt the steady escalation of stre
 ss that creates physical and mental exhaustion. Also addressed: simple wind
 ing-down routines that can end the day in a calming\, mindful way.\n\n \n\n
 Workshop Objectives\nThis training will help you:\n• Describe how stress es
 calates through the day and leads to exhaustion\n• Consider whether your pr
 esent stress reduction habits may be adding to your overall stress\n• Under
 stand how simple short moments of relaxation throughout the day can permit 
 you reduce stress and\nconserve energy\n• Practice brief mindful moments of
  relaxation and learn how to integrate these moments into your workday\n• U
 nderstand the value of winding-down routines that foster a sense of safety 
 and personal control.\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link an

DESCRIPTION:Take a glance through recent news or social media and you would
  be hard-pressed not to see mentions of chatbots and artificial intelligenc
 e (AI) methods aimed at generating text\, images and other content.  Recent
  work by Eloundou and colleagues (2023) explored the potential impact of th
 ese types of generative AI on labor markets\, and survey research\, specifi
 cally was among the top two most impacted industries.  Professor Andrew Ng 
 has been cited as saying “AI won’t replace human workers\, but ‘people that
  use it will replace people that don’t.’”  Much of the way researchers in t
 he social sciences and survey research are incorporating AI into their work
 flow involves some type of prompting.  Prompt Engineering approaches along 
 with more nuanced fine tuning approaches are being used and refined to bett

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
 si.org/downloads/) .\n\nLearn more at [codewiththecarolinas.org](codeforth

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.\n\nSource: NC State University

DESCRIPTION:Managing individuals who may be struggling with stress\, anxiet
 y\, depression and other mental health concerns can be a difficult balancin
 g act. Your role is to manage performance and to bring out the best in your
  workforce\, but accomplishing this often requires you to express concern a
 nd support when employees struggle emotionally. Managers often feel uncomfo
 rtable in this aspect of their role and may lack the important skills of “e
 motional management.” This course covers ways employees may present their d
 istress and offers insights and strategies on forging supportive empathic a
 lliances within the role of manager. The session also identifies common mis
 takes managers make in responding to employees in distress and explains com
 munication skills that express support and convey positive expectancy. Part
 icipants are also given information on how to refer employees to the Employ
 ee Assistance Program.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nBy the end of this work
 shop\, you will:\n• Understand the universality of mental health issues in 
 the workplace\n• Recognize the most common symptoms of mental illness\n• Id
 entify the most common unhelpful reactions to symptoms\, why they occur and
  how to avoid them\n• Identify ways of expressing compassion and developing
  an alliance with distressed employees\n• Reduce the stigma associated ment
 al illness and promote ways of supporting one another in the workplace\n• R
 ecognize the warning signs of suicide\n• Identify support services and reso
 urces for all leaders and employees\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent regist
 ration link and select the “Request” button to automatically enroll.\n\nSource: UNC Chapel Hill

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i

SUMMARY:Native Plant Solutions: Fall Forward Perennials
DESCRIPTION:Does your landscape look tired near the end of summer? Give yourself and the wildlife around you a boost with fall-forward perennials. At their peak during late summer and fall\, these species have unique charms and an important ecological role. They give pollinators the resources they need before transitioning to the next stage of development. The superstars of autumn\, asters and goldenrods\, are keystone species that lend outsized support to food webs. They and other fall-forward plants extend the season visually and offer a rich tapestry of color and radiance optimized for the changing angle of the sun. Join Shannon Currey\, education and outreach at Izel Native Plants\, to learn more about lighting up your landscape with fall in mind! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.\n\nSource: Sarah P.

DESCRIPTION:For a long time\, the scientific community believed we were bor
 n with a certain number of brain cells and neural pathways and that\, once 
 damaged\, they could not be repaired. In reality\, our brains are much more
  flexible. Depending on our lifestyle\, we can weaken or destroy connection
 s\, or create new\, stronger ones. Engaging regularly in certain behaviors 
 and activities\, like physical exercise\, addressing mental health issues\,
  meditation\, and learning a new language or musical instrument\, support n
 ew wiring and can make existing pathways stronger. Essentially\, we can slo
 w down or somewhat prevent cognitive decline by doing challenging mental ex
 ercises to keep our brains fit for optimal power.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectiv
 es\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be able to:\nIdentify traits of 
 a healthy brain:\n• The ability to learn new skills\n• Judgment and intuiti
 on\n• Memory and perception\nIdentify barriers to good brain health:\n• Dep
 ression\n• Chronic stress\n• Unhealthy lifestyle\nIdentify methods for opti
 mal cognitive health:\n• Engaging in new skills and mentally challenging ac
 tivities\n• Meditation\n• Physical exercise\n• Brain training\n\n \n\nClick

DESCRIPTION:Your body responds to the way you think\, feel and act. This is
  often called the “mind/body connection.” When you are stressed\, anxious o
 r upset\, your body tries to tell you that something isn’t right. For examp
 le\, high blood pressure might develop after a particularly stressful event
 \, such as the death of a loved one. People with good emotional health are 
 aware of their thoughts\, feelings and behaviors. They have learned healthy
  ways to cope with the stress and problems that are a normal part of life. 
 They feel good about themselves and have healthy relationships. Poor emotio
 nal health can weaken your body’s immune system\, making you more likely to
  get colds and other infections during emotionally difficult times. Also\, 
 when you are feeling stressed\, anxious or upset\, you may not take care of
  your health as well as you should. You may not feel like exercising\, eati
 ng nutritious foods or taking medicine that your doctor prescribes. Abuse o
 f alcohol\, tobacco or other drugs may also be a sign of poor emotional hea
 lth.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be
  able to:\nIdentify the relationship between mind and body\n• Describe how 
 the body influences emotional and mental functioning\n• Describe how our em
 otions\, beliefs and self talk impact our body\n• Identify symptoms of a po
 ssible mind/body disconnection\nIdentify ways to enhance the mind/body conn
 ection\n• Describe methods for achieving balance in life\n• Identify ways t
 o express feelings appropriately\n• Describe the importance of taking care 
 of your health\n• Describe ways to enhance awareness\nIdentify your persona
 l action plan for mind/body connection\n• Recognize the importance of consu
 lting with your physician\n• Describe which mind/body tools need to develop
 \n• List outside resources for further help\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talen

 l assistants a “plaque.”\n\nFind out the Tooth\, the Whole Tooth\, and noth
 ing by the Tooth on how our founding fathers took care of their oral hygien
 e and why we should be happy to have the dentists of today.\n\nThis event i

DESCRIPTION:Join us at The Park at Seven Devils for some backyard birding! 
 Birding is an activity that can be done by anyone at any age. Most birders 
 start out by identifying common birds found at their backyard bird feeders.
  During this workshop you will learn how to point out key characteristics\,
  such as size\, coloration\, and activity\, that can help you identify comm
 on backyard bird species\, specifically species that visit bird feeders. By
  using applications like Audubon and Merlin\, along with identification gui
 des\, you will be able to use those key characteristics to help you identif
 y common species found here in the High Country. Binoculars are not require
 d\, but highly recommended\, and there will be a quick lesson on how to pro
 perly use binoculars. This is a Ranger Workshop with The Town of Seven Devi
 ls.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:*Save the Date* More Details Coming Soon! The New Bern Resolves
  constitute a significant chapter in the history of the American Revolution
 \, reflecting the growing discontent of the colonies with British rule and 
 their bold steps toward self-governance. Adopted on August 27\, 1774\, by 7
 1 elected NC delegates to the First Provincial Congress in America\, the Ne
 w Bern Resolves represented an early\, decisive expression of resistance to
  British policies and "The Intolerable Acts" (Boston Port/Trade Act\, Massa
 chusetts Government Act\, Administration of Justice Act\, and Quartering Ac
 ts) by calling for economic sanctions against Great Britain and its trading
  partners. As one of the earliest documented calls for solidarity among the
  colonies\, the New Bern Resolves laid the groundwork for broader revolutio
 nary movements.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

DESCRIPTION:Harriet Ann Daves recalled just how monumental Civil War surren
 ders were for her family: "When the surrender came my grandfather came to m
 y mother and told her: 'Well\, you are as free as I am.'"\n\nClaiming freed
 om was not so straightforward for the 331\,059 enslaved women\, children\, 
 and men during the Civil War. Some took enormous risk to reach Union lines 
 before the federal government made any promise of abolishing slavery. Other
 s left their homes and plantations to follow Sherman's army as they marched
  through the southeast. Some believed home was where they already lived and
  worked and waited patiently for freedom to extend to them. Others still we
 re lied to by their enslavers or moved away from the advancing U.S. Army so
  they would remain enslaved. Freedom came in different ways and at differen
 t times to enslaved people across the state.\n\nOne common thread unites th
 ese freedom stories: the defeat of the Confederate military ensured a new b
 irth of freedom across the state and nation.\n\nDuring this special luminar
 y program\, Bennett Place invites you to reflect on the end of the Civil Wa
 r as a momentous step towards freedom for all Americans and the end of chat
 tel slavery in the United States. Walk among 3\,310 luminaries - one for ev
 ery 1\,000 enslaved people in North Carolina - and reflect on experiences o
 f enslavement and freedom. Historians dot the path and share stories of peo
 ple's pathways to freedom and life after slavery & the Civil War.\n\nSource: NC Cultural Resources

 the science behind dye production. Visitors will have a chance to view and 
 work an active fermentation vat\, and dyeing demonstrations will occur thro
