DESCRIPTION:Mother: Give birth to\n\nBeing a mother encompasses healing\, c
 hange\, and understanding. The goal of our fashion show\, “MOTHERing\,” ack
 nowledges the power of the title in a literal sense\, as well as embracing 
 the metaphorical use of the term\, as it has made its way into the queer co
 mmunity and has been sustained for years. Now\, more than ever\, we must am
 plify the voices empowered by queerness and demonstrate the amount of care\
 , thoughtfulness\, and acceptance that has been shared by the LGBTQ+ commun
 ity. This show will be a celebration of drag culture\, honoring a famous mo
 ther\, designer\, ballroom performer & New York native\, Dorian Corey\, for
  their contributions to the attitude in the ballroom space. We will open ou
 r space for showing more than telling\, to display the glorious craftsmansh
 ip\, creative quality and exuberant energy that is projected and protected 
 by drag. The Xpressions production will showcase two parts: traditional dra
 g and modern camp\, offering something equally visually compelling and hyst
 erical.

DESCRIPTION:The process of manifesting success in life isn’t about “good vi
 bes” or otherworldly approaches. Instead\, manifesting is firmly rooted in 
 neuroscience with decades of research to back-up the life-changing results.
  This session explores how intention setting and repetition can literally r
 ewire the brain—embedding aspirations at a deep\, subconscious level so tha
 t your mind naturally tunes into opportunities aligned with your goals. Gui
 ded by research-backed neuroscience\, this session emphasizes crafting inte
 ntions grounded in compassion and calm rather than stress or external valid
 ation\, thus priming your brain’s task positive networks to support meaning
 ful\, lasting progress.\n\nWorkshop Objectives:\n\n• Explain the neuroscien
 ce principles that underlie the process of manifesting success\, including 
 how intention setting and repetition influence neural pathways\n• Identify 
 the key brain networks involved in goal-directed behavior and how they resp
 ond to intentional\, compassionate focus versus stress-based motivation\n• 
 Apply evidence-based intention-setting techniques to align subconscious pro
 cessing with conscious goals\n• Develop personalized manifestation practice
 s that integrate calm\, compassion\, and focus to rewire the brain for succ
 ess\n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Request”

DESCRIPTION:Dr. Daniela R. P. Weiner will discuss her book\, Teaching a Dar
 k Chapter: History Books and the Holocaust in Italy and the Germanys\, whic
 h was recently published by Cornell University Press. In Teaching a Dark Ch
 apter\, Dr. Weiner examines how the post-fascist countries of Italy\, East 
 Germany and West Germany taught about fascism and the Holocaust in their sc
 hools\, looking particularly at these events’ depictions in school history 
 textbooks. Teaching a Dark Chapter challenges traditional narratives about 
 the development of European Holocaust memory and demonstrates that long bef
 ore the 1968 student revolts\, education played a significant role in influ
 encing public memory about Nazi/Fascist atrocities.

DESCRIPTION:This course is the first is a two-part scale development course
  series that introduces students to the systematic process of developing mu
 lti-item scale measures and survey instruments. Examples include measures o
 f various social and psychological variables that might be assessed in heal
 th\, medicine\, journalism\, or other related research areas. After a brief
  theoretical introduction to topics such as defining a construct and types 
 of validity\, we will turn to applied issues such as what is the optimal sc
 ale development process and how (and when) can you deviate from that proces
 s. We will also address practical issues around questionnaire design such a
 s how to construct a “good” survey instrument that has a natural flow\, min
 imizes participant burden\, has appropriate response options and other comm
 on concerns in scale development and design. We will focus on real-life exa
 mples to demonstrate the scale development process. Although we will briefl
 y discuss the kinds of quantitative techniques that are commonly used in th
 e scale development process\, this course will not cover the application of
  these methods. Quantitative methods for scale development will be covered 
 in Part 2 of this course series (separate registration is required).\n\nReg
 istration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link acce

DESCRIPTION:Implementing discipline over our emotional life is difficult an
 d requires lifelong practice. Being able to choose to act or respond in a p
 articular manner is preferable to re-acting on a consistent basis\, yet it 
 is difficult. Enhancing emotional intelligence improves our ability to mast
 er our emotional functioning. High emotional intelligence can improve our c
 ommunications with all others\, enhance our perception of satisfaction with
  ourselves and our lives and increase our productiveness overall.\n\n \n\nW
 orkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be able to:\nDes
 cribe the difference between intelligence and emotional intelligence\n• Des
 cribe the benefits of having emotional intelligence\n• Describe the compone
 nts of emotional intelligence\n• Identify the function and qualities of emo
 tions\n• Identify ways of assessing your emotional intelligence\nDescribe s
 trategies for improving emotional intelligence\n• Describe how to improve y
 our capacity for emotional self-control through mindfulness meditation\, mo
 nitoring\nself-statements and active listening\n• Describe how to accept re
 sponsibility for emotions and ways to teach emotional intelligence to child
 ren.\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link and select the “Req

DESCRIPTION:Killing bacteria by leveraging phage-derived peptide antibiotic
 s\n\nA Colloquium and program that brings undergraduate students from local
  historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the Triangle area 
 to the Slayton Evans Memorial Lecture\n\n\nBil Clemons\nCalifornia Tech\n\n
 A catered lunch for colloquium attendees only will be served from 11:30 to 
 12:30 pm in the Stone Center.\nBio\n\nProfessor Bil Clemons received his Ph
 D from the University of Utah working under Prof. Venki Ramakrishnan. Durin
 g this time he spent two years as a visiting scientist at the Laboratory of
  Molecular Biology in Cambridge\, England. The most notable achievement dur
 ing his graduate work was that he was part of the team that solved the firs
 t atomic resolution structure of a small ribosomal subunit. This work led t
 o a fundamental understanding of the translation of the genetic code and pr
 ovided molecular details of the mechanism of a number of antibiotics. He th
 en took a post-doctoral position at Harvard Medical School working for Prof
 s. Tom Rapoport and Steve Harrison. During this time he solved the structur
 e of the ubiquitous protein translocation channel. This membrane protein st
 ructure allowed for a clear model of how this fundamentally important compl
 ex could perform its unique function. Arriving at Caltech in 2006\, the Cle
 mons lab has continued its focus on structurally characterizing important b
 iological systems.\nAbstract\n\nA vital step in the bacteriophage life cycl
 e is the need to breach the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall.
  Although various lysis mechanisms have evolved\, the simplest ones are fou
 nd in single-stranded DNA or RNA bacteriophages\, which\, due to their smal
 l genomes\, encode a single-gene lysis (Sgl) protein. In this talk\, I will
  discuss how we use single-particle electron cryo-microscopy to determine s
 tructures of these Sgls bound to their targets\, including the essential en
 zyme MraY and the flippase MurJ. I will explain how these structures have i
 nspired both mechanistic understanding and our efforts to develop new small
 -molecule inhibitors.

  and a local network of landowners\, merchants\, and guides\, made an impor
 tant collection of vertebrate fossils in South America during the voyage of
  HMS Beagle (1831-1836). At first\, Darwin doubted the usefulness of his fo
 ssils. Eventually\, however\, these specimens would prove to be the most sa
 tisfying as well as one of the most scientifically significant collections 
 Darwin made during the voyage. This presentation will explore Darwin's brie
 f dalliance with vertebrate paleontology.\n\n \n\nAbout the Speaker\n\n \n\
 nPaul D. Brinkman is a museum curator with overlapping interests in the sci
 ences and the humanities. He graduated from Augustana College with a B.A. d
 egree in history and a minor in geology. In 2005\, he completed a Ph.D. in 
 history of science at the University of Minnesota. A bibliophile and an avi
 d traveler\, he is equally at home in the library or in the field. His rese
 arch interest is in history of nineteenth-century natural sciences\, especi
 ally geology and paleontology. He has published a number of articles on Cha
 rles Darwin\, on museum history\, and on history of American vertebrate pal
 eontology. His latest book\, Now is the Time to Collect: Daniel Elliot\, Ca
 rl Akeley\, & the Field Columbian Museum Zoological Expedition to Africa in
  1896\, was published by the University of Alabama Press in 2024. He works 
 at the N. C. Museum of Natural Sciences and teaches part-time in the Histor
 y Department at N. C. State University.

DESCRIPTION:On February 13\, art and art history professor Maggie Cao (FFP 
 ’19) will give a lecture. The lecture is titled "Diurnal Medium: Early Phot
 ography in the Arctic."\n\nBuilding on research from her recently published
  book\, Painting US Empire: Nineteenth-Century Art and its Legacies\, which
  examines Arctic landscapes in one of its chapters\, Cao turns to another m
 edium used to depict Arctic expeditions: photography. British and American 
 explorers brought cameras to the Arctic soon after photography’s invention 
 in 1839 despite the requirement of traveling with cumbersome cameras\, vola
 tile chemicals\, and portable dark rooms. Light\, for capturing the image\,
  and darkness\, for developing it\, were essential conditions of photograph
 y\, making it a “diurnal” medium unlike other forms of representation. This
  talk considers the conundrum of making “sun pictures” (a period term for p
 hotography) of such phenomena as the midnight sun and perpetual night in a 
 geographical space beyond diurnal temporality.\n\nMaggie Cao is a scholar o
 f eighteenth and nineteenth-century American art in a global context. At UN
 C\, she teaches the history of American art from the colonial period to the
  twentieth century as well as courses on the visual histories of science an
 d economics. She is the author of two books: The End of Landscape in Ninete
 enth-Century America (University of California Press\, 2018)\, which examin
 es the dissolution of landscape painting as a major cultural project in the
  late nineteenth-century United States\, and Painting US Empire: Nineteenth
 -Century Art and its Legacies (Chicago University Press\, 2025)\, the first
  synthetic treatment of nineteenth-century art and empire in the global con
 text. Professor Cao is currently engaged in research on nineteenth-century 
 artistic engagements with ecological temporalities—the nonhuman time preser
 ved in tree rings\, ice cores\, and rock strata. Professor Cao received her
  doctorate in art history from Harvard University in 2014 and did postdocto
 ral work at Columbia University’s Society of Fellows before coming to UNC i
 n 2016. She has received fellowships for her research from the National Hum
 anities Center\, the Terra Foundation\, and the Smithsonian\, and the Getty
  Research Institute.\n\n \n\nSee all events in the IAH Fellows Forum series

DESCRIPTION:There is a certain type of person who not only accepts the chal
 lenges of working in a high stress emotional environment but also excels de
 spite the demands. Whether they are working with individuals who are experi
 encing trauma\, grief\, loss\, illness or other stressful concerns the peop
 le whose role it is to help others in distress are often perceived as dedic
 ated\, hardworking\, selfless and compassionate. Nevertheless\, it is often
  those whose mission it is to help others who may be at increased risk of n
 eglecting their own self-care. This training will raise awareness of the ne
 ed to maintain appropriate self-care despite the demands of work and/or the
  pressures of home life. The course will offer specific tips to encourage s
 elf-care in order to maintain high level of functioning both personally and
  professionally.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives:\n\nAt the end of this worksho
 p\, you will be able to:\n• Describe how helping others in need can lead to
  potential self-neglect\n• Understand the importance of self-care in workin
 g with an emotionally stressed population\n• Understand how to perform a se
 lf-care assessment\n• Describe to best strategies for implementing self-car
 e strategies\n• Identify resources available for continued self-care succes

DESCRIPTION:This interactive\, hands-on workshop will introduce participant
 s to a research design framework for considering the use of generative AI i
 n qualitative research designs and workflows (Paulus & Lester\, 2024).\nWe 
 will start by acknowledging inherent risks and ethical dilemmas posed by th
 e development of large language models and how generative AI is challenging
  the essence of what it means to do qualitative work (Paulus & Marone\, 202
 5\; Paulus\, Lester & Davis\, 2025). We will learn how to distinguish betwe
 en methodological strategies and technological tactics\, i.e. why researche
 rs must first know how they want to work with their data before choosing th
 e best tools to do so. We will then discuss the current ‘state of play’ reg
 arding the various genres of AI-assist technologies available to qualitativ
 e researchers and how to select the most appropriate platform. We will then
  design and implement an “AI-assisted workflow” for managing and analyzing 
 data using MAXQDA. Finally\, we will discuss best practices for how to repo
 rt the use of AI in research studies (Lester & Paulus\, forthcoming) and ho
 w to reflexively consider the consequences of doing so.\nSample interview d
 ata will be used for the practice exercises with discussion around the use 
 of other types of qualitative data. Workshop time will alternate between sh
 ort lectures and demonstrations\, small group discussions\, practical hands
 -on activities\, and application of principles learned to the participants’
  own research studies and data.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for stu
 dents) are required for Zoom link access.

DESCRIPTION:The Scottsboro Trials stand as one of the most renowned miscarr
 iages of justice in the history of American jurisprudence. Beginning in 193
 1 with a false accusation of rape against nine Black teenagers\, the case w
 ent on to invigorate a nascent Civil Rights movement\, earn the internation
 al support of the Communist Party\, and establish itself as a watchword amo
 ng various strands of the American Left. It inspired reaction from the cont
 emporary world of arts and letters as well. The international\, politically
 -oriented Yiddish intelligentsia of the thirties was galvanized\, producing
  a body of creative response that passionately took up the themes of the tr
 ial\, juxtaposing its American injustices with a diversity of images\, trop
 es and language imbued with their own distinct histories of oppression.\n\n
  \n\nThis concert-lecture features Professor Amelia Glaser\, UC San Diego\,
  and musicians Heather Klein\, Anthony Russell\, and Uri Schreter\, perform
 ing their new settings of Yiddish and English poetry written in response to
  the pervasive climate of race prejudice that gave birth to the Scottsboro 
 trials—and other injustices to come.

 tion.\n\n \n\nMore than a performance\, Indivisible is an experience. Dr. S

 rgettable stories that span generations. With an exceptional ability to con

 courageous space – one that encourages honest engagement with difficult tru
 ths\, exploration of shared humanity\, and the pursuit of healing and unity

  in America today.Engages both heart and mind\, blending scholarship with p
 owerful live performance.Inspires hope\, resilience\, and connection across
  generations and communities.Creates a welcoming space for thoughtful commu
 nity conversation.Join us for an insightful\, moving\, and inspiring Black

DESCRIPTION:In this course\, participants will learn how to keep track of t
 he code they use in their research using the version control system Git and
  the collaboration platform GitHub. Git allows you to keep track of changes
  to your code\, easily revert to previous versions\, and “tag” versions of 
 code used in publications so that the exact code used can be retrieved at a
  later date. GitHub allows Git users to collaborate with each other on proj
 ects by managing simultaneous changes to the same files and allowing users 
 to review and discuss each others’ code. Git and Github are applicable to a
 ny text-based programming or analysis language\, including R\, Python\, Sta
 ta\, Julia\, and others.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the “Modular 
 Design and Automated Testing with R” course in April.

DESCRIPTION:Set during a modest holiday at a Turkish resort in the early 20
 00s\, Aftersun approaches coming of age obliquely\, through memory and retr
 ospection. Stunningly shot on 35mm film\, which is contrasted with mini DV 
 home movie video footage\, the plot follows young Sophie (Frankie Corio) an
 d her father Calum (Paul Mescal). But it is the adult Sophie’s somber attem
 pt to reconstruct this formative trip that gives the story its emotional ch
 arge. Coming of age here is not marked by clear lessons or dramatic turning
  points\, but by the gradual\, dawning recognition of a parent’s fragility—
 and of the limits of childhood understanding. \n  \nThe film will be introd
 uced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor a
 nd Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. 
 at the Chelsea Theater\, 1129 Weaver Dairy Road\, Suite AB\, Chapel Hill\, 
 NC 27514. Click here for more information on theater pricing\; tickets are 
 free for UNC-Chapel Hill students. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE
  credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the
  Series:\nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking 
 Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boy
 s Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience b
 y using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum 
 is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in 
 the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.

DESCRIPTION:This interactive workshop will guide participants through effec
 tive and respectful approaches to tribal community engagement\, drawing on 
 real case studies from ongoing work with American Indian communities across
  North Carolina. Led by staff from the UNC American Indian Center and partn
 ers working in tribal health settings\, the session will highlight strategi
 es that build trust\, honor sovereignty\, and support sustainable health ou
 tcomes. Using examples from projects such as the Healthy Native North Carol
 inians Network (HNNC)\, the Southeastern American Indian Cancer Health Equi
 ty Partnership (SAICEP)\, and the new pilot initiative to strengthen tribal
  health infrastructure in the state\, facilitators will demonstrate what me
 aningful engagement looks like in practice. The workshop will also address 
 common challenges encountered in cross-cultural public health work\, includ
 ing navigating historical contexts\, aligning institutional goals with comm
 unity priorities\, and supporting Indigenous leadership. Attendees will lea
 ve with practical tools\, relationship-building techniques\, and a deeper u
 nderstanding of how universities and organizations can partner ethically an
 d effectively with tribal nations. By centering lived experience and real-w
 orld examples\, this workshop invites participants to reflect\, learn\, and
  strengthen their own approaches to community-engaged work with American In
 dian communities.\n\nPresenters:\n\nRyan Dial\, American Indian Health\, Pr

DESCRIPTION:W. Fitzhugh Brundage\, William B. Umstead Distinguished Profess
 or of History\, will discuss his new book\, "A Fate Worse than Hell: Americ
 an Prisoners of the Civil War\," on Tuesday\, Feb. 24 at 6 p.m. at Flyleaf 
 Books in Chapel Hill. A book-signing at 5:30 p.m. will precede the event.\n
 \n \n\nIt is newly estimated that 750\,000 soldiers died in the American Ci
 vil War. But less well-known than the war’s death toll are the roughly 400\
 ,000 Union and Confederate troops who were captured and imprisoned. Many PO
 Ws died from starvation\, dysentery\, and exposure\, and at the worst of th
 e prison pens\, more than 30\,000 soldiers were caged in the equivalent of 
 ten city block. "Fate Worse than Hell" contemplates the roots and consequen
 ces of this mass incarceration from America’s bloodiest conflict.\n\n \n\nB
 rundage will discuss the book with David Blight\, Sterling Professor of His
 tory at Yale University.\n\n \n\nRegister at the Flyleaf Books link.

DESCRIPTION:Human bodies are composed of complex physiological architecture
  to support survival\, including a beating heart and a dynamic immune syste
 m. This same architecture also undergirds our everyday emotional lives\, af
 fecting how we infer each other’s emotional states and sense that our feeli
 ngs are “shared” in a given moment. In this talk\, Dr. Mallory Feldman will
  share the science of the body’s role in emotional experience\, and Dr. Cat
 herine Berman will discuss when and how co-experienced emotions (particular
 ly positive emotions) may shape well-being\, including in fleeting social i
 nteractions. Join us on Tuesday\, February 24\, from 6:00 to 7:00 PM at the

DESCRIPTION:Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith incr
 eased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come inc
 reased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within indi
 viduals. Additionally\, technological advances have made the collection of 
 person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interes
 ted in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day cours
 e focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions
  concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individ
 uals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time s
 eries data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily
  diary data\; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary s
 ampling (ESM)\; passive data from cell phones\; and other psychophysiologic
 al data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling fr
 ameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterati
 ve Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore pr
 ocesses as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-speci
 fic network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network
  models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks
  will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between meth
 ods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during th
 is course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series
  analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues
  with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFit
 ting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches fo
 r summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course
  is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling fram
 eworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples 
 with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to gi
 ve learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\
 nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link 
 access.

DESCRIPTION:In this course\, participants will learn how to keep track of t
 he code they use in their research using the version control system Git and
  the collaboration platform GitHub. Git allows you to keep track of changes
  to your code\, easily revert to previous versions\, and “tag” versions of 
 code used in publications so that the exact code used can be retrieved at a
  later date. GitHub allows Git users to collaborate with each other on proj
 ects by managing simultaneous changes to the same files and allowing users 
 to review and discuss each others’ code. Git and Github are applicable to a
 ny text-based programming or analysis language\, including R\, Python\, Sta
 ta\, Julia\, and others.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the “Modular 
 Design and Automated Testing with R” course in April.

DESCRIPTION:Department of Art and Art History\n\n \n\n“Like the Dawn of Cre
 ation: Byzantine Fragments in the Modern Imagination”\n\n \n\nThis talk exp
 lores how Byzantium operates as a queer cipher in modern culture\, appearin
 g as an adjectival modifier\, “the Byzantine\,” rather than as a distinct h
 istorical referent. Analyzing Gore Vidal’s 1959 adaptation of Tennessee Wil
 liams’s Suddenly\, Last Summer\, Betancourt demonstrates how Byzantine refe
 rences encode queer identity through the film’s absent protagonist\, whose 
 unspeakable sexuality mirrors Byzantium’s own unintelligibility. Drawing on
  extensive archival research\, he shows how “the Byzantine” articulated cod
 ed queerness for these writers and artists. This talk proposes reimagining 
 Byzantine art history through modes of “queer fragmentation\,” recognizing 
 Byzantine elements across temporal boundaries.\n\n \n\nRoland Betancourt is
  a scholar of Byzantium and modern popular culture with research that lies 
 firmly at the intersection of the history of science and technology\, intel
 lectual history\, and the history of art. Dr. Betancourt is the Andrew W. M
 ellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the 
 National Gallery of Art in Washington\, DC from 2024-2026. He also holds th
 e honor of Chancellor’s Professor\, Department of Art History\, at the Univ
 ersity of California\, Irvine. He is also the author of four monographs\, i
 ncluding The Secrets We Keep: Hidden Histories of the Byzantine Empire (The
  Getty\, 2024)\, Performing the Gospels in Byzantium: Sight\, Sound\, and S
 pace in the Divine Liturgy (Cambridge University Press\, 2021)\, Byzantine 
 Intersectionality: Sexuality\, Gender\, and Race in the Middle Ages (Prince
 ton University Press\, 2020)\, and Sight\, Touch\, and Imagination in Byzan
 tium (Cambridge University Press\, 2018). Betancourt’s forthcoming book\, D
 isneyland and the Rise of Automation: How Technology Created the Happiest P
 lace on Earth (Princeton University Press\, 2026)\, traces the origins and 
 evolution of the theme park’s technical innovations during Disneyland’s fir

DESCRIPTION:Knowing how to develop various types of qualitative research st
 udies to respond to complex research and community priorities is rewarding\
 , but can also be daunting. This short course provides practical skills for
  conducting various types of qualitative research in U.S. and international
  settings. First\, students will learn about the epistemological and theore
 tical foundations of qualitative research and the range of methodologies cu
 rrently used such as programmatic qualitative research\, ethnography\, grou
 nded theory\, phenomenology\, and case studies. Next\, the short course pro
 vides step-by-step instructions on how to develop and implement various qua
 litative methods and designs\, such as interviews\, focus groups\, and obse
 rvations – and how to handle single- versus multi-method qualitative studie
 s or cross-sectional versus longitudinal qualitative studies. Students will
  learn basic principles for data generation\, ethics\, and data quality in 
 qualitative studies. We will also focus on practical steps for data analysi
 s\, including data management\, transcription\, and coding. Traditionally\,
  qualitative research is conducted in-person\, and students will be trained
  for in-person interactions. However\, the short course’s concluding module
  teaches students about techniques required for contemporary qualitative re
 search online and by phone\, including consideration of recent advances in 
 conducting qualitative research using social media. This course is designed
  to provide new knowledge for both introductory and intermediate students. 
 Registration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link a

DESCRIPTION:Grief is often linked to death\, but many of life’s losses are 
 quieter and less visible—changes in identity\, shifting roles\, unmet expec
 tations\, and transitions that leave lasting marks. Led jointly by a facult

 d human experience\, drawing on research-based insights alongside reflectiv
 e and compassionate practices. Participants will examine how grief shapes i
 dentity\, relationships\, and sense of purpose\, while learning practical w
 ays to navigate loss in their own lives. The session will also consider how
  individuals and communities can create space for grief in supportive\, mea
 ningful ways. Participants will leave with concrete tools for honoring loss
 \, fostering resilience\, and sustaining compassion and continuity through

 luences identity\, relationships\, and sense of purpose\, while considering
  how individuals can honor what has been lost while remaining open to growt
 h and change. You will leave with a deeper understanding of grief as a shar
 ed human experience—and with approaches for fostering compassion\, resilien

DESCRIPTION:The Abbey Speaker Series marks the 250th anniversary of America
 n independence with a discussion of Race and the American Founding at 5:30p
 m on Thursday\, February 26 in the Frank Porter Graham Student Union Audito
 rium.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence proclaimed equality —”all men are 
 created equal”—but the Constitution tolerated slavery. Abolitionists\, Abra
 ham Lincoln\, and civil rights leaders later wielded the Declaration’s word
 s\, but its principal author\, Thomas Jefferson\, owned slaves\, and the De
 claration refers to Native Americans as “merciless savages.” How should we 
 think about this founding paradox that has haunted the nation for 250 years
 ? Historian Annette Gordon-Reed and political theorist Lucas Morel will exp
 lore these and related issues in a discussion moderated by Carolina Public 
 Humanities Executive Director Max Owre.\n\nStudents who attend in person ca
 n earn CLE credit. No tickets necessary\; seating is first-come\, first-ser
 ved. Reserved tickets are available for guests coming from outside Chapel H
 ill\; email publicdiscourse@unc.edu to reserve seats.\n\nJoin us for pizza 
 in the lobby afterward!

DESCRIPTION:How can one neighborhood help strengthen an entire community’s 
 food security? This session invites participants into “planting seeds of su
 pport\,” showing how simple\, neighbor-led action can address hunger in Nor
 th Carolina and beyond. Through storytelling\, local data\, and examples fr
 om current PORCH chapters\, attendees will explore how small\, consistent e
 fforts grow into sustained support for local food pantries. The session con
 cludes with an interactive call to action where attendees receive a digital
  toolkit and learn how to share resources in their own hometowns or network
 s to inspire new neighborhood-led solutions. Leave equipped to spark commun
 ity engagement and help plant the next “seed” where it’s needed most.\n\n \

DESCRIPTION:This is a three-part\, hands-on GIS course. No previous GIS exp
 erience is required. The first session on Monday will be a general overview
  and introduction to the benefits of Open Source GIS in general\, to QGIS i
 n specific\, and will include our first hands-on session with QGIS. Topics 
 to be covered include: the QGIS user interface\, loading vector and raster 
 files\, QGIS plug-ins\, web mapping functions\, QGIS data manipulation\, ic
 ons and pull-down tools\, basic data manipulation\, working with attribute 
 tables\, and general familiarity with QGIS. \n\nPart 2 on Wednesday will co
 ntinue our work with QGIS\, including using the vector\, raster\, and web a
 nalysis functions\, using the print composer.  We will also cover the QGIS 
 website\, tutorials\, listserv\, discussion groups\, sources of help\, etc.
  \n\nPart 3 on Friday will focus on the GRASS GIS and other advanced tools 
 available through the QGIS Processing Toolbox within the QGIS interface. To
 pics covered will include the GRASS vector and raster data formats\, GRASS 
 vector\, raster\, and imagery analysis\, GRASS 3-D data (voxels)\, the rast
 er map calculator\, the print composer\, and other GRASS capabilities. You 
 can attend just the first\, first two\, or all dates.\n\n \n\nLaptops are r
 equired for this course\, no computers are in the room. Students should dow
 nload QGIS (www.qgis.org) before the class\, and will download the sample d
 ata and tutorials (QGIS includes a current version of GRASS) at the start o
 f the class. QGIS runs on Windows\, Mac\, and Linux systems. At the end of 
 the course\, students will have a general ability to use QGIS and GRASS\, a

DESCRIPTION:Ever looked at your utility bill and thought… what does any of 
 this even mean?\n\nJoin us for an interactive session designed to help resi
 dents better understand the energy information on their utility bills. In t
 his workshop\, we move beyond traditional presentations and engage particip
 ants in creative\, hands-on activities.\n\nThrough guided prompts and small
 -group sketching\, you will explore new ways to visualize and communicate e
 nergy data in ways that are simple and relatable. Our goal is to make utili
 ty bills less confusing and empower residents with knowledge they can use i
 n everyday life. No design or technical experience required\, just curiosit
 y and an interest in understanding your energy use.\n\nPresenters:\n\nRache

DESCRIPTION:Using network models to understand human processes\n\nWith incr
 eased interest in person-centered interventions and treatments has come inc
 reased interest in understanding human processes as they unfold within indi
 viduals. Additionally\, technological advances have made the collection of 
 person-specific data easier and more cost-effective for researchers interes
 ted in studying human behavior within everyday contexts. This two-day cours
 e focuses on using two popular network models to explore research questions
  concerning within-person processes.\n\nThis course is intended for individ
 uals with research questions that can be answered using multivariate time s
 eries data/intensive longitudinal data. Examples of such data include daily
  diary data\; data collected via self-report through ecological momentary s
 ampling (ESM)\; passive data from cell phones\; and other psychophysiologic
 al data such as MRI data or heart rate data.\n\nThe two network modeling fr
 ameworks presented in this course are graphicalVAR (GVAR) and Group Iterati
 ve Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME). Both models can be used to explore pr
 ocesses as they unfold within individuals to obtain individual person-speci
 fic network models (idiographic analysis) or group/population level network
  models (nomothetic analysis).  Differences between the modeling frameworks
  will be presented. Challenges and considerations for choosing between meth
 ods will be discussed.\n\nStatistical models and topics presented during th
 is course include the following:\n\nVector autoregression (VAR) time series
  analysis in both non-SEM and SEM frameworksMultilevel Modeling (MLM)Issues
  with aggregating data when trying to understand within-person processesFit
 ting of network models using graphicalVAR and GIMME approachesApproaches fo
 r summarizing idiographic results using meta-analytic techniquesThis course
  is applied in nature and offers a conceptual overview of the modeling fram
 eworks as well as the technical details needed to fit the models. Examples 
 with hands on learning will be provided throughout the two-day course to gi
 ve learners the opportunity to practice fitting and interpreting models.\n\
 nRegistration and fee (refundable for students) are required for Zoom link 
 access.

 y’re rarely thinking about us. How do we bridge that gap to engage communit
 ies effectively?\n\nThis interactive session helps participants step outsid
 e the Chapel Hill bubble to craft messaging that resonates statewide. Using
  the Zietlow Fellowship as an example\, we’ll explore UNC’s role as one par
 tner among many while workshopping clear\, compelling pitches for both comm
 unity audiences and potential funders. You’ll leave with practical tools to
  tell your story authentically\, build trust beyond campus\, and demonstrat
 e impact that matters across North Carolina.\n\nPresenters:\n\nMeridith Whi

DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North

 resentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general au
 dience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to say
  that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essent
 ially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However
 \, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, mea
 ning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachro
 nistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachron
 ic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\,
  adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameter
 s of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this symposi
 um considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdiscipli
 nary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented 
 across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to 
 interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how 
 alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to t
 his inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with tempor
 ality to construct new and alternative histories\; how meaning and interpre
 tation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own sc
 holarly and curatorial practices\; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt a
 nd complicate traditional art historical methods.

DESCRIPTION:Stéphane Gerson will deliver the Institute for the Arts and Hum
 anities Mary Stevens Reckford Memorial Lecture in European Studies on March
  5\, 2026.\n\n \n\nGerson\, a professor at New York University will recount
  his research into personal family history in a lecture titled\, “The Polit
 ics of Our Family Stories: Brussels\, 1994 - Nice\, 1942.”\n\nAs growing nu
 mbers of scholars write personal family histories\, this talk will reckon w
 ith the politics of this genre. How do we turn family stories into historic
 al objects\, open to their manifold dimensions and politics? How do we both
  honor and resist their narrative frameworks\, their silences and absences?
  Stéphane Gerson will address these questions by revisiting the story his g
 randmother Zosia told about her survival in Nazi-occupied Belgium and Franc
 e. Having heard this story as a child\, having videotaped it as a graduate 
 student (in 1994)\, he is now writing a historical ethnography of this wart
 ime adventure\, attuned to the multiple lives\, the multiple relationships 
 that unfold in its recesses. Which raises a final question: How\, beyond bi
 ological filiation but attuned to kinship\, do we write strangers as well a
 s relatives into existence?\n\n \n\nGerson is a professor of French\, Frenc
 h studies\, and history at New York University\, where he directed the Inst
 itute of French Studies for several years. His current research revolves ar
 ound personal family history and modes of historical writing\, especially a
 s it pertains to the Holocaust in Belgium and France. He recently edited an
  essay collection\, Scholars and Their Kin: Historical Explorations\, Liter
 ary Experiments (Chicago\, 2025) and is writing a historical ethnography of
  a family story: Les gestes de notre guerre\, 1994-1942 (La Découverte\, fo
 rthcoming).\n\n \n\nStudents may RSVP on Heel Life. This event is eligible 
 for CLE credit.\n\nRSVP for the 2026 Reckford Lecture on Jotform.\n\n \n\nT
 he Reckford Lecture\, which is co-sponsored by the Center for European Stud
 ies\, is hosted annually by the Institute for the Arts and Humanities. It w
 as established in 1990 by UNC classics professor Kenneth J. Reckford to hon
 or his wife\, Mary Stevens Reckford.

DESCRIPTION:Broken Beakers and Brilliant Minds: Fixing The Machinery of Sci
 ence \n\n  \n\nFrom the energy crisis and feeding eight billion people to d
 efeating cancer and coping with climate change\, humanity faces some rather
  large challenges today. To tackle them\, we need science running like a we
 ll-oiled machine. Unfortunately\, it has more often resembled a clunky old 
 engine: loud\, temperamental and prone to breaking down at the worst possib
 le moment. \n\n  \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding cuts for scienc
 e’s current woes\, but focusing only on money rather misses the point. Many
  of science’s biggest problems have been around for years\, sometimes centu
 ries. Scientists have long been criticized\, sidelined or attacked for havi
 ng ideas that were too new\, too inconvenient or simply too correct for the
  people in power at the time. Even truly unscientific behaviors\, like char
 acter assassination and fraud\, are not modern inventions… though they do s
 eem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance. \n\n  \n\nThe good news is that l
 ongstanding problems are not the same as unsolvable ones. Join Matt Kaplan\
 , science correspondent at The Economist and author of I Told You So! Scien
 tists Who Were Ridiculed\, Exiled and Imprisoned… For Being Right\, for a s
 pirited and insightful talk on the history of these endemic issues and what
  we can do to finally consign them to the scientific scrap heap.

DESCRIPTION:Filmed over twelve years with the same cast members who conspic
 uously age from segment to segment\, Boyhood offers one of cinema’s most li
 teral and radical explorations of coming of age. Following Mason (Ellar Col
 trane) from early childhood through his first days of college\, the film re
 fuses traditional narrative climaxes in favor of accumulation: small moment
 s\, shifting family dynamics\, and incremental changes in perception as tim
 e itself figures as the “main character.” Linklater’s method allows us to e
 xperience maturation as something lived\, uneven\, and quietly profound. \n
 The film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Disting
 uished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be
  screened at 7:30 p.m. at The Lumina Theater (620 Market St\, Chapel Hill\,

DESCRIPTION:Set in 1970s Brooklyn\, Crooklyn recounts childhood from the pe
 rspective of nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris)\, whose coming of
  age unfolds within the rhythms of Black family life\, neighborhood culture
 \, and social constraint. The film balances warmth and humor with moments o
 f rupture\, revealing how maturity often arrives through confrontation with
  authority\, injustice\, and grief. Lee presents growing up as both deeply 
 personal and inseparable from place\, race\, and community—an education sha
 ped as much by environment as by experience. \n  \nThe film will be introdu
 ced by Daelena Tinnin-Gadson\, Assistant Professor of Black Film Studies an
 d African American Literature. \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at
  the Varsity Theatre (123 East Franklin Street\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514). T
 ickets are free\, but must be reserved on the Ackland’s webpage. Register b
 elow. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scan

 ilm Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompa
 nies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester
 ’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie th
 eaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackla

DESCRIPTION:Religious studies professor Hugo Méndez (FFP ’22) will give a l
 ecture titled “Writing a New History of the Biblical Books of John\,” based
  on his recent research. Register for the event here. (This was previously 
 scheduled for Jan. 30.)\n\nThe Christian Bible contains four texts attribut
 ed to a disciple of Jesus named “John”: the Gospel of John and the letters 
 of 1 John\, 2 John\, and 3 John. But what do we know about the origins of t
 hese texts? Who really wrote them? In this lecture\, Méndez argues that the
 se works are a chain of falsely authored works (pseudepigrapha)\, written b
 y multiple pens over several decades. The author of the Gospel invented a d
 isciple of Jesus to serve as the narrator of his text\; the authors of the 
 letters\, in turn\, co-opted this character\, fleshing out so many afterliv
 es for him. This presentation traces this arc\, showing how a single act of
  disguised authorship inspired a new literary tradition and shaped twenty c
 enturies of Christian culture.\n\nHugo Méndez is an Associate Professor of 
 Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\, wher
 e he teaches New Testament and early Christianity. He is the author or co-a
 uthor of four books\, including two written as a Borden Faculty Fellow at t
 he IAH: The Gospel of John: A New History (Oxford\, 2025) and The Epistles 
 of John: Origins\, Authorship\, Purpose (Cambridge\, forthcoming). He is al
 so a frequent contributor to documentaries for History and other media outl
 ets.\n\n \n\nLearn more about the event at the IAH website. See all events

 to managing mode\, reacting to problems\, controlling tasks\, and just tryi
 ng to get through the day. This session explores what happens in the brain 
 during high-pressure moments and why that makes it harder to lead with clar
 ity. We will look at how pressure pushes leaders toward managing instead of
  leading\, and why that matters for your team’s growth and resilience. Most
  importantly\, you will leave with a simple\, practical tool to help you sl
 ow down\, refocus\, and lead in a way that aligns with your values\, even w
 hen the stakes are high.\n\nWorkshop Objectives:\n\n• Explain how stress im
 pacts the brain and leadership behavior\n• Identify your default leadership

 sional software development. Participants will learn to structure their Pyt
 hon code into reusable functions and store those functions as separate scri
 pts and/or packages. Participants will learn to write automated tests for t
 heir functions\, to help confirm that results are as expected and to ensure
  that future changes to code do not cause unexpected changes to results.\n\
 nWe will also discuss how to create reproducible “environments” that record
  package versions in use to help avoid package version incompatibilities an
 d ensure that results can be replicated even months or years after the orig
 inal analysis.\n\nModular design is best paired with a version control syst
 em. We will discuss how modular design practices integrate with Git and Git
 hub\, and how to set up “continuous integration” so that automated tests ar

 tagram influencing – can be valuable forms of evidence for qualitative rese
 archers. In this workshop\, participants will create their own research des
 igns to investigate a phenomenon of interest\, as evidenced through social 
 media data\, in a systematic and rigorous way. The Paulus and Wise research
  design decision framework will scaffold learners in how to identify an obj
 ect of interest\; articulate their philosophical and theoretical assumption
 s about how language functions online\; create focused and relevant researc
 h questions\; ensure methodological alignment across aspects of the study d
 esign\; resolve ethical dilemmas around treating social media as data\; ext
 ract and transform social media into a coherent dataset\; select appropriat
 e technologies for managing and analyzing data\; perform a systematic narra
 tive\, discourse and/or thematic analysis\; and establish the quality of th
 e findings. Course material will be drawn from Looking for Learning\, Insig
 ht and Transformation in Online Talk (Paulus & Wise\, Routledge\, 2019).\n\

DESCRIPTION:Most people can honestly say they believe it’s important to spe
 nd within their means and to save money for the future. Unfortunately\, goo
 d intentions are often at odds with how our mind works. For example\, many 
 people want to save for the future but have no motivation to because they h
 ave not imagined that future. This course addresses the psychology behind s
 aving money and adopting good financial habits. It will examine recent rese
 arch related to how and why people save vs. spend and identify strategies f
 or participants to change their financial mindset and develop new habits.\n
 \n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be able 
 to:\n• Understand why some people save for the future and other spend for t
 he moment\n• Identify non-productive financial patterns and habits\n• Recog
 nize the mental and behavioral habits of people who save\n• Create a compel
 ling financial future to motivate behavior change\n• Understand how to impr
 ove the capacity to delay gratification while increasing enjoyment\n• Ident
 ify seven simple tools to help change spending habits\n\n \n\nClick on Caro

DESCRIPTION:Ever pondered whether to include a variable in an analysis – is
  the variable necessary\, will its inclusion/exclusion introduce bias in th
 e analysis?  Why is the variable important anyways – is it a mediator\, a m
 oderator and a confounder some combination of these???\n\nThis course intro
 duces how to incorporate DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in analysis plannin
 g to help think through what variables to collect and use (or refrain from 
 using) in an analysis.\n\nTopics include:\n\nIntroducing the structure of D
 AGs and the rules for using them to guide variable selectionA deep dive int
 o the types of variable relations captured in DAGs with emphasis on mediati
 on\, moderation\, effect modification\, confounding and colliders and their
  potential to introduce bias in analysisHands on example of how to create a
 nd evaluate DAGs in R using the package daggityUse of DAGs may help inform 
 data collection and analytical plans in ways that enhance reproducibility.\
 n\nCourse prerequisites: None. Knowledge of regression analysis and R is he
 lpful but not required.\n\nRegistration and fee (refundable for UNCCH stude
 nts) are required for Zoom link access.

DESCRIPTION:Do you want to explore current research recommendations in the 
 literature on incorporating LLMs into qualitative/mixed methods data analys
 is\, or are you interested in implementing LLMs into your qualitative/mixed
  methods workflow?  If so\, this short course is designed for you!\n\nIn th
 is course we will examine current recommendations from the literature regar
 ding integrating AI (specifically LLMs) into the process of qualitative cod
 ing.  Acknowledging that a wide range of qualitative approaches exist\, all
  examples and recommendations in this course will be based on the 6 Phase T
 hematic Analysis Framework proposed by Braun & Clarke 2006 to simplify the 
 course scope.\n\nNo perquisites in qualitative methods or coding are requir
 ed for this course – just bring your computer & your curiosity!\n\nIn the c
 ourse we will:\n\nReview the qualitative approach of Thematic Analysis usin
 g the Braun & Clarke FrameworkGet a high-level\, very big picture understan
 ding of LLMs\, what they are & how they generate “natural language”Examine 
 current recommendations in the literature on incorporating LLMs in Thematic
  AnalysisDo hands-on activities in R that implement some of the current rec
 ommendations using the Braun & Clarke Framework. We will compare our result
 s to published results generated by all human coders using the same dataReg

DESCRIPTION:The problem with most attempts to adopt stress-management or se
 lf-care routines is that they require time\, effort and planning. The reali
 ty for many people who have stressful jobs is that they are too physically 
 exhausted and mentally depleted by the end of the day to initiate activitie
 s commonly recommended to reduce stress in their lives. The trick is to int
 ervene via multiple “micro-moments” of relaxation or mindful practices whic
 h only take 15 to 60 seconds. These moments of relaxation help bring stress
  levels down during the workday and interrupt the steady escalation of stre
 ss that creates physical and mental exhaustion. Also addressed: simple wind
 ing-down routines that can end the day in a calming\, mindful way.\n\n \n\n
 Workshop Objectives\nThis training will help you:\n• Describe how stress es
 calates through the day and leads to exhaustion\n• Consider whether your pr
 esent stress reduction habits may be adding to your overall stress\n• Under
 stand how simple short moments of relaxation throughout the day can permit 
 you reduce stress and\nconserve energy\n• Practice brief mindful moments of
  relaxation and learn how to integrate these moments into your workday\n• U
 nderstand the value of winding-down routines that foster a sense of safety 
 and personal control.\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent registration link an

DESCRIPTION:Take a glance through recent news or social media and you would
  be hard-pressed not to see mentions of chatbots and artificial intelligenc
 e (AI) methods aimed at generating text\, images and other content.  Recent
  work by Eloundou and colleagues (2023) explored the potential impact of th
 ese types of generative AI on labor markets\, and survey research\, specifi
 cally was among the top two most impacted industries.  Professor Andrew Ng 
 has been cited as saying “AI won’t replace human workers\, but ‘people that
  use it will replace people that don’t.’”  Much of the way researchers in t
 he social sciences and survey research are incorporating AI into their work
 flow involves some type of prompting.  Prompt Engineering approaches along 
 with more nuanced fine tuning approaches are being used and refined to bett
 er incorporate more robust approaches for AI incorporation into the researc
 h process.  In this shortcourse we will provide an overview of the emerging
  field of prompt engineering and illustrate how a prompt engineering approa
 ch and problem specification mindset can be useful for maximizing the utili
 ty of large language models\, specifically\, within social science.  Concep
 ts and experimental approaches will be illustrated using several real-world
 \, grounded and published work.  The shortcourse also incorporates an exper
 iential component that encourages participants to apply basic concepts that
  we cover in the course in real-time as we work on exercises together in th
 e later part of the course. Registration and fee (refundable for students) 
 are required for Zoom link access.

DESCRIPTION:Managing individuals who may be struggling with stress\, anxiet
 y\, depression and other mental health concerns can be a difficult balancin
 g act. Your role is to manage performance and to bring out the best in your
  workforce\, but accomplishing this often requires you to express concern a
 nd support when employees struggle emotionally. Managers often feel uncomfo
 rtable in this aspect of their role and may lack the important skills of “e
 motional management.” This course covers ways employees may present their d
 istress and offers insights and strategies on forging supportive empathic a
 lliances within the role of manager. The session also identifies common mis
 takes managers make in responding to employees in distress and explains com
 munication skills that express support and convey positive expectancy. Part
 icipants are also given information on how to refer employees to the Employ
 ee Assistance Program.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nBy the end of this work
 shop\, you will:\n• Understand the universality of mental health issues in 
 the workplace\n• Recognize the most common symptoms of mental illness\n• Id
 entify the most common unhelpful reactions to symptoms\, why they occur and
  how to avoid them\n• Identify ways of expressing compassion and developing
  an alliance with distressed employees\n• Reduce the stigma associated ment
 al illness and promote ways of supporting one another in the workplace\n• R
 ecognize the warning signs of suicide\n• Identify support services and reso
 urces for all leaders and employees\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talent regist

DESCRIPTION:For a long time\, the scientific community believed we were bor
 n with a certain number of brain cells and neural pathways and that\, once 
 damaged\, they could not be repaired. In reality\, our brains are much more
  flexible. Depending on our lifestyle\, we can weaken or destroy connection
 s\, or create new\, stronger ones. Engaging regularly in certain behaviors 
 and activities\, like physical exercise\, addressing mental health issues\,
  meditation\, and learning a new language or musical instrument\, support n
 ew wiring and can make existing pathways stronger. Essentially\, we can slo
 w down or somewhat prevent cognitive decline by doing challenging mental ex
 ercises to keep our brains fit for optimal power.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectiv
 es\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be able to:\nIdentify traits of 
 a healthy brain:\n• The ability to learn new skills\n• Judgment and intuiti
 on\n• Memory and perception\nIdentify barriers to good brain health:\n• Dep
 ression\n• Chronic stress\n• Unhealthy lifestyle\nIdentify methods for opti
 mal cognitive health:\n• Engaging in new skills and mentally challenging ac
 tivities\n• Meditation\n• Physical exercise\n• Brain training\n\n \n\nClick

DESCRIPTION:Your body responds to the way you think\, feel and act. This is
  often called the “mind/body connection.” When you are stressed\, anxious o
 r upset\, your body tries to tell you that something isn’t right. For examp
 le\, high blood pressure might develop after a particularly stressful event
 \, such as the death of a loved one. People with good emotional health are 
 aware of their thoughts\, feelings and behaviors. They have learned healthy
  ways to cope with the stress and problems that are a normal part of life. 
 They feel good about themselves and have healthy relationships. Poor emotio
 nal health can weaken your body’s immune system\, making you more likely to
  get colds and other infections during emotionally difficult times. Also\, 
 when you are feeling stressed\, anxious or upset\, you may not take care of
  your health as well as you should. You may not feel like exercising\, eati
 ng nutritious foods or taking medicine that your doctor prescribes. Abuse o
 f alcohol\, tobacco or other drugs may also be a sign of poor emotional hea
 lth.\n\n \n\nWorkshop Objectives\nAt the end of this workshop\, you will be
  able to:\nIdentify the relationship between mind and body\n• Describe how 
 the body influences emotional and mental functioning\n• Describe how our em
 otions\, beliefs and self talk impact our body\n• Identify symptoms of a po
 ssible mind/body disconnection\nIdentify ways to enhance the mind/body conn
 ection\n• Describe methods for achieving balance in life\n• Identify ways t
 o express feelings appropriately\n• Describe the importance of taking care 
 of your health\n• Describe ways to enhance awareness\nIdentify your persona
 l action plan for mind/body connection\n• Recognize the importance of consu
 lting with your physician\n• Describe which mind/body tools need to develop
 \n• List outside resources for further help\n\n \n\nClick on Carolina Talen
