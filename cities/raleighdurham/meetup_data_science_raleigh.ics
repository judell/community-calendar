SUMMARY:Four Signs Your Data Is (Actually) Ready for AI
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nMany enterprises believe they’re ready
  for AI once models are selected\, platforms are deployed\, and pilots are
  underway. But in practice\, AI initiatives often stall before reaching pr
 oduction—or they underperform once they do. The root cause? The data isn
 ’t actually ready.\n\nIn this thought-leadership session\, Naveen Punjab
 i from Google Cloud and Jake Bengtson from Striim unpack four critical sig
 ns that your data foundation can actually support AI at scale. Drawing fro
 m real-world customer patterns\, we’ll explore why centralized data isn
 ’t enough\, how invisible data errors derail AI outcomes\, and why stale
  data threatens use cases like RAG and AI agents.\n\nWhat we'll cover:\n\n
 * What Google Cloud is seeing across enterprise AI adoption—and where da
 ta readiness tends to break down\n* Four practical indicators your data is
  ready for trustworthy\, production-grade AI\n* Why validation and accurac
 y matter before any models get involved\n* How real-time pipelines give AI
  access to operational truth\n* How Google Cloud and Striim help enterpris
 es move from AI experimentation to enterprise impact\n\nThis session is bu
 ilt for data\, analytics\, and AI leaders ready to move beyond AI experime
 ntation—and build foundations that truly support scale.\n\n**What You'll
  Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Spot the Warning Signs:** Know when your data might
  silently sabotage your AI initiatives.\n\n2️⃣ **Go Beyond Centralizat
 ion:** Why a data lake isn’t the same as a data strategy.\n\n3️⃣ **E
 nable Live AI:** How real-time pipelines can unlock true operational intel
 ligence.\n\n4️⃣ **Validate Early\, Scale Confidently:** Why data quali
 ty must be addressed before model deployment.\n\n5️⃣**Learn from the F
 ield:** What Google Cloud and Striim have seen across real enterprise AI j
 ourneys.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q0417jxY0)**

SUMMARY:The Agentic Shift: Designing AI That Can Reason\, Plan\, and Act
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nAs AI evolves from passive tools to acti
 ve collaborators\, enterprises face a pivotal shift: embracing systems tha
 t can not only respond but also take initiative. This webinar unpacks what
  it means to build and deploy agentic AI—models that possess goal-direct
 ed reasoning\, dynamic planning capabilities\, and the ability to autonomo
 usly execute tasks across complex workflows.\n\nWe’ll explore architectu
 ral and governance considerations for enterprise adoption\, including how 
 to integrate agentic systems into existing data ecosystems\, ensure transp
 arency and control\, and maintain human-in-the-loop oversight. Join us for
  a practical\, forward-looking discussion on how to prepare your organizat
 ion for AI that doesn’t just assist—but acts.\n\n**What You'll Learn:*
 *\n\n1️⃣ **What Agentic AI Really Means:** Understand the core compone
 nts—reasoning\, planning\, and autonomous action—and how they differ f
 rom traditional AI assistants.\n\n2️⃣ **Enterprise Readiness:** Learn 
 what technical and organizational infrastructure you need to safely and ef
 fectively deploy agentic systems.\n\n3️⃣ **Designing for Oversight and
  Control:** Explore observability\, guardrails\, and human-in-the-loop str
 ategies for managing proactive AI in production environments.\n\nPanelists
  to be announced soon.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q03VW1dg0)**

SUMMARY:From Data Governance to Semantic Intelligence
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nAs AI adoption accelerates\, many enterp
 rises are hitting the same wall: traditional approaches to data governance
 \, metadata management\, and cataloging were not designed to support AI an
 d AI agents operating at scale. Fragmented tools\, siloed semantics\, and 
 inconsistent definitions make it difficult for both people and AI systems 
 to trust and act on data.\n\nIn this webinar\, industry expert Mike Fergus
 on and Collate co-founder and CEO Suresh Srinivas explore how leading orga
 nizations are evolving from tool-centric data catalogs and governance towa
 rd semantic intelligence\, a unified approach that brings governance\, con
 text\, and meaning together to support analytics\, automation\, and AI at 
 scale.\n\nCollate co-founder and CTO Harsha Chintalapani will also provide
  a brief demonstration showing how semantic intelligence is applied in pra
 ctice\, including how data teams design and build AI agents on governed en
 terprise data.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ Why data discovery\, g
 overnance\, lineage\, and data quality and observability must work togethe
 r to support AI-driven use cases\n\n2️⃣ How fragmented semantic layers
  and tool-specific context limit trust\, scale\, and reuse across analytic
 s and AI\n\n3️⃣What semantic intelligence means in practice and how it
  extends beyond traditional data catalogs\n\n4️⃣How shared meaning ena
 bles secure\, governed access to data for both people and AI agents\n\n5
 ️⃣How semantic intelligence supports the delivery of trusted\, consuma
 ble data products with meaning\, quality signals\, and governance that are
  ready for analytics and AI agents\n\n6️⃣What it takes to make data tr
 uly AI-ready without sacrificing control\, compliance\, or consistency\n\n
 Designed for data leaders\, enterprise architects\, and governance teams\,
  this session explains why existing catalogs and governance tools remain u
 seful—but are no longer sufficient on their own—and how enterprises ca
 n operationalize shared meaning to support analytics\, data engineering\, 
 and AI initiatives at scale.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042D1NJ

SUMMARY:AI Infrastructure That Scales: Foundations for Real-World Deployme
 nt
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nExperimentation is easy. Real-world depl
 oyment? That’s where the infrastructure proves its worth.\n\nIn this ses
 sion\, we’ll go beyond prototypes and pilot programs to explore what it 
 really takes to build AI infrastructure that holds up under production dem
 ands. From GPU scheduling and model orchestration to observability\, gover
 nance\, and scaling compute across hybrid environments—this discussion i
 s for teams ready to move past the lab and into sustained delivery.\n\nOur
  panel of leaders will break down architectural trade-offs\, emerging best
  practices\, and the organizational realities of supporting production-gra
 de AI.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Foundational Stack Component
 s:** What your AI infrastructure needs to support scale\, speed\, and stab
 ility in production.\n\n2️⃣ **Deployment Realities:** Insights into la
 tency\, availability\, compliance\, and lifecycle management when shipping
  AI to production.\n\n3️⃣**Infrastructure as Collaboration:** How infr

SUMMARY:The Context Layer: The Emerging Stack for Context-Aware AI
DESCRIPTION:Data Science Raleigh\nAs enterprises push AI into production\,
  context isn’t a luxury—it’s a requirement. Whether you're mitigatin
 g hallucinations\, aligning responses with brand and policy guidelines\, o
 r ensuring traceable\, compliant outcomes\, context-aware architecture is 
 becoming foundational to trustworthy AI.\n\nThis webinar explores the “c
 ontext layer”—the emerging stack of tools\, techniques\, and workflows
  that inject dynamic\, domain-specific intelligence into AI systems. We’
 ll examine how leading teams are designing for retrieval-augmented generat
 ion (RAG)\, grounding\, memory\, and orchestration to ensure outputs refle
 ct the right data\, tone\, and constraints at the right time.\n\n**What Yo
 u'll Learn:**\n\n1️⃣ **Architecting the Context Layer:** What the emer
 ging stack looks like—from vector databases and memory systems to orches
 tration layers and policy enforcement.\n\n2️⃣ **Reducing Hallucination
 s:** How context-aware design helps constrain generative outputs to known\
 , verifiable sources.\n\n3️⃣ **Boosting Trust & Alignment:** Technique
 s for integrating domain-specific knowledge\, tone\, and compliance rules 
 directly into AI interactions.\n\n4️⃣ **From Static to Dynamic Context
 :** When to use retrieval\, when to use memory\, and how to balance both f
 or adaptive\, scalable systems.\n\n**[Register here](https://hubs.ly/Q042c
