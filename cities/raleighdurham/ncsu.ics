DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.

DESCRIPTION:For the first time in history\, there is the possibility that a
 n organization can have four distinct generations in the workforce. While w
 e need to be careful not to make too many generalizations about different a
 ge groups\, it is helpful to categorize some aspects of each group’s behavi
 or\, needs and working styles to promote working relationships built on mut
 ual understanding.\n\nJoin Learn and Organizational Development (L&OD) for 
 a session that will provide each participant with an understanding of the d
 ifferent working styles and preferences and how each generation expects to 
 be treated as employees. By understanding these differences\, each person c
 an contribute to the success of the team and organization regardless of gen
 eration.\n\nThis workshop is part of L&OD's LEAD Events\, an initiative tha
 t provides employees with opportunities to learn or refresh skills that can
  help them grow their careers. LEAD Events are a component of L&OD's Leader
 ship Education and Development\, or LEAD\, program.

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.

 ffect that landscape architecture and urban design have on cities is what d
 rew Scott to this profession nearly 20 years ago\; and over the years he’s 
 developed a passion for engaging the public throughout the design process\,
  further deepening the relationships between people and place. His focus on
  the public realm is driven by a desire to create social interactions and b

 ementary school teacher to a landscape architect and landed at Civitas. The
 ir intention to build a team made up of diverse backgrounds and the mindset
  that “good ideas can come from anywhere” really spoke to Rebecca as she fo

DESCRIPTION:Join the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies for a l
 ecture titled "Atheism Before Modernity: Radical Doubt in Ancient India."\n
 \nAtheism is often assumed to be a modern development\, emerging in respons
 e to science\, secularization and enlightenment critiques of religion. This
  talk will challenge that assumption by examining forms of radical doubt wi
 thin the religious world of ancient India. Focusing on traditions of the Āj
 īvikas\, who denied divine creation and embraced a deterministic cosmos\, t
 he lecture will explore how Indian thinkers debated gods\, fate\, moral cau
 sality and liberation long before the modern period. Drawing on Buddhist\, 
 Jaina\, Brahmanical and Tamil sources\, the talk will highlight the methodo
 logical challenges of reconstructing heterodox traditions preserved largely
  through polemical accounts and ask what these ancient debates reveal about
  the diversity of religious thought and the limits of categories such as be
 lief\, atheism and religion.

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.

 sign the tomorrow we want to see. Through imagination\, scholarship and age
 ncy\, we affirm that we exist in the future\, and it will be a future that 
 we shape for ourselves. \n\nNC State students\, staff\, faculty and alumni

DESCRIPTION:This masterclass offers an immersive physical exploration of Ca
 poeira Angola\, the Afro-Brazilian art form that weaves together martial ar
 ts\, dance\, and music. Participants will build upper and lower body streng
 th\, agility\, and grounded flow in warm-up and sequencing while learning t
 o move within the rhythmic dialogue concluding in a Roda. Through cultural 
 context\, and embodied practice\, students will experience Capoeira as a li
 ving expression of connection. Rooted in history and alive in contemporary 
 practice\, this class centers physicality and culture\, shaping the collect
 ive power with honor for the dance form.\n\n \n\nArtist Bio: Jasmine Powell

 f the work she engages with through a creative expressionist lens.

 ed their streaming hit\, The 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy\, as a mind-bending i

 ppropriate for audiences of all ages.

DESCRIPTION:The cosmic microwave background\, or CMB\, is the oldest light 
 in the universe. Over the last 60 years\, studies of the CMB have revealed 
 numerous fascinating results\, including the age of the universe. Nearly al
 l of the results come from detailed analyses of maps made by CMB observator
 ies. To the untrained eye\, these maps seem like random collections of colo
 rs and lines\, but delving into the details of these maps reveals patterns 
 that unlock fascinating features of our universe. Some implications of the 
 non-randomness of these CMB maps will be explored during Coffee and Viz\, a
  series that allows NC State researchers share their visualization work and
  discuss topics of interest.

DESCRIPTION:The 2026 Buchdahl Lecture will focus on over 300\,000 years of 
 human history\, using the stories of our ancestors and Indigenous cultures 
 to show how we have survived climate change\, war\, diseases and countless 
 other challenges. We will explore the story of Egypt's so-called Old Kingdo
 m collapse in 2200 BCE\, learning how that time period is a mirror for life
  today and how societies respond to concurrent crises.  The archaeological 
 site of el Lisht\, Egypt's capital from the Middle Kingdom (1800 BCE)\, wil
 l provide a case study for what might be possible following a period of mul
 tiple crises. What we will learn is that the imminent societal collapse pro
 moted by countless tech bros and podcasters is simply a lie. Our ancestors 
 nearly became extinct almost a million years ago\, and yet\, they persisted
 \, evolving into homo sapiens. Our human story is one of survival and hope.
  A better world is possible\, with the road well-lit via evidence from the 
 archaeological evidence and Indigenous wisdom.

DESCRIPTION:Healthy plants start with healthy soil\, but what is healthy so
 il\, and how can you build it in your own garden? This course will take you
  below the surface to explore the science and structure that make soils thr
 ive. By delving into the chemistry\, the biology and the physics that drive
  soil health and fertility\, you’ll gain the tools you need to cultivate a 
 richer\, more resilient garden from the ground up.\n\nIn this expanded five
 -week course\, we’ll take a closer look at the essential principles of soil
  science and how to apply them in practical\, gardener-friendly ways. You’l
 l explore how soils behave — how texture\, structure and compaction influen
 ce water movement\, aeration and root growth — and gain practical tips on s
 ampling and assessing your soil so you know what you’re working with. Along
  the way\, we’ll connect these principles to soil fertility and plant nutri
 tion\, exploring how nutrients move through the soil\, how fertilizers work
  and how to feed your plants effectively without overdoing it.\n\nWhether y
 ou’re troubleshooting problem areas\, establishing new garden beds or simpl
 y eager to understand what’s happening beneath your feet\, this course will
  equip you with the knowledge and confidence to build better soils and grow
  stronger\, more resilient plants.

 to an accident? Maybe you said to yourself\, “I knew I shouldn’t have gone

 nd\n\nEric Kramer’s work focuses on questions of what landscapes communicat
 e to and about their communities—whether cherished memories\, bold aspirati
 ons or contested histories. A writer\, teacher\, and thought leader within 
 the discipline\, Eric’s approach to practice is rooted equally in basic res
 earch and applied design thinking. He leads commissions with the understand
 ing that they are cultural spaces speaking for the societies who build them
  and speaking to future generations. Through two decades working within con
 sequential landscapes across the United States\, he has guided the renewal 
 and enrichment of numerous campuses\, cultural institutions\, and urban dis
 tricts. He has been responsible for major works within the practice’s caree
 r: The Clark Art Institute\, Boston’s Central Wharf\, Duke University’s stu
 dent life precinct\, and a comprehensive interpretive plan for The Alamo in
  San Antonio. Notable current projects under Eric’s leadership include work
  at MIT and Harvard’s new Enterprise Research Campus\, Longwood Gardens’ ne
 w conservatory complex\, and a framework plan for the University of Pennsyl
 vania’s Morris Arboretum.

DESCRIPTION:NC State Innovation and Entrepreneurship has developed an incub
 ator program to support early-stage startups. During the incubator\, studen
 ts will work on furthering their concepts through a variety of fundamental 
 practices\, such as doing customer discovery\, exploring business modeling 
 and thinking through commercialization strategy. This friendly\, low-stakes
  and informal cohort is the perfect place to bounce ideas off one another a
 nd hold one another accountable for tangible next steps for your new ventur
 e.\n\nThe incubator occurs over a rolling 10-week period\, with entrepreneu
 rs joining on a drop-in basis. Student entrepreneurs are also eligible for 
 micro funding. Funding can range from roughly $200 to $800 per student (up 
 to $1\,000 per team)\, depending on your venture and its needs.\n\nWhile th
 e cohort will meet for two hours every other week\, the program gives stude
 nts access to an asynchronous library of resources they can navigate at the
 ir own pace. Throughout the incubator period\, participants will also be co
 nnected to mentorship and other forms of support. Every other week’s sessio
 n will kick off with founder updates\, including what’s working\, roadblock
 s and goals for the week.\n\nFor more information about Launchpad and to ap

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:Join NC State Industry Extension Services for a webinar that wi

 ederally funded grant for small and medium-sized manufacturers in North Car
 olina who are ready to adopt technology. The webinar's goal is to provide t
 argeted technical assistance to small- to medium-sized manufacturers to inc
 rease awareness of\, access to and implementation of innovative smart manuf
 acturing technologies. The benefits of smart manufacturing are:\n\nImproved
  efficiency: Smart factories can monitor equipment performance and automate
  complex processes\, improving accuracy and reducing human error.Increased 
 productivity: Smart factories can use data to identify issues\, such as whe
 n a machine slows down production and then use artificial intelligence syst
 ems to resolve the issues.Long-term cost savings: Smart factories can use p
 redictive maintenance to identify potential problems early and address them
  at a convenient time\, which can save money.Greater flexibility: Smart fac
 tories can scale production quickly to meet changing demand and can customi
 ze products to meet specific customer needs.You can complete a short applic
 ation to find out if your company is ready to participate in the program. F
 or more information about the webinar\, visit the NC State Industry Extensi

DESCRIPTION:In 2019\, YouTube creator Mariana Colín started building her fi
 lm analysis YouTube channel\, The Morbid Zoo\, as an exercise in developing
  the video essay format as a legitimate mode of academic publishing. Since 
 then\, her videos have been viewed over 9 million times. YouTube is accessi
 ble and customizable\, offering a way to engage directly with a nonacademic
  audience. However\, it is also isolating\, biased toward particular kinds 
 of engagement\; it is also deeply politically fraught. In this talk\, Colín
  will share what she’s discovered about social media’s academic use — its s
 uccesses\, its failures and its possible futures.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

 s some spirits live there that only she can see — not scary ones but welcom
 ing ghosts who keep her company\, play games and help her navigate her new 
 environment. The inn’s motto is that it welcomes all and will reject none\,
  and this is soon put to the test as a string of new guests challenge Okko’
 s ability to be a gracious host. But ultimately\, Okko discovers that dedic

DESCRIPTION:As part of the culmination of the NC State/Raleigh Civic Orches
 tra’s 10-year Premiere Project\, the Raleigh Civic Chamber Orchestra will p
 resent the world premiere of new music by the Grammy Award-Winning Turtle I
 sland String Quartet’s cellist Naseem Alatrash. The music combines jazz and
  Arabic influences in an innovative\, emotional exploration of music that e
 xists between worlds — and across borders. \n\nThe concert will also includ
 e music from the American Suite by Czech composer Antonín Dvorák\, written 
 at the same time as his beloved New World Symphony\, while living in Americ
 a.\n\nOne of history’s first ethno-musicologists\, Béla Bartók traveled wid
 ely documenting the indigenous musics of Eastern and Central Europe and of 
 Northern Africa. His Hungarian Pictures depict music that is between the fo
 lk and classical worlds and reflects the culture of a people whose borders 
 were always shifting — their homeland ruled by an ever-shifting assortment 
 of empires.\n\nRounding out the program will be Polish/Israeli/American com
 poser Jan Radzynski’s exploration of the common threads of music and cultur
 e in the Middle East and Pulitzer Prize finalist Mary Kouyoumdijan’s Tagh\,
  drawing on her American experience and her Armenian roots. \n\nTickets wil

 elief in the power of architecture to affect change and improve the quality
  of life for all. The studio\, a New York City certified Women-Owned Busine

  on addressing pressing issues in contemporary society through design that 
 promotes the wellbeing of communities and the long-term sustainability of t
 he environment.  \n\nDesigning at the intersection of architecture and the 
 public realm\, the studio distills the essence of cultures and communities 
 through work that ranges in scale and type\, from interventions in historic
  precincts to new large-scale monumental buildings. To each project\, STR |
  A·D brings an attitude about design that connects people to place and to e
 ach other through an architecture of interpretation. The work is inspired b
 y the confluence of history\, site\, program and the relationship of interi
 or and exterior space. Whether rural landscape\, campus setting or a dense 
 urban context\, STR | A·D seeks to create an architecture that is fused wit
 h its surroundings and the natural world.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:For the culmination of the NC State/Raleigh Civic Orchestra’s 1
 0-year Premiere Project\, the Raleigh Civic Symphony will present the world
  premiere of Grammy-winning composer Jeff Scott’s Athena: Concerto for Trum
 pet and Orchestra. Renowned trumpet virtuoso Mary Elizabeth Bowden (Seraph 
 Brass) will perform the work\, a tribute to Athena\, the Greek goddess of w
 ar and wisdom and weaving. The powerful\, virtuosic work highlights the fig
 ure of Athena as a wise negotiator\, imagining her bringing together warrin
 g factions in both ancient times and the modern Middle East. \n\nThe concer
 t will weave together disparate traditions\, cultures and musics in a portr
 ait of wisdom and a call for peace. With the concerto as the centerpiece\, 
 the concert will weave together the different threads of Athena’s life and 
 legend. Music from Holst’s audience favorite\, The Planets\, highlights bot
 h her lineage (her father\, Jupiter) and role in war (the Roman war god Mar
 s). Gilbert and Sullivan’s aria Minerva – Oh\, Goddess Wise extolls the vir
 tues of the Roman equivalent to Athena and John William’s emotional A Praye
 r for Peace (from Stephen Spielberg’s Munich) is a plea from the heart for 
 peace\, based in the Middle Eastern turmoil of the recent past. \n\nThe orc
 hestra will collaborate with faculty from the Wilson College of Textiles in
  the premiere of the new multidisciplinary work set to Scott’s music. The p
 roject explores the role of textiles and weaving as one of humanity’s first
  integrative sciences — combining chemistry\, physics and mathematics — as 
 well as representing and bringing together cultures. Weaving helps tell the
  story of a culture\, bringing together disparate cultural and strands in a
  unified whole. Much as Athena’s role as a negotiator brings together warri
 ng factions in pursuit of peace\, the threads of science\, culture and art 
 are woven together along with disparate cultures\, countries and musics. \n
 \nTickets go on sale Monday\, Feb. 16.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:Join Belle Boggs\, professor in the Department of English at NC

 d of Wyatt Outlaw: From Reconstruction Through Black Lives Matter. Outlaw’s
  story was one of Black success — he was a Union League leader\, business o
 wner and the first Black town constable and commissioner in Graham\, a smal
 l town in North Carolina’s Alamance County. But in 1870\, the Ku Klux Klan 
 murdered Outlaw\, setting off a dramatic series of events. Allen and Boggs 
 both sought to discover why Outlaw had been erased from mainstream history 
 books. In The Legend of Wyatt Outlaw\, they share what they found in artful
  detail and connect Outlaw’s story to the violence against Black people in 
 Alamance and throughout the United States\, from Reconstruction through Jim
  Crow\, the civil rights era and Black Lives Matter.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:Caring for plants is both an art and a science — part intuition
 \, part know-how. Every gardener\, from beginner to expert\, faces the same
  essential questions: When should I prune? How much should I water? What’s 
 the best way to plant\, fertilize or repot? In this class\, Bryce Lane will
  bring decades of horticultural expertise to demystify these everyday tasks
 \, showing you not just what to do but why it works.\n\nOver eight weeks\, 
 you’ll explore the fundamental practices that keep gardens thriving\, learn
 ing how to perform each one with confidence and purpose. You’ll uncover the
  science behind good technique — understanding how soil\, water\, nutrients
  and plant biology interact — while also developing the practical judgment 
 that comes only with experience.\n\nEach session will focus on one key aspe
 ct of plant care\, building a complete toolkit for growing healthier\, more
  resilient plants in any garden setting.

DESCRIPTION:Every second Sunday\, get your biking fix with the Greenway Gea
 r Collective's Bike Maintenance Class and Group Ride. Their 10 a.m. monthly
  basic maintenance class is a great way to learn the essentials of bike car
 e and tune-ups. Each class is shaped by the needs of those who show up with
  no two being the same.\n\nThen at noon\, you can join a themed group ride 
 starting and ending at The Bike Library container on the shores of Lake Ral
 eigh. Bring your own bike or rent one of theirs. Feel free to show up for t
 he class\, the group ride or both.\n\nWhile both of these events are drop-i
 n accessible and encouraged\, signing up in advance for the class or pre-fi
 lling out the waiver for the ride is always greatly appreciated.

DESCRIPTION:Headlining the Gregg Museum’s Music at the Lawn concert will be
  Mountain Walrus\, a group that serves up a unique brand of southern funk f
 rom the mountains of Southwest Virginia. Led by Foster Burton’s soulful son
 gwriting\, Mountain Walrus draws on elements of New Orleans funk and southe
 rn rock to create a sound that’s right at home in Appalachia. The band is q
 uickly growing a fan base across the Southeast thanks to their dynamic live
  shows and appearances at festivals\, such as FloydFest\, Rooster Walk\, th
 e Mountain Music Festival and Floyd Yoga Jam. Burton is backed by Mason Jen
 nelle on drums\, Ben Hite on keys\, Ryan Ratliff on saxophone and multi-ins
 trumentalist Brach Rauchle. The band just released their new album\, Less I
 s More\, and has more music coming very soon.\n\nOpening for Mountain Walru
 s will be Brittany Stephenson\, a Dallas-based vocalist and multimedia arti
 st blending folk storytelling with contemporary themes. Raised in a West Te
 xas musical family\, she performed extensively as a vocalist for The Coverl
 ets at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art\, as well as the Smithson
 ian and the Metropolitan Museum. Now she creates performance art pieces tha
 t witness the weight and electricity of being human.
