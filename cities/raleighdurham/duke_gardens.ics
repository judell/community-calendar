SUMMARY:Plug and Play: A Guide to Planting Perennial Plugs (virtual)
DESCRIPTION:Most gardeners are familiar with planting container-grown perennials\, but using plugs requires a shift in mindset and technique. These young starter plants\, grown in trays instead of pots\, offer distinct advantages: they are cost-effective\, easier to plant and establish quickly. They are ideal for large areas\, slopes and under trees. However\, not every gardener is familiar with plugs. Planting them successfully takes a bit of practical know-how that even experienced gardeners will appreciate refining. Join Shannon Currey\, education and outreach at Izel Native Plant\, to learn the pros and cons of plugs\, when they’re most appropriate and best practices for handling\, planting and managing them. With these essentials\, you’ll be planting like a pro! \nFee: Free; registration required. \nLocation: Zoom. The recording will be shared with all registrants. \nAccessibility: This will be a virtual program that takes place on Zoom with the option to enable closed captioning.

SUMMARY:Botany by Plant Family: The Key to See
DESCRIPTION:Learning to notice plant family patterns can greatly aid in demystifying the “green wall” of plant species around us.

Discuss edibility\, medicinality\, craft\, wildlife support and landscape beauty as you gain a more holistic understanding of the major plants comprising Southern U.S. flora and their potential ecological and ethnobotanical applications. \nFee: $32; 20% discount for Duke Gardens members with discount code. \nParking: Fees apply. \nLocation: Onsite at Duke Gardens. Meeting location will be included in a program reminder email sent before the program. \nAccessibility: This will be a small group program that takes place partially seated indoors and partially outdoors traveling on a combination of paved and unpaved paths with some uneven surfaces and moderate inclines.
