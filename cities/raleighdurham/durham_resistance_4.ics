 SBOE Co-Location Rules (Rule 6A-1.0998271)\, the so-called Schools of Hope 
 law is mutating into a full-blown corporate takeover mechanism of our neigh
 borhood schools. These corporations are already targeting neighborhood publ
 ic schools\, seizing public school buildings rent-free. (link to learn more
  somewhere in here)\n\n·      This rule further weakens our neighborhood sc
 hools\, stripping control from parents and school boards\, and draining muc
 h needed funding and resources our children need.\n \n📞 Join fellow advoca

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

 r monthly 30-minute Frontline Update_\n\nJoin our first Frontline Update of
  the year for a fast-moving briefing from the front lines of the democracy 
 fight. We’ll spotlight three states\, three strategies\, and real ways you 
 can take action immediately.\n\nWhat you’ll hear:\n\n**Wisconsin -  A Supre
 me Court Race That Will Shape the Next Decade**\n -  An open 10-year Wiscon
 sin Supreme Court seat is on the line. Hear directly from the campaign team
  for Judge Chris Taylor about what it will take to win—and how Swing Blue A
 lliance is backing this race through targeted mail\, research\, and phone b
 anking ahead of the April 7 election.\n\n**North Carolina -  Why We’re Back
 ing a Primary** - \nSwing Blue Alliance rarely endorses in primaries—but th
 is race is different. Learn why we’re supporting Rev. Dr. Rodney Sadler for
  NC House District 106\, how this contest fits into the broader fight for d
 emocracy in North Carolina\, and why phone banking right now matters.\n\n**
 Indiana -  How Activists Win in a Red State** - \nMADVoters Executive Direc
 tor Amy Courtney shares hard-won lessons from organizing under a supermajor
 ity: fighting extreme gerrymandering\, building rapid-response teams\, trac
 king legislation in real time\, and training voters to engage effectively.\
 n\nThis is a must-attend for anyone serious about protecting democracy and 
 building power—especially in tough political environments. Stay afterward f
 or Q&A and discussion.\n\nHow to prepare:\nNew to Swing Blue? Founded in 20
 18\, Swing Blue Alliance is the largest all-volunteer\, Democratic grassroo
 ts organization headquartered in Massachusetts. In partnership with organiz
 ations in swing states\, we develop evidence-based strategies to protect ou
 r democracy\, work on competitive local and national elections\, and streng
 then the Democratic Party at the grassroots level.  \n\nGuided by our partn
 ers and using effective\, evidence-based strategies\, our volunteers make p
 hone calls\, write postcards\, and make financial contributions to support 
 our core strategies. We also plan trips to connect with voters in person. W
 e’d love to have you join us. Fill out the 2025 Strategy Survey (https://sw
 ingbluealliance.org/join/) to tell us about you so we can match you to the 
 actions that matter to you most.\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingblueallian

  experiencing a high volume of folks logging on to Zoom at the same time\, 
 if you have trouble logging in - you can join us via livestream by heading 
 to the one million rising website <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=htt

  livestream\n\nAcross the country\, authoritarian forces are getting bolder
  and more dangerous. Trump and his allies are not hiding their agenda: mass
  deportations\, rollbacks of civil rights\, weaponized courts\, and full-sc
 ale attacks on our democracy. We don’t have to wait until it’s too late. We
  can stop this. But it’ll take all of us—not just on single days of mass ac
 tion\, but through sustained organizing in our communities.\n\nThat’s why t
 his summer\, we’re launching One Million Rising—a national effort to train 
 one million people in the strategic logic and practice of non-cooperation\,
  as well as the basics of community organizing and campaign design. This is
  how we build people power that can’t be ignored. You’re invited to join us
 —and lead. \n\nLet’s build a force bigger than fear and louder than hate.  
 Let’s get ready. Let’s get organized. Let’s stop Trump.\n\n**Did you miss S

  our strategy\, but how you can lead a discussion with others and get them 
 on board with taking action in your community. You&#39\;ll host your first 
 community resistance gathering after this session\, before our next session
 . \n\n**Session 3: What Now? - August 13**\nYou&#39\;ll be onboarded to bas
 ic campaign design and learn how to implement it locally as well as get plu
 gged into our next national campaign work. Your second community resistance
  gathering will move this action forward.\n\nSign up for all 3 sessions to 
 get the most out of this experience. Watch it live with a friend in person\
 , and get ready now to host your own community resistance gatherings after 
 the second and third sessions. This is how we get to 1 million!\n\n<a href=

 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b

 br><br>The impact of harassment on youth is very real. It can lead to troub
 le sleeping\, loss of appetite\, decreased class participation\, and though
 ts about transferring schools. Right To Be believes that stopping harassmen
 t amongst young people depends on empowering youth to take action themselve
 s. This one-hour training recommended for grades 8 – 12 offers a specially 
 adapted version of our 5Ds of bystander intervention methodology. The train
 ing can offer an intersectional approach (examining harassment in all forms
 ) or specifically address bystander intervention to stop gender-based haras
 sment\, anti-LGBTQ+ harassment\, or race-based harassment amongst youth. We
  begin by offering participants an understanding of what harassment is\, ho
 w it’s different than bullying\, and that it can happen anywhere – at schoo
 l or on campus\, on playgrounds\, on buses\, or in stores and other places 
 of business. We’ll talk through five strategies for intervention – Distract
 \, Delegate\, Document\, Delay\, and Direct – and teach participants how to
  prioritize their own safety while intervening. Then\, through our expanded
  interactive learning experience\, we incorporate realistic practice scenar
 ios and group feedback sessions to help participants achieve an applied und
 erstanding of the 5Ds concepts and leave them feeling more confident to int
 ervene the next time they witness harassment happen amongst their peers.

 wing truths:\n\n1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by st
 anding in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.\n2. Trump’s aggressive a
 nd violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communitie
 s to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.\n3. Listening-forw
 ard conversations that support people to reflect on their values\, feelings
  and experiences can shift their attitudes\, perspective and behavior.\n\nT
 hat's why we're channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can
  take with us.\n\n**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters abo
 ut their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in 
 the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House i
 n the 2026 elections.**\n\nTogether\, we can move the needle and build powe
 r.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources\,  trainin
 g and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical convers
 ations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s

 is workshop dives deeply into the art of “reclaiming your space\,” Right To
  Be’s supportive skill for confidently responding to harassment. In today’s
  world\, where personal boundaries often feel increasingly challenged\, the
  power to respond confidently to harassment has never been more vital. We a
 ll deserve to feel safe and confident in our spaces\, but may hesitate to r
 espond in ways that honor both our instinctive reactions and our desire to 
 reclaim our power in these situations.</p><p>Pulling from Self Offense’s so
 matic and embodied expertise –  and 10 degrees of black belt between them –
  this training equips participants with:</p><ul><li>Simple tools to assess 
 situations objectively</li><li>Practical strategies to harness your natural
  responses</li><li>Concrete ways to set boundaries and reclaim your space</
 li><li>Real-world techniques for building lasting resilience</li></ul><p>Th
 rough guided practice and supportive discussion\, participants will gain pr
 actical experience in turning reactive moments into opportunities for empow
 ered action\, develop renewed confidence in their instincts\, and learn to 
 respond powerfully to harassment while staying true to themselves.</p>

 ou may be prompted to enter your information into a Zoom registration form 
 before joining. Please fill in your information to be admitted into the Zoo
 m meeting!\n\n#### Right now is the time to intervene.  To step up.  To mov
 e our people.\n\nAs the Trump Administration continues to deploy violent IC
 E agents to our nation's cities\, we remain clear and centered on the follo
 wing truths:\n\n1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by st
 anding in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.\n2. Trump’s aggressive a
 nd violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communitie
 s to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.\n3. Listening-forw
 ard conversations that support people to reflect on their values\, feelings
  and experiences can shift their attitudes\, perspective and behavior.\n\nT
 hat's why we're channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can
  take with us.\n\n**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters abo
 ut their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in 
 the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House i
 n the 2026 elections.**\n\nTogether\, we can move the needle and build powe
 r.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources\,  trainin
 g and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical convers
 ations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s 
 commonsense beliefs around immigration policy\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/su

 iece of legislation that claims to address election integrity by requiring 
 proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.\nHowever\, it disproport
 ionately impacts eligible voters\, particularly naturalized citizens and ma
 rginalized communities\, by creating unnecessary barriers to voting. It cou
 ld lead to voter suppression by complicating the registration process and p
 otentially disenfranchising eligible voters who may face challenges in prov
 iding specific documentation.\n\n\n**Why It Suppresses Votes:**\n\n\nThe SA
 VE Act would make it harder for millions of Americans—especially students\,
  seniors\, and veterans—to vote by imposing strict documentation requiremen
 ts many eligible voters may struggle to meet. For example:\n\n* Students of
 ten move frequently for school or work and may not have updated IDs or proo
 f of citizenship readily available.\n* Seniors who no longer drive\, have e
 xpired IDs\, or live in assisted facilities may face challenges obtaining t
 he required documents.\n* Veterans who use military IDs (which don’t prove 
 citizenship) or have recently returned to civilian life may also encounter 
 barriers.\n* These groups\, along with naturalized citizens and low-income 
 individuals\, are disproportionately affected by such restrictions\, creati
 ng unnecessary obstacles to exercising their right to vote. This undermines
  democracy by silencing voices and discouraging participation.\n\nJoin Comm
 on Cause for an important phone bank as we mobilize voters to take action a
 gainst dangerous legislation in state houses around the country. We will fo
 cus on the most urgent campaigns that need our help. Some of these campaign
 s may include stopping bills that will make it harder for millions of Ameri
 cans—especially students\, seniors\, and veterans—to cast their ballots. We
  need your help to ensure voters across the country call their state repres
 entatives and demand they protect the freedom to vote.\n\nNo prior experien
 ce is necessary—our team will provide full training at the start of each sh
 ift!\n\n## What to Expect:\n\n* A step-by-step walkthrough of our Phone Dia
 ler tools.\n* Expert tips on effective communication with voters.\n* Opport
 unities to ask questions and connect with other like-minded volunteers.\n\n

 to build powerful communications to uplift the Students Rise Up campaign!\n
 \nIn Minneapolis\, ICE has killed members of our community and students hav
 e responded by rising up. After the first citywide general strike in nearly
  a century\, ICE killed again. This violence has only strengthened the call
  from students in Minneapolis for people across the country to take action.
 \n\nBillionaires and politicians tell us we cannot afford free college or g
 ood jobs\, while they spend trillions on war\, oil profits\, and the kidnap
 ping of immigrants. Students know the truth: our futures are being sacrific
 ed to protect profit and power.\n\nAt this training\, you’ll learn how to u
 se communications to break through corporate media lies\, amplify student d
 emands\, and help build real pressure. We are here to prove that no politic
 ian can keep their job\, no school can operate as usual\, and no business c
 an turn a profit if they side with ICE’s violence over our communities.\n\n
 Join us to get the tools to fight back and help students rise up nationwide

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 iece of legislation that claims to address election integrity by requiring

 VE Act would make it harder for millions of Americans—especially students\,
  seniors\, and veterans—to vote by imposing strict documentation requiremen
 ts many eligible voters may struggle to meet. For example:\n\n* Students of
 ten move frequently for school or work and may not have updated IDs or proo
 f of citizenship readily available.\n* Seniors who no longer drive\, have e
 xpired IDs\, or live in assisted facilities may face challenges obtaining t
 he required documents.\n* Veterans who use military IDs (which don’t prove 
 citizenship) or have recently returned to civilian life may also encounter 
 barriers.\n* These groups\, along with naturalized citizens and low-income 
 individuals\, are disproportionately affected by such restrictions\, creati
 ng unnecessary obstacles to exercising their right to vote. This undermines
  democracy by silencing voices and discouraging participation.\n\nJoin Comm
 on Cause for an important phone bank as we mobilize voters to take action a
 gainst dangerous legislation in state houses around the country. We will fo
 cus on the most urgent campaigns that need our help. Some of these campaign
 s may include stopping bills that will make it harder for millions of Ameri
 cans—especially students\, seniors\, and veterans—to cast their ballots. We
  need your help to ensure voters across the country call their state repres
 entatives and demand they protect the freedom to vote.\n\nNo prior experien

 borhood schools. These corporations are already targeting neighborhood publ
 ic schools\, seizing public school buildings rent-free. (link to learn more
  somewhere in here)\n\n·      This rule further weakens our neighborhood sc
 hools\, stripping control from parents and school boards\, and draining muc
 h needed funding and resources our children need.\n \n📞 Join fellow advoca

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 E agents to our nation's cities\, we remain clear and centered on the follo
 wing truths:\n\n1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by st
 anding in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.\n2. Trump’s aggressive a
 nd violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communitie
 s to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.\n3. Listening-forw
 ard conversations that support people to reflect on their values\, feelings
  and experiences can shift their attitudes\, perspective and behavior.\n\nT
 hat's why we're channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can
  take with us.\n\n**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters abo
 ut their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in 
 the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House i
 n the 2026 elections.**\n\nTogether\, we can move the needle and build powe
 r.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources\,  trainin
 g and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical convers
 ations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s 
 commonsense beliefs around immigration policy\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/su

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b

 e our people.\n\nAs the Trump Administration continues to deploy violent IC
 E agents to our nation's cities\, we remain clear and centered on the follo
 wing truths:\n\n1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by st
 anding in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.\n2. Trump’s aggressive a
 nd violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communitie
 s to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.\n3. Listening-forw
 ard conversations that support people to reflect on their values\, feelings
  and experiences can shift their attitudes\, perspective and behavior.\n\nT
 hat's why we're channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can
  take with us.\n\n**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters abo
 ut their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in 
 the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House i
 n the 2026 elections.**\n\nTogether\, we can move the needle and build powe
 r.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources\,  trainin
 g and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical convers
 ations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s 
 commonsense beliefs around immigration policy\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/su

 to you by Right To Be\, in partnership with the NYC Commission on Gender Eq
 uity\, the Mayor’s Office of Equity and Racial Justice\, and the NYC Commis
 sion on Gender Equity\, will teach you Right To Be’s 5Ds of bystander inter
 vention methodology. We’ll start by talking about the types of disrespect t
 hat Muslims and those who are perceived to be Muslim are facing right now —
  from microaggressions to violence — using a tool we call the “spectrum of 
 disrespect.” You’ll learn what to look for and the positive impact that bys
 tander intervention has on individuals and communities. We’ll talk through 
 five strategies for intervention: distract\, delegate\, document\, delay\, 
 and direct\, and how to prioritize your own safety while intervening. We’ll
  have time at the end for practice\, and you’ll leave feeling more confiden
 t intervening the next time you see Islamophobic and xenophobic harassment 
 online or in person.

DESCRIPTION:Topic: Motherhood Live: The “Wine Mom" Label & Other Cons to Si
 lence Moms\nDescription: Apparently\, moms are the latest “threat” to Ameri
 ca.\n\nAccording to recent media narratives\, the real danger isn’t broken 
 systems or failed leadership. It’s “organized gangs of wine moms” — women w
 ho are standing up\, speaking out\, and refusing to stay quiet. It’s meant 
 to sound ridiculous. And it is. But it’s also deliberate.\n\nWhen women sho
 w up in public and refuse to be silent\, ridicule is always the first line 
 of attack. Labels are used to shrink us. Jokes are used to dismiss us. Pani
 c is manufactured to push us back into our place.\n\nBut we know better.\n\
 nJoin Reshma Saujani\, Ilana Glazer\, Emily Oster\, Anna Malaika Tubbs\, Gl
 oria Steinem\, Katie Bethell\, Shannon Watts and hundreds of other moms for
  a live conversation decoding the cons meant to shrink moms’ voices.\n\nThi
 s virtual event will leave you educated\, energized\, and ready to show up 
 anyway.\n\nRegister to save your spot.\n\nThis event is brought to you in p
 artnership with Moms First\, Culture House\, Gloria's Foundation\, the Mete
 or\, Mother Tongue\, Move On and WIE Suite. \n\nThis event is educational a
 nd nonpartisan. No political candidates or parties are endorsed or opposed.

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

 We’ll start by talking about the types of disrespect that people with disab
 ilities or those perceived to be with disabilities are facing right now — f
 rom microaggressions to violence — using a tool we call the “spectrum of di
 srespect.” You will learn what to look for and the positive impact that bys
 tander intervention has on individuals and communities. We’ll talk through 
 five strategies for intervention: distract\, delegate\, document\, delay\, 
 and direct\; and how to prioritize your own safety while intervening.<br><b
 r><br>We’ll have time at the end for practice\, and you’ll leave feeling mo
 re confident intervening the next time you see ableism or disability harass

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n

 EAL to Win School Board Campaign Training\nWhen: Mar 19\, 2026 07:00 PM Eas
 tern Time (US and Canada) \n\nRegister in advance for this meeting:\nhttps:
 //raceforward-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/Gzed0L12RAqL5TGHmLPvfQ \n\nAfter
  registering\, you will receive a confirmation email containing information
  about joining the meeting.\n\nIn recent years\, public schools and school 
 board meetings have become a central target for a growing authoritarian mov
 ement. These extremists are fomenting fear and division by contriving new c
 ontroversies around topics like book bans\, the rights of transgender stude
 nts\, and anti-"Critical Race Theory” attacks on curriculum. Thankfully\, p
 eople everywhere are standing up and fighting back. A counter-movement of c
 oncerned students\, parents\, educators\, and community members has arisen 
 organically in response to this growing authoritarian threat.\n\nRunning sc
 hool board candidates is an important way to fight for our children’s schoo
 ls\, and make sure every child can have a bright future. \n\nThat is why we
  need people like you everywhere to recruit\, support\, and elect leaders i
 n our communities who can serve as champions of public education as school 
 board members. \n\nWhether you're considering running yourself or supportin
 g someone else's campaign\, join this training to gain practical knowledge 
 about campaign essentials - from building an effective team to developing a
  winning field strategy to crafting messages that resonate with voters. \n\
 nThe training will also discuss how running a strong campaign can lay the g
 roundwork for "co-governance" - a transformative approach where elected off
 icials and community members collaborate to create lasting\, systemic chang
 e in our schools. \n\nThrough practical examples\, simple guidance\, and ac
 cess to additional resources\, you'll gain the confidence and clarity neede
 d to run effective school board campaigns to help build strong\, equitable 
 public schools that serve all students.\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/raceforw

 held belief that racial segregation in the United States was the result of 
 private choices or economic forces. Instead\, Rothstein documents how feder

 n through laws\, policies\, and court decisions\, and how those choices con

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-

 e our people.\n\nAs the Trump Administration continues to deploy violent IC
 E agents to our nation's cities\, we remain clear and centered on the follo
 wing truths:\n\n1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by st
 anding in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.\n2. Trump’s aggressive a
 nd violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communitie
 s to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.\n3. Listening-forw
 ard conversations that support people to reflect on their values\, feelings
  and experiences can shift their attitudes\, perspective and behavior.\n\nT
 hat's why we're channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can
  take with us.\n\n**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters abo
 ut their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in 
 the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House i
 n the 2026 elections.**\n\nTogether\, we can move the needle and build powe
 r.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources\,  trainin
 g and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical convers
 ations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s 
 commonsense beliefs around immigration policy\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/su

  livestream\n\nAcross the country\, authoritarian forces are getting bolder
  and more dangerous. Trump and his allies are not hiding their agenda: mass
  deportations\, rollbacks of civil rights\, weaponized courts\, and full-sc
 ale attacks on our democracy. We don’t have to wait until it’s too late. We
  can stop this. But it’ll take all of us—not just on single days of mass ac
 tion\, but through sustained organizing in our communities.\n\nThat’s why t
 his summer\, we’re launching One Million Rising—a national effort to train 
 one million people in the strategic logic and practice of non-cooperation\,
  as well as the basics of community organizing and campaign design. This is
  how we build people power that can’t be ignored. You’re invited to join us
 —and lead. \n\nLet’s build a force bigger than fear and louder than hate.  
 Let’s get ready. Let’s get organized. Let’s stop Trump.\n\n**Did you miss S

 ic campaign design and learn how to implement it locally as well as get plu
 gged into our next national campaign work. Your second community resistance
  gathering will move this action forward.\n\nSign up for all 3 sessions to 
 get the most out of this experience. Watch it live with a friend in person\

 the second and third sessions. This is how we get to 1 million!\n\n<a href=

 SBOE Co-Location Rules (Rule 6A-1.0998271)\, the so-called Schools of Hope

 ic schools\, seizing public school buildings rent-free. (link to learn more
  somewhere in here)\n\n·      This rule further weakens our neighborhood sc
 hools\, stripping control from parents and school boards\, and draining muc

  the racist lies aimed at winning over white people\, and instead chose to 
 stand in solidarity with her immigrant neighbors in the midst of the larges

 And– this is a time for those of us who are white to root in our commitment
 s to justice and continue to take risks and step into action. In the face o
 f intimidation and state repression we must stand resolute\, refuse to be i
 ntimidated\, and recommit to the fight against ICE and white supremacy ever
 ywhere.\n\nJoin us on Monday after the weekend of action for a space to gat
 her with other committed white folks\, hear from immigrant rights organizer
 s and folks on the ground in Minneapolis\, be in community in our grief\, f
 ear\, and anger\, and learn how you can move into action.\n\nShowing Up for

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

  the “spectrum of disrespect.” You’ll also learn a little bit about the imp

 or intervention: distract\, delegate\, document\, delay\, and direct\; and 
 how to prioritize your own safety while intervening.</p><p>Finally\, we’ll 
 practice intervening with a series of scenarios and close with a brief visi

DESCRIPTION:From Reconstruction to the present day\, Black political progre
 ss has repeatedly been met with organized backlash. The playbook hasn’t cha
 nged—question the candidate’s eligibility\, challenge their residency\, dis
 pute the vote count\, and cast doubt on their legitimacy.\n\nJoin us to hea
 r from Dr. James Ford\, an award-winning educator and the Executive Directo
 r of the Center for Racial Equity in Education (CREED)\, to learn how these
  same tactics are still being used today to try and weaken Black political 
 power and reverse hard-won gains. By understanding this history\, we can sp
 ot the patterns in real time\, call them out for what they are\, and stand 
 ready to defend democratic outcomes when Black candidates win and lead.\n\n

 wing truths:\n\n1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by st
 anding in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.\n2. Trump’s aggressive a
 nd violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communitie
 s to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.\n3. Listening-forw
 ard conversations that support people to reflect on their values\, feelings
  and experiences can shift their attitudes\, perspective and behavior.\n\nT
 hat's why we're channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can
  take with us.\n\n**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters abo
 ut their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in 
 the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House i
 n the 2026 elections.**\n\nTogether\, we can move the needle and build powe
 r.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources\,  trainin
 g and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical convers
 ations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s 
 commonsense beliefs around immigration policy\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/su

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 called them about. Urge 'em to vote yes or no on that bill or nomination. T
 hank them for standing strong when they do the right thing\, or ask them to
  fight for you when they wimp out.\n\nWhy? Because people will see your pos
 ts and make their own posts to their electeds! Winner winner chicken dinner

 ut.\n\nFinding all of your reps' handles on different social media platform
 s and creating posts is hard\, so we did it for you (on Facebook\, Instagra

 sts here: https://www.pleasegrowaspine.org/  \nPost personal messages to yo

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

 countability for the murder of Renee Good\, an end to federal funding for I
 CE\, and for businesses to cease economic relations with ICE. \n\n- Why the
 y’re calling on allies across the country to join them in a national week o

 and that corporate targets Target\, Delta\, Hilton\, Home Depot\, and Enter

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b

  for a Ground Truth phone bank—designed to fix what’s broken in Democratic 
 organizing. We’re launching an innovative new program that will revolutioni
 ze how we connect with voters over the phone. \n\nOur goal: to help Democra
 ts rebuild trust\, win tough races\, and flip the House. We're bringing peo
 ple together to build the community of real people\, having real conversati
 ons with real people. During Ground Truth phone banks\, we will talk to as 
 many people as possible and focus on listening. \n\nAt this phone bank\, we
 ’ll:\n\n- Call ALL types of voters -- not just those who vote like us.\n\n-
  Have real conversations that LISTEN deeply to voters’ concerns.\n\n- Gathe
 r insights to share with campaigns\, so they can be responsive to voters’ n
 eeds and smarter with their messaging\, targeting\, and outreach.\n\nDon’t 
 worry if it’s your first time—training\, materials\, and support are all pr
 ovided. Just come prepared with your phone and laptop or computer!\n\nWe re
 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a
  whole new way of talking to voters. Together\, we’ll gather authentic insi
 ghts from communities\, use cutting-edge tools to capture what we hear\, an
 d share it back with campaigns to strengthen their efforts.\n\nWhy we’re st
 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b
 eginning of the phone bank\, so don't worry if this is your first time.  \n
 \nPlease be sure to have your laptop/ computer charged and ready to go!\n\n
 See you there!\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/872281/

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 >\n\nThe onslaught of news\, the chaos coming out of the White House – it’s
  all meant to overwhelm us. It’s a deliberate strategy to sow confusion and
  make us believe we are powerless to fight back.\n\nThe antidote: Coming to
 gether in community to process what’s happening\, to sift through what’s im
 portant and what’s just noise\, and coalesce around strategies for fighting
  back.\n\nJoin Indivisible co-founders Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin each w

 antly – what’s the plan.\n\n<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://w

 d States is under growing threat. Rising premiums\, proposed cuts to the Af
 fordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid\, new work requirements\, and tighteni
 ng eligibility rules risk stripping coverage from millions.\n\nThis timely 
 webinar brings together healthcare advocates\, civil rights leaders\, commu
 nity organizers\, and frontline workers to unpack what’s coming and how we 
 prepare our communities through information\, coordination\, and action.\n\
 nParticipants will gain a clear understanding of the policy changes on the 
 horizon\, the real-world impacts on patients and providers\, and practical 
 strategies to protect access to care. The session will also focus on how co
 mmunities can organize\, educate\, and mobilize to push back against harmfu
 l cuts and defend healthcare as a human right.\n\nJoin from PC\, Mac\, iPad

 ederal Voucher Program\nDescription: The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" creat
 ed a federal tax credit voucher program that lets taxpayers contribute up t
 o $1\,700 annually to a Scholarship Granting Organization (SGO) in exchange
  for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit. The voucher scheme carries tremendous 
 risk for public education\, which may be compounded by forthcoming regulati

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 commend using earbuds or using speakerphone to free up your hands as well! 
 \n\n––\n\nAbout the program:\n\nThis isn’t traditional phone banking—it’s a

 arting early: We launched a year ahead of the midterms to build power befor
 e campaigns get off the ground.\n\nHow we’ll go big: Calling every voter\, 
 not just the ones we normally rely on\, so every conversation builds a more
  complete picture of the electorate.\n\nHow we’ll go deep: Practicing empat
 hetic listening and real conversations that uncover voters’ “Ground Truth\,
 ” not just checking boxes on a script.\n\nPaid for by Swing Left\, Swinglef
 t.org\, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.\n\nHow to
  prepare:\nThanks for signing up to join the Ground Truth phone banking pro
 gram! Together\, we can transform how we talk with voters\, rebuild trust\,
  and swing the most competitive races.\n\nThere will be a training at the b

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro
 gram. If you are over the age of 25 please sign up for the Brady Welcome Se

 review some new research on data centers.\n\n- Local groups fighting data c

 called them about. Urge 'em to vote yes or no on that bill or nomination. T
 hank them for standing strong when they do the right thing\, or ask them to
  fight for you when they wimp out.\n\nWhy? Because people will see your pos
 ts and make their own posts to their electeds! Winner winner chicken dinner

 lease join our virtual welcome session with this link\n\nAre you a young pe
 rson between 13 and 25 years old who is interested in taking action around 
 preventing gun violence? Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to lea
 rn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth
 -led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence an
 d mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady Un
 ited\, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance 
 our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council
 \, comprised of students just like us\, we believe that diversity is a stre
 ngth\, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an 
 effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor u
 s\, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms
  but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause th
 is form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You
  cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality\, wh
 ite supremacy\, the broken criminal justice system\, poverty\, homophobia\,
  access to affordable housing\, or the often barriers separating disadvanta
 ged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share th
 is belief\, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of 
 the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.\n\nHow to prepare:\nWe ar
 e excited to see you soon!\n\nP.S. This is a call for young people from 13-
 25 years old who are interested in getting engaged with the Team ENOUGH pro

 the Witch\, and the Sea. This is a fantasy novel about a pirate named Flora
  (disguised as Florian) and a highborn lady\, Evelyn\, who fall in love abo
 ard a ship where the crew plans to sell the passengers into slavery. Evelyn
  and Florian form an unlikely bond while the novel weaves magic\, betrayal\
 , romance\, and a daring escape that challenges oppressive power and rigid 
 societal roles. The story explores themes of colonialism\, gender identity\
 , and survival.The book has been challenged (and in some cases removed) fro
 m school and library collections primarily because it contains graphic viol
 ence\, sexual themes\, and LGBTQ+ content.

 itism that the Jewish community faces right now — from microaggressions to 
 violence — using a tool we call the\, “Spectrum of Disrespect.” You’ll lear
 n what to look for and the positive impact that bystander intervention has 
 on individuals and communities. We’ll talk through five strategies for inte
 rvention: distract\, delegate\, document\, delay\, and direct\; and how to 
 prioritize your own safety while intervening. We’ll have time at the end fo
 r practice\, and you’ll leave feeling more confident intervening the next t
 ime you see antisemitic harassment online or in person.</p><p> </p><p>This 
 training was made possible through initial support from the Auschwitz Pledg
 e Foundation and individual supporters</p>
