SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Removal (Monroe)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Union County Wildlife Chapter and community volunteers to remove invasive species along the Carolina Thread Trail at the Union County Agricultural Center. Invasive plants are non-native introduced plants that do not support native wildlife. They are very aggressive\, outcompete wildlife-friendly plants\, and take over natural areas. Removing invasive species is often the first step to enhancing and restoring habitat for wildlife. \nVolunteers will discover how to identify invasive plants and practice removing them by hand and with tools. Please bring your favorite pair of loppers\, pruning saw\, and a pair of gloves. We will have some tools available. Ages 13+ please. \nREGISTER HERE

SUMMARY:Voices Rising: Save Our Sounds (Greensboro)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Triad Wild! Chapter for a conversation about one of North Carolina’s most treasured natural resources: our estuarine sounds. Our sounds\, most notably the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound\, are known for their stunning coastal landscapes\, immense biodiversity\, historical significance\, economic importance\, and are the largest estuarine system in the nation managed by one state. Estuaries\, sometimes described as “rainforests of the sea”\, are crucial because they filter pollutants\, provide critical nurseries for fish and shellfish (supporting fisheries)\, as well as economic benefits through recreation\, tourism\, and jobs\, all while supporting immense biodiversity. Our shallow sounds are in deep trouble for several reasons\, not the least of which is our fisheries management. It’s not too late to recognize and to cherish North Carolina’s natural treasures for the gift they are and undertake-with dogged determination-the effort to restore their abundance\, for humans and the environment. Restoration is not a pipe dream; it is just waiting for us to get on board.  \nREGISTER HERE

SUMMARY:Morrow Mountain Winter Hikes (Albemarle)

SUMMARY:Invasive Plant Species Removal (Roper)
DESCRIPTION:Join NCWF Wildlife Habitat Stewards of Northeastern NC Chapter and Spruill Conservation Farm for a hands-on habitat restoration project on Saturday\, February 28\, from 10 am to 12 pm. Together\, volunteers will focus on removing invasive heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) along the farm’s wooded nature trail. \nHeavenly bamboo poses a threat to local ecosystems as it spreads quickly when birds eat its berries and disperse the seeds\, allowing dense thickets to form that crowd out native plants and reduce habitat quality for wildlife. Its berries are also highly toxic\, releasing cyanide when eaten\, and birds such as cedar waxwings have been known to die after consuming large quantities. \nThis volunteer effort will involve digging\, prying\, cutting\, and lifting plant roots\, so participants should be prepared for physical activity. It’s a great opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the trail and the wildlife that depends on it.\n \nREGISTER HERE

SUMMARY:Fox Creek Livestaking Workshop (Swannanoa)
DESCRIPTION:Swannanoa Valley WILD\, Friends of Fox Creek Park\, Swannanoa Community Council\, and WNC Grows are excited to announce a livestaking workshop at Fox Creek Park in Swannanoa. We’ve removed a significant portion of invasive kudzu along Fox Creek and now it’s time to replant with native species like silky dogwood\, ninebark\, and elderberry in an effort to control erosion and provide habitat for wildlife. Participants will learn how to use the livestaking technique on their own properties while helping us restore Fox Creek along the way. Participants will also receive a bundle of livestakes to take home with them free of charge! Special thanks to the Pigeon River Fund of the Community Foundation of WNC and National Wildlife Federation’s Trees For Wildlife Program for making this workday possible. \nREGISTER HERE
