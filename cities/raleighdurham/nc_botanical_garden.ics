SUMMARY:Photography Workshop: Winter Light in the Garden

Together\, we’ll explore how to photograph bare branches\, seed heads\, textures\, frost patterns\, muted palettes\, and the striking geometry that emerges when the garden rests. Through guided exercises and intentional seeing practices\, you’ll learn to work with low winter light\, embrace simplicity\, and create images that reflect the stillness and poetry of the season. Perfect for photographers who want to expand their visual awareness and find beauty in the subtle\, overlooked moments of winter. All cameras and lenses appropriate from smart phones to digital single lens reflex and mirrorless. \n  \nRegister Here
