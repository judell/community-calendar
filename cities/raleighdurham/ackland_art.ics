SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: “Aftersun” (Charlotte Wells\, 2022)
DESCRIPTION:Set during a modest holiday at a Turkish resort in the early 2000s\, Aftersun approaches coming of age obliquely\, through memory and retrospection. Stunningly shot on 35mm film\, which is contrasted with mini DV home movie video footage\, the plot follows young Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her father Calum (Paul Mescal). But it is the adult Sophie’s somber attempt to reconstruct this formative trip that gives the story its emotional charge. Coming of age here is not marked by clear lessons or dramatic turning points\, but by the gradual\, dawning recognition of a parent’s fragility—and of the limits of childhood understanding. \n  \nThe film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at the Chelsea Theater\, 1129 Weaver Dairy Road\, Suite AB\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514. Click here for more information on theater pricing; tickets are free for UNC-Chapel Hill students. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series:\nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.

SUMMARY:The 11th Annual Symposium of the Art Student Graduate Organization - “Anachronic Enchantment: Temporalities in Visual and Material Culture"
DESCRIPTION:The symposium will be held in-person at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday\, February 28 from 9:00 AM- 2:30 PM. Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and are open to a general audience. \nWhen something is described as anachronistic\, it is often to say that it is contradictory\, inconsistent\, illogical\, or misplaced. Essentially\, to be anachronistic is to exist outside of historical time. However\, has science not demonstrated that time is relative? Is temporality\, meaning our relationship with time\, not subject to change? Instead of anachronistic\, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood have coined the term anachronic to refer to art that has “witnessed time.” Art historian\, Keith Moxey\, adds that anachronicity is the ability of objects “to exceed the parameters of their chronological circumstances.” \nWith this in mind\, this symposium considers temporality as its central framework and invites interdisciplinary reflection on how time is constructed\, experienced\, and represented across humanistic study. By foregrounding temporal frameworks\, we seek to interrogate whose times are privileged\, silenced\, or contested\, and how alternative conceptions of time challenge dominant narratives. Central to this inquiry are questions that examine how artists have engaged with temporality to construct new and alternative histories; how meaning and interpretation inevitably shift across time\, requiring us to reconsider our own scholarly and curatorial practices; and how ephemeral forms of art disrupt and complicate traditional art historical methods.

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: "Boyhood" (Richard Linklater\, 2014)
DESCRIPTION:Filmed over twelve years with the same cast members who conspicuously age from segment to segment\, Boyhood offers one of cinema’s most literal and radical explorations of coming of age. Following Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from early childhood through his first days of college\, the film refuses traditional narrative climaxes in favor of accumulation: small moments\, shifting family dynamics\, and incremental changes in perception as time itself figures as the “main character.” Linklater’s method allows us to experience maturation as something lived\, uneven\, and quietly profound. \nThe film will be introduced by Rick Warner\, Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor and Director of Film Studies. \n  \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at The Lumina Theater (620 Market St\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27516). \nTickets are free for all audience members\, and registration is required via The Lumina’s webpage. Please click here to reserve your free ticket. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.

SUMMARY:Ackland Film Forum: "Crooklyn" (Spike Lee\, 1994)
DESCRIPTION:Set in 1970s Brooklyn\, Crooklyn recounts childhood from the perspective of nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris)\, whose coming of age unfolds within the rhythms of Black family life\, neighborhood culture\, and social constraint. The film balances warmth and humor with moments of rupture\, revealing how maturity often arrives through confrontation with authority\, injustice\, and grief. Lee presents growing up as both deeply personal and inseparable from place\, race\, and community—an education shaped as much by environment as by experience. \n  \nThe film will be introduced by Daelena Tinnin-Gadson\, Assistant Professor of Black Film Studies and African American Literature. \nThis film will be screened at 7:30 p.m. at the Varsity Theatre (123 East Franklin Street\, Chapel Hill\, NC 27514). Tickets are free\, but must be reserved on the Ackland’s webpage. Register below. UNC-Chapel Hill students can receive CLE credit for attending by scanning the QR code at the event. \n  \nAbout the Series: \nJoin the Ackland Film Forum this spring for Growing Up\, Looking Back\, a series that accompanies the Ackland exhibition Bill Bamberger: Boys Will Be Men. This semester’s series highlights the filmgoing experience by using three local movie theaters as its venues. \nThe Ackland Film Forum is co-organized by the Ackland Art Museum and UNC Film Studies\, housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.
