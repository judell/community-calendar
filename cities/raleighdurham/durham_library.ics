SUMMARY:Attention Span Rehab
DESCRIPTION:Found yourself unable to focus? Constantly switching between 
 tasks (getting nothing done)\, or unable to focus on one task (getting 
 things done\, but incorrectly)? In 2004\, the average attention span was 
 2.5 minutes. Today\, the American Psychological Association estimates that 
 it's around 47 seconds. Lack of attention span has been attributed to 
 stress\, increased errors\, and slower performance. Plus\, it can just make 
 life feel really overwhelming.\n\nSo\, give your brain a break! Join us for 
 a phone free hour of reading\, coloring\, brain teasers\, quiet 
 conversation\, and more\, and take back your attention! Registration is 
 encouraged but not required!\n\nNote: Patrons will have the option to place 
 their mobile device(s) in a zippered container that will be kept in the 
 room and monitored by the librarian. Spots are limited. The Library cannot 
 assume liability for any lost or stolen items. If patrons choose to keep 
 their phone on their person\, they are asked to not use it in the room 
 during the program.

 This is a Young Adult book club recommended for teens ages 14 to 18 and new 
 adults 18-24 to read\, discuss\, and paint as we talk about what we like\, 
 love\, and hate about our books.\n\nThis month\, we are reading THE 
 ALCHEMYST by Michael Scott.  Synopsis: The truth: Nicholas Flamel's tomb is 
 empty.  The legend: Nicholas Flamel lives.  Nicholas Flamel is the greatest 
 Alchemyst to ever live. The records show that he died in 1418\, but what if 
 he's actually been making the elixir of life for centuries?  The secrets to 
 eternal life are hidden within the book he protects--the Book of Abraham 
 the Mage. It's the most powerful book that has ever existed\, and in the 
 wrong hands\, it will destroy the world. And that's exactly what Dr. John 
 Dee plans to do when he steals it.  There is one hope. If the prophecy is 
 true\, Sophie and Josh Newman have the power to save everyone. Now they 
 just have to learn to use it.

SUMMARY:The Ethics of Now: On The Causes of Gun Violence and How To Prevent It
DESCRIPTION:Join the Kenan Institute for Ethics and host Adriane 
 Lentz-Smith for a conversation with University of Chicago professor and 
 Crime Lab director Jens Ludwig on the causes of gun violence — and the 
 policy changes that can help us prevent it.\n\nJens Ludwig uses behavioral 
 economics and data science to understand why people commit crimes. In his 
 most recent book\, “Unforgiving Places: The Unexpected Origins of 
 American Gun Violence\,” Ludwig writes that gun violence isn’t just a 
 burden our society must bear — it’s a problem that we can actually 
 solve. \n\nWith insights informed by decades of research and fieldwork in 
 the South Side of Chicago\, Ludwig discovers that most shootings happen in 
 the heat of the moment\, driven more by circumstances than by calculation. 
 He argues that finding ways to intervene in the “unforgiving places” 
 that spur gun violence could effectively stop crimes before they happen\, 
 giving both potential victims and potential perpetrators another chance at 
 life.\n\nJens Ludwig is a behavioral economist and Edwin A. and Betty L. 
 Bergman Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago. His 
 current work focuses on how behavioral science and data science can help 
 solve social problems\, particularly in the areas of urban poverty\, 
 crime\, and education. He helped found the Crime Lab and the Education Lab 
 at the University of Chicago to work closely with government agencies to 
 turn these insights into social change out in the real world. The lab 
 projects include working with the Chicago Police Department to implement 
 data-driven management changes that helped substantially reduce gun 
 violence without increasing arrests\, and partnering with the Mayor’s 
 Office in New York City to help build and implement a new pretrial risk 
 tool as part of the city’s goal to close Riker’s Island. \n\nLudwig 
 received his BA in economics from Rutgers College and his MA and PhD in 
 economics from Duke University. He continues to collaborate with his 
 advisor and friend from Duke\, Sanford School Emeritus Professor of Public 
 Policy Phil Cook. Together they coauthored “Violence: The Real Costs” 
 (Oxford University Press\, 2000)\, and coedited “Evaluating Gun Policy” 
 (Brookings Institution Press\, 2003). He coedited “Controlling Crime: 
 Strategies and Tradeoff” (University of Chicago Press\, 2012) with Cook 
 and Justin McCray. “Unforgiving Places: The Unexpected Origins of 
 American Gun Violence” (University of Chicago Press\, 2025) is his most 
 recent book.\n\nThis event takes place at the Durham County Main Library. A 
 reception and book signing will follow the event. Copies of “Unforgiving 
 Places” will be available for purchase\, courtesy of the Regulator 
 Bookshop.\n\nPlease be advised that seating for this event is first come\, 
 first served.

DESCRIPTION:RESCHEDULED TO MONDAY MARCH 9TH\n\nREGISTER 
 HERE:\n\nOPOSSUMS!\n\n \n\nOPOSSUMS! \n\nWho? What? Where? When? Why? \n\n 
 \n\n\n\nToo cold for rabies... \n\nAble to survive venomous snake bites... 
 \n\nNorth America’s only marsupial... \n\nHairless prehensile tails... 
 \n\n50 teeth... \n\n \n\n\n\nWho are these Jack’s\, Jill’s\, and 
 Joey’s of the night? What kind of food do they eat? Where can you find 
 them during the day? Why do they play possum? When do they groom 
 themselves?  \n\n\n\nJoin Linda Veraldi\, Wildlife Rehabber with Wildlife 
 Welfare Inc.\, to learn more about these misunderstood North American 
 marsupials!  \n\n \n\n\n\nLinda Veraldi is a devoted wildlife 
 rehabilitator\, with a special focus on the often-misunderstood\, 
 always-adorable Virginia opossum. Beyond hands-on care\, she is passionate 
 about sharing her knowledge—mentoring and training new rehabbers to 
 ensure the next generation of animal lovers continues the mission with 
 compassion and skill. She also educates the public about wildlife\, 
 encouraging understanding and empathy\, and helping people see that finding 
 an animal in your yard is an honor and thrill\, not a nuisance\, especially 
 as natural habitats disappear. \n\nHer home is a quiet sanctuary where tiny 
 orphan joeys or injured adults find warmth\, safety\, and meticulous care. 
 Her rehab space hums with gentle routines\, careful feeding schedules\, and 
 a whole lot of love. \n\nOutside of wildlife work\, Linda is a proud mom of 
 two grown children\, happily married for 43 years\, and shares her life 
 with her beloved foster-fail dog\, Ava\, who keeps a respectful watch over 
 all animal care. She also tends to her backyard flock of three chickens and 
 one duck\, enjoying fresh eggs every morning. During the winter months\, 
 when wildlife rehab slows\, she lends her nurturing touch to bottle baby 
 puppy rescues\, often feeding newborn puppies at all hours of the night. 
 \n\nWhen she steps away from the critters\, you’ll find Linda on the 
 pickleball court\, bringing the same focus\, energy\, and perseverance she 
 brings to every animal she cares for. For Linda\, life is about following 
 your heart\, pursuing your passions\, and making a meaningful difference 
 wherever you can. \n\n \n\n\n\nWildlife Welfare\, Inc.\, a 501(c)(3) 
 wildlife rehabilitation organization founded in 1991. We are a passionate 
 group of rehabbers from across the Triangle area\, dedicated to caring for 
 non-rabies vector species such as opossums\, squirrels\, bunnies\, mice\, 
 voles\, and more. You can learn more about us at wildlifewelfare.org. 
 \n\nWe welcome new rehabbers and provide full training\, mentorship\, and 
 guidance in all aspects of wildlife rehabilitation. If directly caring for 
 animals isn’t something you’re able to do\, you can still play a vital 
 role as a transporter. Transporters help move animals safely from point A 
 to point B—whether it’s from a veterinarian to a rehabber\, from a 
 finder to a rehabber\, or other scenarios. No prior animal care experience 
 is necessary—just your time\, a vehicle\, and a willingness to help! \n\n 
 \n\n\n\nTuesday January 27th starting at 6 p.m. in the Durham County Main 
 Library located at 300 North Roxboro Street in Durham.  \n\nThere will be 
 no live animals at this event.\n\nParking is available in the library 
 parking lot or at the North Queen Street Garage located at 115 North Queen

 right\, pursuing high stakes self-improvement\, such as who we marry\, how 
 to date\, where to live\, what makes us happy\, based solely on what our 
 gut instinct tells us. But what if our gut is wrong? Biased\, 
 unpredictable\, and misinformed\, our gut\, it turns out\, is not all that 
 reliable. And data can prove this.\n\nIn Don’t Trust Your Gut\, 
 economist\, former Google data scientist\, and New York Times bestselling 
 author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz reveals just how wrong we really are when 
 it comes to improving our own lives. In the past decade\, scholars have 
 mined enormous datasets to find remarkable new approaches to life’s 
 biggest self-help puzzles. Data from hundreds of thousands of dating 
 profiles have revealed surprising successful strategies to get a date\; 
 data from hundreds of millions of tax records have uncovered the best 
 places to raise children\; data from millions of career trajectories have 
 found previously unknown reasons why some rise to the top.\n\nTelling 
 fascinating\, unexpected stories with these numbers and the latest big data 
 research\, Stephens-Davidowitz exposes that\, while we often think we know 
 how to better ourselves\, the numbers disagree. Hard facts and figures 
 consistently contradict our instincts and demonstrate self-help that 
 actually works\, whether it involves the best time in life to start a 
 business or how happy it actually makes us to skip a friend’s birthday 
 party for a night of Netflix on the couch. From the boring careers that 
 produce the most wealth\, to the old-school\, data-backed relationship 
 advice so well-worn it’s become a literal joke\, he unearths the 
 startling conclusions that the right data can teach us about who we are and 
 what will make our lives better.\n\nLively\, engrossing\, and provocative\, 
 the end result opens up a new world of self-improvement made possible with 
 massive troves of data. Packed with fresh\, entertaining insights\, Don’t 
 Trust Your Gut redefines how to tackle our most consequential choices\, one 
 that hacks the market inefficiencies of life and leads us to make smarter 
 decisions about how to improve our lives. Because in the end\, the numbers 
 don’t lie.\n\n \n\nBring your questions\, observations\, and reflections!

 family\, possessions\, even her name. She is now known only as Arha\, the 
 Eaten One\, and guards the shadowy\, labyrinthine Tombs of Atuan.\nThen a 
 wizard\, Ged Sparrowhawk\, comes to steal the Tombs’ greatest hidden 
 treasure\, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe. Tenar’s duty is to protect the Ring\, 
 but Ged possesses the light of magic and tales of a world that Tenar has 
 never known. Will Tenar risk everything to escape from the darkness that 
 has become her domain?"

SUMMARY:Paint What You Hear - A Musical and Artistic Relaxation Program
DESCRIPTION:Let the music move your brush. Paint What You Hear with DJ Drew 
 is a laid-back\, immersive creative experience where sound becomes art. As 
 DJ Drew spins a curated mix of songs across genres and moods\, participants 
 are invited to paint freely—responding to rhythm\, lyrics\, tempo\, and 
 emotion in real time.\n\nThere’s no right or wrong way to create here. 
 Whether you’re inspired by a heavy bassline\, a soulful hook\, or a 
 nostalgic lyric\, this program encourages self-expression\, mindfulness\, 
 and connection through music and visual art. All skill levels are 
 welcome—come to vibe\, experiment\, and let the music guide your 
 creativity.\n\nPerfect for anyone looking to unwind\, tap into their 
 artistic side\, and experience music in a whole new way. No pressure. No 
 expectations. Just paint what you hear.\n\nAll painting supplies are 
 provided!

SUMMARY:Mystery Book Club -- THE VIOLIN CONSPIRACY
DESCRIPTION:Join us virtually\, or in person\, this month to discuss The 
 Violin Conspiracy by Brendan Slocumb.\n\nRay McMillian loves playing the 
 violin more than anything\, and nothing will stop him from pursuing his 
 dream of becoming a professional musician. Not his mother\, who thinks he 
 should get a real job\, not the fact that he can't afford a high-caliber 
 violin\, not the racism inherent in the classical music world. And when he 
 makes the startling discovery that his great-grandfather's fiddle is 
 actually a priceless Stradivarius\, his star begins to rise.\n\nThen with 
 the international Tchaikovsky Competition - the Olympics of classical music 
 - fast approaching\, his prized family heirloom is stolen. Ray is 
 determined to get it back. But now his family and the descendants of the 
 man who once enslaved Ray's great-grandfather are each claiming that the 
 violin belongs to them. With the odds stacked against him and the pressure 
 mounting\, will Ray ever see his beloved violin again?\n\nBooks are 
 available in the following formats: physical copy\, Libby audiobook\, & 
 Libby e-book. There will be physical copies available at the North Regional 
 Information Desk for anyone that is interested.  Registration is required 
 to receive the Zoom link to attend the event.\n\nE-mail Bob with any 
 questions: rskesler@dconc.gov.

SUMMARY:Stay Focused -- Slow Down
DESCRIPTION:Dear Mr. & Mrs. Jones\,\n\nI am writing to inform you of my 
 withdrawal from the race to keep up with you. It has come to my attention 
 that prolonged attempts to compete with you have been detrimental to my 
 health\, my bank account\, my self-confidence\, and my ability to feel 
 content. This is a price I am no longer willing to pay.\n\nYours 
 sincerely\, Brooke\n\nThese words of Brooke McAlary will guide this month's 
 session on slowing down. There are many advantages to adopting a slower 
 pace in our daily life\, including stress reduction and enhanced mental 
 clarity. We'll swap ideas and strategies for counteracting society's demand 
 for constant speed\, and we'll wrap up with a couple of activities to help 
 improve focus and calm the mind.\n\nClick here for a list of library books 
 on this topic.\n\nE-mail Bob with any questions: rskesler@dconc.gov

SUMMARY:Daytime Book Club: Kindred
DESCRIPTION:Come join the Daytime Book Club as we discuss this month's 
 book! New members are always welcome (we love meeting new people!). 
 Registration is appreciated but not required.\n\nThis month we will discuss 
 Kindred by Octavia Butler. The description for the book is 
 below:\n"Butler's most celebrated\, critically acclaimed work tells the 
 story of Dana\, a young black woman who is suddenly and inexplicably 
 transported from her home in 1970s California to the pre-Civil War South. 
 As she time-travels between worlds\, one in which she is a free woman and 
 one where she is part of her own complicated familial history on a southern 
 plantation\, she becomes frighteningly entangled in the lives of Rufus\, a 
 conflicted white slaveholder and one of Dana's own ancestors\, and the many 
 people who are enslaved by him. Kindred is held up as an essential work in 
 feminist\, science-fiction\, and fantasy genres\, and a cornerstone of the 
 Afrofuturism movement. The intersectionality of race\, history\, and the 
 treatment of women addressed within the original work remain critical 
 topics in contemporary dialogue\, both in the classroom and in the public 
 sphere. Frightening\, compelling\, and richly imagined\, Kindred offers an 
 unflinching look at our complicated social history."\n\nWe look forward to 
 seeing you all soon!\n\n\nInterested in attending a future Daytime Book 
 Club meeting? Take a look at our reading list below:\n\nFebruary 11\, 2026: 
 Kindred by Octavia Butler\n\nMarch 11\, 2026: An Immense World by Ed 
 Yong\n\nApril 15\, 2026: The God of the Woods by Liz Moore\n\n
