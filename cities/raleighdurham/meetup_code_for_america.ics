SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit

SUMMARY:Civic Hacking for Affordable Housing
DESCRIPTION:Code with the Carolinas - Triangle\nJoin volunteers at Code wi
 th the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoning
 atlas.org/) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their 
 nationwide zoning atlas. "The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key asp
 ects of zoning codes in an online\, user-friendly map." The Atlas aims to 
 provide data for better solutions in transportation\, environmental\, and 
 especially affordable housing policy.\n\nAffordable housing proponents hav
 e long recognized zoning policies as barriers to affordable housing. To im
 prove zoning policies\, we first need to better understand the current sta
 te of zoning across the United States. Code with the Carolinas is helping 
 this cause by joining the National Zoning Atlas to gather zoning data for 
 North and South Carolina.\n\nThis is a multi-dimensional project grounded 
 in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influenti
 al dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search a
 nd integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occa
 sional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about
  machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the 
 NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to 
 the foundations of civic data science\, with a focus on GIS data.\n\nEven 
 if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering\, you're welc
 ome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skil
 ls are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspac
 e](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x
 -3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel.\n\nMeetings
  start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal ori
 entation\, often in a breakout room\, while experienced volunteers get rig
 ht to work. By the end of the session\, both groups of volunteers are work
 ing together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work 
 and informal work sessions.\n\nMeetings are on the Jitsi platform and the 
 link is provided before each meeting. If you will be joining on mobile\, i
 nstall the Jitsi app in advance [https://jitsi.org/downloads/](https://jit
