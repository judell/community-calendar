SUMMARY:Travel CHINA like a local! Virtual QnA [x-posted]
DESCRIPTION:Raleigh & Triangle Activities Meetup Group\nPutting out feeler
 s for curious\, cooperative 'comrades' to explore quiet corners of Old Cat
 hay! Trip date TBD - waiting for airfares to come down.\n\nThis will happe
 n on Google Meet.\n\n**CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR MEETING LINK!**\n\n[Comment 
 if you are able to log onto the link but don't see me - in the past Google
  has let two meetings with the same link open\, each person thinking the o
 ther didn't show up. So comment here and we'll see if we can fix it. :-) ]
 \n\nI've been traveling to China for 27 years. Join me for a unique\, off 
 the beaten track culture immersion adventure!\n\nComfort NOT guaranteed! L
 OTS of walking! This trip is NOT for everyone but everyone who has come wi
 th me so far has LOVED it!\n\nItinerary NOT guaranteed so as to maximize e
 xperience! Spontaneous private zheng concert in a riverside pavilion? Let'
 s stop and enjoy! Weather is forecast to be rain in the mountains? Let's g
 o to the ancient village instead.\n\nCosts currently unknown but should be
  under $100/day for ALL in-country necessities: food\, lodging\, entrance 
 fees\, ground transport. Whatever price I end up quoting will NOT include 
 transport to/from China\, alcohol\, upgrades to lodging\\*\, upgrades to i
 n-country transport\\*.\n\nYou can do it cheaper with a big box tour. If s
 trict time schedules\, overpriced shopping\, industrial restaurant food\, 
 and being kept away from locals is good enough for you than that's your be
 st bet. If unique\, real China\, great food\, insider knowledge with eye f
 or western comforts\\*\\*\, and turn on a dime\\*\\*\\* [a mao?] escapades
  are for you than come with me!\n\nOnly seven people! Small and 'nimble'\\
 *\\*\\*!\n\nHave you already been to China? Already have seen the Forbidde
 n City and Great Wall? No worries! Big box tours do NOT go where I go!\n\n
 Have you never been to China and NEED to see the big sights? No problem! I
  can create an optional 3 day add-on for the Great Wall\, Forbidden City\,
  Temple of Heaven\, and other Beijing highlights. AND I can take you to hi
 dden gems few big tours touch.\n\nLet's dialog! Looking for like minded pe
 ople so everyone's on the same page. Don't want to put hard-core shoppers 
 with shop-hating history buffs\, or long distance hikers with casual strol
 lers. Just a more practical way to go. If enough interest I can lead TWO t
 rips\, each with its own emphasis. I reserve the right to group/accept/den
 y as I see fit. [I only want happiness! Sometimes that means saying 'maybe
  next time'.]\n\nGo to Jan Tu Tours on FB and browse the photo albums to g

 very quickly.\n\n\\*Where available - LOTS of things NOT available off the
