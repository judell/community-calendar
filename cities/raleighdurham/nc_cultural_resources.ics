DESCRIPTION:Join the Chatham County Historical Association for The Regulato
 r Movement and the Revolution in the North Carolina Backcountry on Sun\, Fe
 b 1\, 2pm-3:30pm. Carole Troxler\, Professor Emerita at Elon University\, w
 ill discuss the years leading up to the American Revolution\, in which yeom
 an farmers in North Carolina’s Piedmont farmland became increasingly angry 
 about the corruption and dishonesty among the colonial officials who collec
 ted their taxes and enforced their laws. A wave of popular support for stri
 cter regulation of these laws slowly spread throughout the Piedmont\, resul
 ting in years of minor clashes between the farmer ‘Regulators’ and the roya
 l militia. Although the militia finally defeated the Regulators at the Batt
 le of Alamance in 1771\, the seeds of revolt were planted. This little-know
 n rebellion in North Carolina highlighted the growing discontent among Amer
 ican colonists with colonial rule and helped set the stage for the American
  Revolution.\n\nThis event takes place indoors. The Chatham County Historic
  Courthouse and Museum is ADA-accessible. No pets allowed. Please leave you
 r furry friends at home. Free parking is available behind the courthouse an
 d along Hillsboro Street.\n\nThis event is part of our Chatham Celebrates A
 merica 250 initiative. See more America 250 events. See more events hosted

 \, and filtering water are viewed as uneccessary and little more than a par
 ty trick\, but during the colonial era (and up until somewhat recently) thi
 s was basic knowledge and often required for survival. For this program we 
 will take a look at some of the skills needed to survive as a soldier in th
 e revolutionary era\, some of the tactics they used\, and some of the suppl
 ies they carried. Come on out and experience a little bit of American histo
 ry. \n\nThis program is intended to be an outdoor program\, about 30 minute

DESCRIPTION:In honor of Black History Month\, visit Stagville on February 7
  for FREE guided tours exploring the history of slavery\, freedom\, and res
 istance in North Carolina. Stagville's land and buildings reveal powerful s
 tories of slavery and freedom. As you visit the site for Black History Mont
 h\, we invite you to remember the enslaved and emancipated people who shape
 d Stagville and North Carolina. \n\nOn Saturday\, February 7\, 2026\, free 
 guided tours will be offered to the public at:\n\n11 am1 pm3 pmGuided tours
  last about 75-90 minutes\, and include outdoor walking and driving. No res
 ervations are required! Check in at the Stagville visitors center to join a
  scheduled tour. \n\nHistoric Stagville preserves a section of the Bennehan
  and Cameron plantations\, one of the largest sites of plantation slavery i
 n antebellum North Carolina. Here\, enslaved people built a sprawling plant
 ation complex of farms\, workshops\, mansions\, and mills. Year after year 
 enslaved families suffered separation\, violence\, hard labor\, and disease
 . Amid the horrors of slavery\, they resisted\, claiming some measure of fr
 eedom through sabotage\, direct action\, cultural traditions\, and freedom 
 seeking. In 1864\, over 1\,000 people were enslaved by the Cameron and Benn
 ehan heirs. \n\nToday\, Historic Stagville is a 165-acre State Historic Sit
 e that inspires new understanding about the history of slavery through pres
 ervation\, interpretation\, research\, genealogy\, and descendant engagemen
 t.

DESCRIPTION:This presentation places James K. Polk into the larger context 
 of U.S.-Mexican relations\, and\, most specifically\, his role in the U.S.-
 Mexican War (1846-1848)\, which led to the loss of half of Mexico's territo
 ry and\, indirectly\, to a heightening of the sectional conflict in the Uni
 ted States that led to the Civil War. Buchenau will especially focus on Mex
 ico's perspective on Polk's war (and the U.S. more generally) but also inco
 rporate Indigenous agency into what was far more complex than a bilateral c
 onflict. \n\nJurgen Buchenau is the Dowd Term Chair of Capitalism Studies a
 nd Professor of History and Latin American Studies at UNC Charlotte. He ear
 ned his Ph.D. in History at UNC-Chapel Hill in 1993. His research interests
  include modern Mexico\, and especially political culture\, immigration\, i
 nternational history\, foreign travel writing\, and the Mexican Revolution.
  His teaching interests feature the history of capitalism\, U.S. foreign re
 lations\, and Latin American history. He is the author\, co-author\, and co
 -editor of thirteen books\, including In the Shadow of the Giant: The Makin
 g of Mexico’s Central America Policy (1996)\; Tools of Progress: A German M
 erchant Family in Mexico City\, 1865-Present (2004)\; Plutarco Elías Calles
  and the Mexican Revolution (2007)\; Mexico\, The Once and Future Revolutio
 n (2013\, with Gilbert M. Joseph)\; and The Sonoran Dynasty in Mexico: Revo
 lution\, Reforms\, and Repression (2023)\, and The United States and Mexico
 : Unequal Neighbors (in press). He has received grants and fellowships from
  the National Endowment of the Humanities\, the American Philosophical Soci
 ety\, the U.S. Department of Education\, and the German Academic Exchange S
 ervice\, among many others. Buchenau teaches classes on modern Latin Americ
 a\, U.S.-Latin American relations\, and the history of capitalism.

DESCRIPTION:Utilizing tools\, materials\, and printmaking techniques in the
  same fashion as Rembrandt\, participants create printed works inspired by 
 vintage Valentine’s Day greetings. \n\nAfter a brief discussion of the hist
 ory of printmaking\, we begin by looking at source material before selectin
 g an image to transfer to our copper plates. Using our transfer as a guide\
 , we then work directly on the copper with scribes in an intaglio printmaki
 ng technique known as drypoint. \n\nOnce we’ve spent time working on our pl
 ates\, we learn how to ink and print it on a traditional etching press\, ju
 st as prints were made centuries ago. With this approach\, we can combine t
 he immediacy of drawing with the ability to print many impressions. \n\nThi
 s is a class for artists and art enthusiasts of all levels\, no experience 
 required. Imagery and all supplies are included. All participants need to c
 ome with is an open mind and willingness to get a little inky. \n\n \n\nTic

DESCRIPTION:Sticking with that resolution to shrink the waistline? This ful
 l body workout mimicking animal movements can help. The first 5-10 minutes 
 will focus on stretching and warming up our muscle groups. This will be fol
 lowed by 10 minutes of body movement practice leading into a 20-minute circ
 uit of those learned movements\, known as an AMRAP (as many rounds/reps as 
 possible). We’ll end with a 10-minute cool down. This will be physically ch
 allenging\, but movements can be modified. Meet in the open lawn near the V
 isitor’s Center. Program is weather dependent.

DESCRIPTION:Echoes of Change: Resilience Against Oppression Walking Tour ex
 plores the NC State Capitol and NC Freedom Park as sites of resistance in N
 orth Carolina by examining how physical spaces and the people connected to 
 them have shaped struggles for justice in the 20th century.\n\nAt the NC St
 ate Capitol\, we will consider the building in two ways: first\, as a physi
 cal space where acts of resistance and demonstrations unfolded\, and second
 \, as a workplace for individuals whose policies and decisions sparked oppo
 sition and activism.\n\nThe program will also explore NC Freedom Park as a 
 space born directly out of the need for progress. Through the stories of in
 dividuals such as Julius Chambers\, Ella Baker\, and Golden Frinks\, we wil
 l highlight how people—not just places—drove transformative change. By cent
 ering individual acts of resistance\, this event underscores how collective
  action and courageous leadership have shaped North Carolina’s history and 
 continue to influence its present.\n\nThis tour is partially outdoors and r
 equires walking about a block to the NC State Capitol. Please dress comfort
 ably for the weather.

 plores the NC State Capitol and NC Freedom Park as sites of resistance in N

 them have shaped struggles for justice in the 20th century.\n\nAt the NC St

 cal space where acts of resistance and demonstrations unfolded\, and second
 \, as a workplace for individuals whose policies and decisions sparked oppo
 sition and activism.\n\nThe program will also explore NC Freedom Park as a 
 space born directly out of the need for progress. Through the stories of in
 dividuals such as Julius Chambers\, Ella Baker\, and Golden Frinks\, we wil
 l highlight how people—not just places—drove transformative change. By cent
 ering individual acts of resistance\, this event underscores how collective
  action and courageous leadership have shaped North Carolina’s history and 
 continue to influence its present.\n\nThis tour is partially outdoors and r
 equires walking about a block to the NC State Capitol. Please dress comfort
 ably for the weather.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for Rivers and Resistance: Freedom Seeking in Eastern N
 C\, a transformative\, place-based workshop designed for middle and high sc
 hool teachers.\n\n·       Virtual Event Kick Off (via Zoom) on Thursday\, M
 arch 26 (5 PM - 7:30 PM)\n·       Immersive Learning in Eastern NC Friday\,
  April 10 - Sunday\, April 12\, 2026  \n \nAPPLICATION DEADLINE is February
  22\n \nEvent Overview\nThroughout North Carolina's early history\, many en
 slaved people carved out freedom for themselves\, some using the waterways\
 , swamps\, and diverse landscapes of eastern North Carolina as pathways to 
 liberation. This immersive weekend experience will highlight the courageous
  acts of resistance and resilience by those who escaped or aided others in 
 their journey to freedom.\n \nParticipants will explore the historical sign
 ificance of key sites\, including DNCR's Somerset Place and Historic Edento
 n\, delving into the stories of enslaved people like Harriet Jacobs and man
 y others. Through interaction with top scholars\, tours\, discussions\, and
  hands-on activities\, the workshop will weave together history and science
 \, connecting the natural ecology of the region—its rivers\, swamps\, and f
 orests—with the survival strategies of freedom seekers.\n \nAttendees will 
 also have the unique opportunity to canoe the very waterways enslaved peopl
 e navigated\, offering an immersive experience in the natural environment t
 hat shaped their journeys. Guided by DNCR's NC Museum of Natural Sciences\,
  teachers will gain insights into the region’s ecosystems and learn how wat
 erways and landscapes influenced the history\, culture and experiences of f
 reedom seekers. \n\nIn addition to examining the physical landscapes of res
 istance\, we will explore cultural strategies of survival and freedom\, suc
 h as the role of foodways in sustaining communities. We will be joined by A
 dé Carrena\, an award-winning chef\, culinary artist\, storyteller\, and fi
 lmmaker\, who will guide us through the rich tapestry of Southern culinary 
 traditions and their deep roots in African diasporic culture. As she leads 
 our group in preparing a shared meal\, participants will experience firstha
 nd how recipes became vessels of memory and resilience.\n\nEqually powerful
  is the role of music and spirituals\, songs that served as both comfort an
 d covert communication\, embedding directions and encouragement within thei
 r melodies. Acclaimed scholar and singer Mary D. Williams will join us for 
 a private performance sharing some of the spirituals that were a source of 
 strength through generations. These cultural practices were not mere expres
 sions of creativity\; they were acts of quiet defiance\, sustaining hope an
 d forging pathways to liberation.\n \nTeachers will leave with new perspect
 ives on integrating history\, culture\, science\, and nature into comprehen
 sive lessons\, as well as strategies for teaching the history of slavery an
 d freedom seeking in effective and responsible ways.\n \nAttending educator

 the art of crafting handmade dolls that replicate the ones enslaved women w
 ould have created for their own children. As Ms. Joyner states\, " “Hand se
 wing is becoming a dying art\, but there are many benefits to the art form.
   You’re using your hands and eyes in coordination\, which is great practic
 e for other activities. You’re also working on fine motor skills\, which ca
 n be helpful for tasks like handwriting and using a computer mouse.  But th
 e best thing about hand sewing is that it’s a relaxing activity. When you’r
 e focusing on the task at hand\, you can forget about all of your troubles 
 and just enjoy the moment. Sometimes it’s nice to take a break from thinkin
 g about things and just work on something creative.  So let’s learn how to 
 create a handmade doll similar to the primitive dolls made by the enslaved 
 women of Colonial Williamsburg.” \n\nThe activity will take place in Roseda
 le's kitchen cellar\, and seating is limited to 15. Materials will be provi
 ded.

DESCRIPTION:The history of how the Declaration of Independence came to be i
 s familiar to many Americans.\nLess familiar and equally important is the s
 ubsequent history of the document. How did the Declaration go from being a 
 congressional PR document of moderate significance to becoming the defining
  document of American history and one of the most influential documents in 
 the history of the world.\n\nThough it served an important purpose in 1776\
 , the Declaration was not particularly noted or celebrated in the decades a
 fter the Revolution.\n\nIn this talk\, historian Michael D. Hattem will dis
 cuss how groups from across the political spectrum have redefined the Decla
 ration and its ideals in an effort to make them more relevant and meaningfu
 l to their own times. In the process\, he will show how the Declaration bec
 ame "American Scripture\," as well as a model for independence-seeking peop
 le around the world.

DESCRIPTION:The history of how the Declaration of Independence came to be i
 s familiar to many Americans. Less familiar and equally important is the su
 bsequent history of the document. How did the Declaration go from being a c
 ongressional PR document of moderate significance to becoming the defining 
 document of American history and one of the most influential documents in t
 he history of the world. Though it served an important purpose in 1776\, th
 e Declaration was not particularly noted or celebrated in the decades after
  the Revolution. \n\nIn this talk\, historian Michael D. Hattem will discus
 s how groups from across the political spectrum have redefined the Declarat
 ion and its ideals in an effort to make them more relevant and meaningful t
 o their own times. In the process\, he will show how the Declaration became
  “American Scripture\,” as well as a model for independence-seeking people 
 around the world. \n\nThe lecture will begin at 6PM. Following the lecture\
 , a reception will be held at 7PM with an optional book signing by our spea
 ker. Books will be available for purchase at the Tryon Palace Museum Store.
 \n\nThis is a ticketed event. Tickets are $15.00 (plus taxes and fees) for 
 individuals and $12.00 (plus taxes and fees) for Tryon Palace Foundation me
 mbers.\n\nAbout Our Speaker\nMichael D. Hattem is a historian of the Americ
 an Revolution. He received his PhD in History at Yale University and has ta
 ught at The New School and Knox College. He is the author of The Memory of 
 ’76: The Revolution in American History (Yale University Press\, 2024)\, wh
 ich was a finalist for the 2025 George Washington Prize\, and Past and Prol
 ogue: Politics and Memory in the American Revolution (Yale University Press
 \, 2020). Hattem’s work has been featured or mentioned in The New York Time

DESCRIPTION:Textiles function as utilitarian\, decorative\, and documentary
  objects\, often sharing the maker’s values\, aspirations\, and personal hi
 story. As we commemorate America’s semiquincentennial\, this seminar will e
 xplore the ways that women in the colonial and early American periods creat
 ed textiles—particularly quilts\, needlework\, and woven baskets—to reflect
  and create a burgeoning American identity. \n\nPlease plan to join us in W
 inston-Salem or online for this two day seminar. Participants will engage i
 n two days of lectures\, including a keynote address by Alden O’Brien\, as 
 well as opportunities to participate in pre-conference workshops and an ope

 y! The America 250 NC Washington County 250th Committee and the Washington 
 County Historical Society at the Daniel Davenport Festival have come togeth
 er to commemorate the lives of Revolutionary War Soldiers.\n\nThere will be
  living history demonstrations\, including ropemaking\, examples of soldier

 s will provide musical performances. Other presentations include medicine d
 uring the American Revolution\, and the Tyrrell County Men who served in th

 hed until 1799.\n\nTours of the main house and its assorted buildings\, whi
 ch illustrate 18th-century life\, including a corn crib\, smokehouse\, and 
 a building for the loom\, have been arranged. The Homestead is on the Natio
 nal Register of Historic Places. It is a rare but fine example of a late 18
 th-century yeoman farmer's dwelling\, and it remains in nearly original con
 dition\, despite the fact that the descendants of Davenport lived in the ho
 use until the mid-1970s without making any modern improvements. A truly uni
 que gem in the region.\n\nThe Sons of the American Revolution are holding a
  recognition and wreath-laying ceremony\, including information about Danie
 l Davenport's six-month service in the NC 5th Regiment and his legacy in Wa
 shington County\, at 2:00 pm. Local school children will sing as part of th
 e ceremony.\n\nPlease note: The celebration festival is free\, but the food

DESCRIPTION:Join us at The Park at Seven Devils for some backyard birding! 
 Birding is an activity that can be done by anyone at any age. Most birders 
 start out by identifying common birds found at their backyard bird feeders.
  During this workshop you will learn how to point out key characteristics\,
  such as size\, coloration\, and activity\, that can help you identify comm
 on backyard bird species\, specifically species that visit bird feeders. By
  using applications like Audubon and Merlin\, along with identification gui
 des\, you will be able to use those key characteristics to help you identif
 y common species found here in the High Country. Binoculars are not require
 d\, but highly recommended\, and there will be a quick lesson on how to pro
 perly use binoculars. This is a Ranger Workshop with The Town of Seven Devi
 ls.

DESCRIPTION:*Save the Date* More Details Coming Soon! The New Bern Resolves
  constitute a significant chapter in the history of the American Revolution
 \, reflecting the growing discontent of the colonies with British rule and 
 their bold steps toward self-governance. Adopted on August 27\, 1774\, by 7
 1 elected NC delegates to the First Provincial Congress in America\, the Ne
 w Bern Resolves represented an early\, decisive expression of resistance to
  British policies and "The Intolerable Acts" (Boston Port/Trade Act\, Massa
 chusetts Government Act\, Administration of Justice Act\, and Quartering Ac
 ts) by calling for economic sanctions against Great Britain and its trading
  partners. As one of the earliest documented calls for solidarity among the
  colonies\, the New Bern Resolves laid the groundwork for broader revolutio
 nary movements.

DESCRIPTION:Harriet Ann Daves recalled just how monumental Civil War surren
 ders were for her family: "When the surrender came my grandfather came to m
 y mother and told her: 'Well\, you are as free as I am.'"\n\nClaiming freed
 om was not so straightforward for the 331\,059 enslaved women\, children\, 
 and men during the Civil War. Some took enormous risk to reach Union lines 
 before the federal government made any promise of abolishing slavery. Other
 s left their homes and plantations to follow Sherman's army as they marched
  through the southeast. Some believed home was where they already lived and
  worked and waited patiently for freedom to extend to them. Others still we
 re lied to by their enslavers or moved away from the advancing U.S. Army so
  they would remain enslaved. Freedom came in different ways and at differen
 t times to enslaved people across the state.\n\nOne common thread unites th
 ese freedom stories: the defeat of the Confederate military ensured a new b
 irth of freedom across the state and nation.\n\nDuring this special luminar
 y program\, Bennett Place invites you to reflect on the end of the Civil Wa
 r as a momentous step towards freedom for all Americans and the end of chat
 tel slavery in the United States. Walk among 3\,310 luminaries - one for ev
 ery 1\,000 enslaved people in North Carolina - and reflect on experiences o
 f enslavement and freedom. Historians dot the path and share stories of peo
 ple's pathways to freedom and life after slavery & the Civil War.
