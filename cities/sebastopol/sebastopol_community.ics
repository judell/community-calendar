SUMMARY:ZEN & Heart Practices
DESCRIPTION:The Occidental Laguna Sangha is a Zen Buddhist Sangha located in Sebastopol\, California. Though our emphasis is primarily Zen we integrate mindfulness and other teachings from the Vipassana and Tibetan traditions into our practice. We believe that everything that comes our way is an opportunity for opening — our work in the world\, our everyday tasks\, our relationships — everything is an opportunity to practice the Bodhisattva ideals of mindfulness\, compassion\, generosity and kindness. \nWe meet every Sunday at the Youth Annex\, Sebastopol Cultural Center from 9-10:30. By Donation ($15 suggested). The Guiding Teacher is Bruce Fortin with 50 years of meditation experience. \nOur name incorporates “Occidental\,” as this is the town where we first started meeting together. The word also carries the meaning “Western\,” where the Buddha Dharma is now being established. “Laguna” is where we currently meet and meditate together\, right next to the beautiful Laguna de Santa Rosa in Sebastopol California. \nThe Sangha is respectful of all the teachings and schools of Buddhism and includes practitioners of all levels\, from complete beginners to the very experienced. All are welcome to practice with us. \nThe guiding teacher for the Sangha is Bruce Fortin. He was ordained a Soto Zen Priest in the lineage of Suzuki Roshi in 1976 and has received Dharma Transmission to teach in that lineage. He has also studied with a number of other teachers in the Tibetan and Vipassana traditions and his teachings reflect their influence.

SUMMARY:Divine Voice
DESCRIPTION:Divine Voice\nwith Kiranjot Kaur of Copper Wimmin\nIndian Classical Note Singing as a Meditation\non Sound and Presence\nWednesday at 7:30 – 9 pm (time may run over by 15 min)\nI believe that EVERYONE can sing and that we are each designed as divine instruments! \nIn the tradition of Indian Classical music we surrender to the practice\, to music herself. It is a practice\nof letting go of who we think we are and any limitations we believe we have. \nIt is an exercise of becoming present and allowing music to move through like breath through a\nbeautiful flute. We can gently allow each note to brush the strings of our hearts instrument and\nbecome the voice of our soul. \nThis vocal practice works on breath support\, intonation\, vocal range\, dexterity and tone\, note\nrecognition\, projection and presence. \nThis class is open to ALL no experience needed! We spend the first 45 minutes in a blissful call and\nresponse note singing practice and end with chanting and or a composition in a particular Raag (set of\nnotes). \nMy teacher\, Dr.Ustad Narinder Singh Sandhu\, taught me that: \n“You do not need to know anything about music to sing.\nYou do not need to have a beautiful voice or talent to sing.\nThe only thing that you need is love.” \nKiranjot Kaur is a vocalist\, founding member of Copper Wimmin\, Kundalini Yoga teacher\, and Indian classical music instructor\, with a deep devotion to the Divine Mother and A Course in Miracles. Copper Wimmin gained recognition through appearances on Democracy Now and the Showtime series The L Word\, where their song “Bleeding Rivers” was featured. \nIn 2006\, Kiranjot refocused her career toward Indian classical music\, dedicating five years to living and studying under the tutelage of her beloved teacher\, Dr. Ustad Narindar Singh\, in Amritsar\, India. Shifting away from traditional performances where the audience is separate from the performer\, Kiranjot now merges her early experiences of communal singing with Sweet Honey in the Rock and Bobby McFerrin\, alongside her deep love for Indian music and Kirtan traditions. \nIn 2014\, Kiranjot was introduced to A Course in Miracles\, and has since steadily integrated its daily lessons into her life. She now offers a unique blend of Indian classical notes and A Course in Miracles songs\, sung in the Kirtan style of call and response. Kiranjot invites everyone to experience the transformative healing power of their own voice in the practice of singing together as ONE. \nFrom her journeys through India to Chile and back\, Kiranjot has discovered her greatest joy is inspiring everyone regardless of their singing experience\, to use their voices as a method for quieting the mind\, surrendering to presence\, and revolutionary self-love. \nFor more information please email: kiranjot@mantramamas.org \nFirst class: by donation\nDrop in class: $25 \n5 class stamp card: $100 (must be used within 8 weeks)\nClass pass card available in person at first class or online HERE
