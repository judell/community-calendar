 orkshop that introduces the art and technique of copper plate drypoint and
  water-based monotype printmaking. Designed in conjunction with the exhibi
 tion of Wayne Thiebaud’s prints\, this program invites participants to e
 xplore the artist’s approach to printmaking while creating their own ori
 ginal works.Day one\, participants will learn the fundamentals of drypoint
  on copper\, from incising lines and textures with a variety of tools to i
 nking\, wiping\, and printing with an etching press. The session will incl
 ude demonstrations\, discussion of Thiebaud’s use of printmaking techniq
 ues\, and time for individual experimentation.The second day focuses on wa
 ter-based monotype\, a painterly process in which images are drawn or pain
 ted onto plexiglass and transferred to paper using the press. Participants
  will have the opportunity to combine drypoint and monotype methods\, expe
 riment with layering\, and explore the expressive range of both processes.
 This class will be taught by master printer Courtney Sennish who worked cl
 osely with Thiebaud on multiple works during her time at Crown Point Press
