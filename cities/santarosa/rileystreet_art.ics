SUMMARY: East Asian Calligraphy Demonstration
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Christine Renden Haggarty\nSaturday\, January 24t
 h\n10:00AM - 12:00PM\nFree!\nLocation: Santa Rosa Store\n\nThe invention 
 of the brush in 300 B.C. revolutionized civilization at the time. Up unti
 l then\, people were carving in stone or bone or writing with sticks in t

  mother of invention\, the brush was created.\n\nWe invite you to join Ch
 ristine for this illuminating demonstration that will introduce you to th
 e history and art of East Asian Calligraphy. You will experience three di
 fferent types of script – formal\, semi-cursive and cursive and the signi
 ficance of the brush stroke.\n\nChristine has studied with several differ
 ent calligraphy masters over 20 years. She has participated in exhibition
 s around the world\; most recently in San Francisco and Healdsburg. She i
 s the Associate Editor of Heart of the Brush\, a collaborative work with 
 Kazuaki Tanahashi\, published in 2016. For more information about Christi
 ne or to see more of her work\, please visit her website at zenbrush.net

SUMMARY: Fresh Pressed Flower Card Demonstration
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Jan Lochner\nSaturday\, January 24th\n2:00PM-4:00
 PM\nSanta Rosa Location\nFree\n\nThis inspiring demonstration will introd
 uce you to the beautiful world of fresh pressed flowers and the wonderful
  things you can create with them! Cards\, bookmarks\, gift tags and so ma
 ny other things! Local artist and teacher\, Jan Lochner will explain how 
 to press flowers and which flowers hold their color best. It is a creativ
 e experience!\n\nCreating note cards from pressed flowers has been Jan’s 
 hobby for 25 years\, though she has no formal art training. She utilizes 
 color\, shape and texture on fine quality paper\, each card uniquely hand
 made. Jan’s home in Sebastopol is her studio: the dining room table is he
 r workshop\, the kitchen cupboards storing boxes and trays of flowers. Sh
 e buy card stock by the thousand and pick blooms from her garden and othe
 r public places. Her family is used to me saying\, “could we stop for jus
 t a few minutes so I can gather some… ”\n\nIt is a wonderful way of life.
 \n\n*A note to all students: Please park on in the East facing parking lo
 t while attending classes. We greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link
