 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta
 edtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists 
 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books and Read On Sonoma are honored
  to welcome literacy advocate and motivational speaker Oliver James for th
 e launch of his powerful new memoir - Unread: A Memoir of Learning \\(and 
 Loving\\) to Read on TikTok! Oliver will be joined in conversation by belo
 ved friend and local librarian\, Mychal Threets. Join us for an unforgetta
 ble evening of literary insight followed by an audience Q&A and book signi
 ng with photo opportunities. All event proceeds will be donated to local n
 on-profit and vital literacy initiative\,  Read On Sonoma . This is a free
  event\, registration required due to limited seating. Honest and thought-
 provoking\, Unread is an inspiring\, hopeful memoir of growth and change -
  Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational n
 eglect\, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approxi
 mately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However\, at age 32\,
  with big dreams and few tools to actualize them\, he dedicated himself to
  learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliv
 er has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documen
 ted his decision to learn to read as an adult\, and his struggles and triu
 mphs along the way. Here\, he tells the full story behind his journey for 
 the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his exper
 ience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us ho
 w to be better\, more empathetic people. In just 365 days\, Oliver went fr
 om barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal o
 f finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us 
 that words and stories have power\, and that\, no matter our past\, it's n
 ever too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal
  trainer\, motivational speaker\, literacy activist\, and influencer. He h
 as been featured in or on Today\, NPR\, Jennifer Hudson Show\, Los Angeles
  Times\, Newsweek\, Rachael Ray\, and ABC News\, among many others. Additi
 onally\, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Lite
 racy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa\, California. Mychal Threets is a libra
 rian\, literary ambassador\, and the library's number one fan \\(according
  to himself\, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-
 school kid and grew up in Fairfield\, CA\, right between Sacramento and Sa
 n Francisco. Online\, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people th
 at their mental health always matters\, and he encourages everyone to know
  they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself\, Mychal is proud to
  serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/
 26\\) is his first book. His cats\, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barl
 ow\, did not help at all\, but he still appreciates them. Read On Sonoma a
  dedicated group of professionals\, educators and volunteers promoting lit
 eracy within our elementary schools. Donate directly\, meet the Executive 
 team\, and learn more about the tremendous work that they do by joining us
  that evening. For more information\, please visit their  website . Praise
 : "Unread feels like both story and concordance\, a good read and a great 
 resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But 
 mostly\, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in o
 rder to enunciate resilience\, one must learn the phonetics of desire\, su
 rvival\, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel." -Jason Reynolds\, New Yor
 k Times bestselling author of the Track series "An inspiring and deeply hu
 man story about resilience\, courage\, and the transformative power of lit
 eracy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey\, shared with millions onl
 ine\, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He
  not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late
  to learn\, to dream\, and to rewrite your own story." -Andrew Roberts\, P
 resident\, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy "Oliver James is a 
 big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave
 \, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . 
 He's the living\, breathing\, thriving example of what reading can do for 
 a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel\, there a
 re quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he 
 went through-but if their parents\, educators\, and leaders would read thi
 s memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them\, to
 o. This raw\, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has be
 en through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth
 ." -I. C. Robledo\, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By "Unread isn'
 t just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of ou
 r own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to 
 the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver J
 ames is a role model for us all." -Kelley Coleman\, author of Everything N
 o One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child "A thoughtful and inspiri
 ng story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading help
 s to change lives." -Kirkus

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 d. These experiences provided the first inspiration for him to start singi
 ng. He then moved to NYC and lived there for 7 years. Dylan’s friend and
  collaborator Ray Angry \\(the Roots\\) helped initiate him into the world
  of hip hop & production & connected him with Om'mas Keith \\(producer of

 s\, touring his music\, self-producing and engineering his Records: first 
 all original solo record “All I Need” \\(released 2022\\)\, and his fi
 nished 2nd self produced album entitled "Love Languages” \\(single "Be Y

 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:Brazilian-born brothers Sérgio and Odair Assad celebrate 60 y
 ears of setting the standard of guitar innovation\, ingenuity and expressi

 mily rich in Brazilian musical tradition and studies under guitarist/luten
 ist Monina Távora\, a disciple of Andrés Segovia. Their virtuosity has i
 nspired a wide range of composers to write for them including Astor Piazzo
 lla\, Terry Riley\, Radamés Gnattali\, Marlos Nobre\, Nikita Koshkin\, Ro
 land Dyens\, Jorge Morel\, Edino Krieger\, and Francisco Mignone. Sérgio 
 has added to their repertoire by composing music for the duo that showcase

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Bluegrass\, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding
  musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm\, Joh
 n Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seam
 lessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time m
 usic for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year\, with seven ac
 claimed albums and two Juno nominations\, the Jaybirds are simultaneously 
 innovative and unadorned\, sophisticated and stripped-down\, happily old-f
 ashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance\, $40 at 
 the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelcha
 ir accessible. Art gallery open during intermission\, refreshments for sal
 e.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman "one of the worl
 d's undisputed masters" of the mandolin\, famed for outstanding tone and t
 aste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular fav
 ourites for sessions and covers\, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He 
 has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded o
 n many other projects\, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The 
 Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music wit
 h highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller\; t
 he duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San 
 Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bl
 uegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary "new acoustic" qu
 artet\, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit\, renowned for highly skilled i
 nstrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed
  the Jaybirds. Of their latest album\, Folk Radio UK said "On That Other G
 reen Shore showcases an accomplished\, experienced band at the peak of the
 ir powers\, with musicianship of the very highest order." Peghead Nation c
 alled it "one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017." 
 Los Angeles\, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 201
 7. The veteran performer has played with\, among others\, Doc Watson\, Ric
 hard Greene\, John Jorgensen\, Peter Rowan\, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty.
  He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions
  by Laurie Lewis\, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher
  Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Day
 lighting the Creek as "a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the g
 lory days of early bluegrass guitar." Chilliwack\, BC-based Trisha Gagnon 
 is portrayed by Sing Out! as "one of the most versatile" and "irresistible
 " lead vocalists in bluegrass\, her strong and distinctive style ranging f
 rom "mournful and plaintive" to "hopeful and yearning." Trisha anchors wha
 t Dirty Linen magazine calls "gorgeous three-part harmonies." She's also k
 nown for songwriting\, dating back to her early days with the award-winnin
 g B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gil
 l and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo\, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his ow
 n voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contempo
 rary banjo players. "Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingli
 ng\," said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\)\, was nom
 inated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015\, and Nick is a composer wh
 o also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley S
 tation on the new Jaybird album "showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense 
 of melody\," said Green Man Review. Spokane\, WA-based Greg Spatz is haile
 d as a "world-class bluegrass fiddler" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Aud
 ition says Greg's "virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after ti
 me\," while Bluegrass Unlimited says he "lays down some seriously fine blu
 egrass fiddle" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made 
 him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast\, where he'
 s played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield\, resophonic guitar maste
 r Rob Ickes\, and many others including Laurie Lewis\, Bryan Bowers\, and 
 Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squ
 irrel\, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with h
 is wife called All Along the Sea\, and is an award-winning

DESCRIPTION:Water Tower is the current moniker of multi-instrumentalist Ke
 nny Feinstein’s musical brainchild\, originally founded in 2005 in Portl
 and. While their lineup has evolved over time\, fuelled by Feinstein’s m
 asterful song-crafting\, fiercely DIY approach\, and genre-bending sonic i
 dentity\, Water Tower have established themselves as a global force to be 
 reckoned with.\n\nPioneers of a new wave of bluegrass and old-time with a 
 distinctly punk rock flair\, Water Tower take influences from Foghorn Stri
 ngband and Bill Monroe to Rancid and Black Flag\, passing them through a u
 nique lens that magnifies the individual strength of their core and auxili
 ary members while remaining faithful to the revivalist spirit.\n\nIn 2015\
 , the band moved to LA\, where their current lineup of Kenny Feinstein \\(
 lead vocals\, guitar\, fiddle\, mandolin\\)\, Tommy Drinkard \\(banjo\, vo
 cals\\)\, Taylor Estes \\(Bass\, Vocals\, and Nicholas Leahy \\(mandolin\,
  vocals\\) can often be found busking while not in the studio or on tour.\
 n\nSince then\, Water Tower have built major momentum\, releasing a concep
 t album Fly Around \\(ft. guest vocals from Black Flag’s Ron Reyes and p
 roduced by Don Bolles of The Germs\\)\, filming 1m\\+ view viral videos\, 
 and catching the eye of A-listers including Katy Perry\, whose 2023 NYE pa
 rty they played at\, and Riff Raff\, who shouted out “Take Me Back”\, 
 the debut single from their upcoming album Live from Los Angeles\, to be r
 eleased later this year. A slew of tour dates in the US and the UK has alr
 eady been announced.

DESCRIPTION:Understanding the Nervous Systems of Horses and Humans with He
 art and Mind Equine's HSH (highly sensitive horses). Everyone welcome.\n\n
 **Speaking Horse Class** is offered by Heart & Mind Equine Horse Rescue. T
 his began as our volunteer class and has expanded to serve the larger comm
 unity. A chance to meet our rescued therapy horses\, check out our volunte
 er program\, and learn some holistic horse keeping and equine assisted ser
 vices (e.g. therapy\, coaching\, leadership\, and teambuilding with horses
 ). NO experience necessary\, and both horse and mental health professional
 s are welcome--truly all are welcome (9+ years old.)\n\nCurious about Equi
 ne Assisted Psychotherapy? Speaking Horse is not therapy\, but it is an op
 portunity to get a "taste" of EAP because we use some of the same tools an
 d exercises in both settings. So come out out and meet the herd (both huma
 ns and horses) connected with Friendly Trails and Heart & Mind Equine.\n\n
 Each month the class is centered on a holistic horse keeping theme\, equin
 e assisted learning\, understanding herd dynamics\, holistic horse care an
 d training\, or how they all relate to our human journey. FEBRUARY THEME: 
 Year of the Fire Horse As the Lunar New Year is in February\, we will borr
 ow the theme of the passing Year of the Snake\, shedding what is old and n
 o longer needed and embracing the power and majesty of the horse. This tim
 e of year also coincides with the horses literally shedding (plan to be co
 vered in horse hair as we groom them.) We will explore how the herd's ecos
 ystem changes as they experience spring and the lessons we can learn from 
 them.\n\nHorse lovers\, highly sensitive people\, mental health providers\
 , parents\, and teachers might especially benefit from this class as well 
 as horse owners/riders who hope to improve their relationships with their 
 equine partners. (Though this work is great for dogs as well\, your dogs a
 re not welcome at our horse rescue due to liability and distraction concer
 ns.) Newcomers and novices are most welcome.\n\nCome and experience the ma
 gic of working with horses firsthand. Get ready to roll up your sleeves\, 
 get your hands dirty\, and connect with these majestic creatures. Whether 
 you're a seasoned equestrian or just starting out\, there's something for 
 everyone at our Speaking Horse classes. Don't miss out on this exciting ch
 ance to bond with horses and fellow horse lovers. We can't wait to see you
  there!

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Jenny Kerr is one of few active contemporary artists who fully
  embody the breadth of the Americana idiom\, mining the roots of folk\, bl
 ues\, country\, bluegrass and rock to produce a catalog of original work t
 hat is respectfully steeped in tradition while still fresh\, modern and im
 mediately identifiable as her own.\n\n \n\nAn accomplished multi-instrumen
 talist\, Kerr deftly traverses guitar\, dobro\, banjo\, piano and harmonic
 a over the course of a show\, but it’s her deeply soulful\, powerhouse v
 ocals that define her sound and connect with audiences worldwide.\n\n \n\n
 Kerr’s musical education began in San Francisco\, where she was exposed 
 to the European classical tradition by her grandmother\, a composer and th
 e principal violist for the Cleveland Symphony. In her formative teenage y
 ears\, Jimi Hendrix\, Janis Joplin and Muddy Waters lured her away from th
 e concert hall as she explored the vibrant Bay Area folk\, blues and psych
 edelic rock scene of the late ‘60s and early ‘70s.\n\n \n\nThe music o
 f The Haight led her on a journey of discovery of the foundations of Ameri
 cana ­­– artists such as Mississippi Fred McDowell\, Little Walter and
  Dock Boggs who initially inspired her to pick up guitar\, harmonica and b
 anjo.\n\n \n\nKerr and musical partner/producer/guitarist Phil “Philbill
 ie” Milner are the core of a rotating collective of the Bay Area’s top
  session players\, so every live show is fresh and unique\, centered aroun
 d Kerr’s songwriting and vocal delivery and accentuated by some of the f
 inest soloists and support musicians in the business. Milner\, a highly so
 ught-after producer and session guitarist\, had an extended tenure as guit
 ar tech for Bob Weir & Ratdog as well as Tracy Chapman\, Bonnie Raitt and 
 Primus.\n\n \n\nKerr’s previous releases include the critically-acclaime
 d “Head of Fire\,” produced and performed collaboratively with Bill Bo
 ttrell \\(Sheryl Crow\, Michael Jackson\, George Harrison\, Madonna\, Tom 
 Petty\\)\, and a highly-anticipated\, self-produced album is soon to be re
 leased on the pair’s independent label\, Okey Doke Records.\n\n \n\nKerr
  is as much at home in the local music scene of Marin County which she now
  calls home as she is on major festival stages nationally and worldwide\, 
 bringing the same power\, energy\, heart and rootsy soul to every performa
 nce. \n\n—Joshua Zucker\, SF Chronicle

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next 
 round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers\, 2013's Electric Punishment\,
  and 2016's Concussion Protocol.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 NNY AND CLYDE ON THE LAM Learn the basics of fungal biology\, foraging\, a

 ed scientist\, mushroom enthusiast\, and social media star behind Fascinat
 ed By Fungi. In Dr. Fun Guy’s Passport to Kingdom Fungi\, Dr. Gordon Wal
 ker brings his scientific knowledge and love for everything fungi to the p
 age. The first section of this book is written in a comprehensive question
 -and-answer format. Starting with “What are fungi?\,” you’ll learn a
 bout everything from what mycelium is and fungi’s evolution and biochemi
 stry to how they are classified and how they impact our world today. You w
 ill also find information on best foraging practices and culinary techniqu
 es. The second half of this book introduces you to mushroom identification
  skills and profiles various mushrooms and other fungi\, from incredible e
 dibles you can find in the wild to the dangerously toxic\, medicinal\, and
  just plain weird. Finally\, you’ll find fungal phenomena\, showing the 
 amazing breadth and diversity of the fungal kingdom. With colorful and com
 prehensive science illustrations\, mushroom photography\, and QR codes lin
 king to resources to help you continue your fungal explorations\, this is 
 the perfect portal to step through into the world of mushrooms. “Gordon 
 Walker’s book is fun\, yes\, and richly illustrated\, but at the same ti
 me it’s an impressively detailed survey of the fungal kingdom and its fa
 scinating denizens\, mushrooms and molds\, yeasts\, and more.”—Harold 
 McGee\, author of On Food and Cooking and Nose Dive “Gordon Walker’s e
 nthusiasm on the pages \\(and in person\\) is contagious\, and he’s a gr

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists 
 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 \n\nIn this delightful\, laugh-a-minute comedy\, four unique Southern wome
 n\, all needing to escape the sameness of their day-to-day routines\, are

 Together\, they discover lasting friendships and a renewed determination t
 o live in the moment—and most importantly\, realize it’s never too lat
 e to make new old friends.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

  attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from 
 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki

 the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the sta

  melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influenc

 s in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:S.R. Laws: An inspiring Storyteller in Song\n\n        S.R. La
 ws is a performing and recording original musical artist whose work resona
 tes with a familiar warmth while introducing entirely fresh ideas. Hailed 
 by guitarist/promoter Scotty O’Neill as “an ORIGINAL songwriter who kn
 ows how to tell a story clearly in song\,” Laws has built a reputation f
 or songs that capture both nostalgia and innovation.\n\nEarly Influences a
 nd Musical Roots  \n\nGrowing up in Northern California\, Laws developed a
  deep bond with music at an early age. His father worked as a trash collec
 tor\, and young Scott Ray Laws \\(a.k.a. S.R. Laws\\) spent countless hour
 s digging through discarded 45-rpm records. Each discovery—whether caked
  in grime or found pristine—felt like unearthing treasure. The thrill of
  dropping the needle on something new ignited his lifelong passion for son
 g-craft.\n\nThe Texas Pilgrimage  \n\nWith only two suitcases and $500 to 
 his name\, Laws set out for Austin\, Texas—the “Live Music Capital of 
 the World.” There\, open‐mic nights and songwriter showcases became hi
 s classroom. Night after night\, he honed his craft\, forging connections 
 and absorbing the essence of Americana\, roots rock\, and modern folk.\n\n
  “It was such a treat catching your set last night—really refreshing t
 o hear something new and original. Thanks for pulling up a chair and hangi
 ng out with us—we really enjoyed the conversation and the stories behind
  your songs.” - Tripp B.\, Singer-Songwriter\n\nInfluences That Shaped H
 is Voice  \n\nLaws draws inspiration from master storytellers who paved th
 e way for heartfelt\, lyrical music. Artists who have left an indelible ma
 rk on his craft include:\n\n- John Hiatt  \n\n- Lucinda Williams  \n\n- Ro
 dney Crowell  \n\n- Neil Finn  \n\n- Patty Griffin  \n\n- Steve Earle  \n\
 n- Ron Sexsmith  \n\nTheir mastery of narrative and melody has shaped his 
 own artistic journey\, resulting in songs that feel both comfortingly fami
 liar and entirely “out there.”\n\nCritical Acclaim  \n\nColleagues and
  venue owners alike have praised his work and stage presence:  \n\n“Scot
 t Ray Laws is a unique and really cool songwriter…he digs into materials
 \, tells a story in his songs\, and has a clean baritone vocality that is 
 easy on the ears. We had a chance to meet and hang with Scott back in May
 …and I had to have him back for a Wednesday evening.” - Luigi\, Owner 
 of The Listening Room\n\n“Expect slow-burning passion and vivid music…
 the kind of energy that turns into ‘let’s stay for just one more!” -
  Doug\, Owner/Wine Maker at Spicy Vines\n\nCurrent Projects  \n\nNow based
  in Sonoma County\, California\, Laws works tirelessly as a recording\, wr
 iting & touring artist. Through over 100 gig dates a year\, intimate club 
 shows\, festival stages\, house concerts and late-night songwriter circles
 \, he invites audiences to join him on a musical journey—one heartfelt s
 tory at a time.\n\nWith a blend of classic influence\, modern vision\, and
  a voice that feels like home\, S.R. Laws continues to carve out his place
  in the American songwriting landscape.

 ental\, emotional and spiritual bodies. She will talk about the importance
  of self care\, focusing on the most impacted organs\, how to recognize wh
 at is needed\, and ways in which to support yourself\, physically\, emotio
 nally\, spiritually\, and mentally. She will focus on herbal medicine and 
 other somatic and ancient methods to support the immune system. There will
  be time for an open dialogue with the audience and to answer questions. W
 hat makes this evening especially powerful is that it takes place within t
 he amplified bioenergetic field of the EESystem. As Dr. Maria speaks about
  cellular resonance\, coherence\, and restoring balance\, guests will simu
 ltaneously be immersed in a scalar-energy environment designed to support 
 optimal cellular communication and energetic harmony. The experience becom
 es more than a lecture — it becomes embodied learning.\n\nThis event off
 ers a welcoming introduction to Dr. Maria’s work. For those who feel ca
 lled to go deeper\, Dr Maria will hold on March 15th a group healing circl
 e ceremony/workshop. It is a guided interactive process\, in which each pa
 rticipant will experience a variety of techniques using light\, sound\, to
 uch\, energy and ancient wisdom healing techniques. Whether you are new to
  her work or already familiar with energy-based healing\, this evening is 
 an invitation to explore what becomes possible when wisdom\, frequency\, a
 nd intention align. We look forward to welcoming you into the field.\n\nAb
 out Dr Maria Michael\n\nDr. Maria D. Michael is a world renowned and respe
 cted medical intuitive\, channel\, empath\, healer\, psychic and teacher f
 or over 40 years. She has been awarded 5 advanced degrees \\(all Summa Cum
  Laude\\)\, including a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. She has doctorate-
 level training in Neuropsychology and Special Education and extensive post
 -doctoral studies in Psychoanalysis and Jungian Psychology. Additionally\,
  Dr. Michael is trained and experienced in EMDR\, Hypnotherapy\, LENS Neur
 ofeedback\, Neurolinguistic Programming\, Eriksonian Hypnosis Training. Sh
 e is a Lakota/Diné \\(Navajo\\) Traditional elder\, has participated in a
 nd led traditional Native ceremonies and doctored alongside Lakota Medicin
 e people. She has been sought out worldwide for her powerful Medicine Ener
 gies and Healing abilities.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nDr. Maria Michael believes that 
 we all come from the same Creation\, and that everyone has the potential a
 nd capacity to communicate with Creation. While the Lakota call Creation 
 “The Great Mystery\,” other traditions may refer to Creation\, with na
 mes such as\, “God\,” “the Universe\,” “Allah\,” “Yahweh\,
 ” “Divine Love\,” “Universal Love” or “Cosmic Consciousness.
 ”\n\nWe not only choose our human families\, but also we choose\, initia
 lly at least\, our own unique form or tradition of understanding and commu
 nication with the Great Mystery. No form or tradition is better than anoth
 er. Humans are merely attempting to understand “That” which is beyond 
 comprehension.\n\nAll messages from the Great Mystery are compassionate an
 d loving\, even though at times these messages may appear difficult. Creat
 ion’s message appears to us in whatever way we choose to comprehend it. 
 Sometimes\, we are only capable of comprehending deeply sensitive messages
  that resound in our hearts\, and sometimes only strong and “seemingly
 ” shocking messages penetrate our defenses. This loving Spirit guides us
  to remove those obstacles that stand in our way of becoming all that Crea
 tion and We intended us to be.

 the band’s third studio outing under the tutelage of Grammy-winning prod
 ucer **Dave Way**\, who fosters a level of depth and organic cohesion that
  firmly establishes Wreckless Strangers in San Francisco’s storied rock 
 ‘n’ roll legacy.  The first single\, "Dirty Soul\," came out on Janua

DESCRIPTION:FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWh
 y Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute 
 interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stresse
 d out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyo
 nd Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Mad
 e plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something s
 till isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the r
 ight things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\, or creative en
 deavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrated underneath it
  all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But becau
 se there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T
  TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when conf
 idence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up re
 sponsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progres
 s without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) throu
 gh uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of re
 al-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle culture.\n\nEverythi
 ng you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\, adjusted\, and prac
 ticed in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and real life.\n\nWHAT THI
 S WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a pra
 ctical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in plannin
 g and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t com
 e first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How s
 mall\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited t
 o slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what actually matters right 
 now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• 
 Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about w
 hat you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop w
 aiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willing
 ness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\
 n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually
  holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed se
 nse of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next step forward\n\n• A pra
 ctical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretendin
 g.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell i
 s an Inspirational Author\, Teacher\, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Co
 ach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experi
 ence.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery\, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(
 and its companion workbook\\)\, Morning Motivation\, and Chill.\n\nHis wor
 k is grounded\, practical\, and focused on real change — without hype\, 
 dogma\, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TA
 KE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready\, this workshop 
 opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help 
 you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals a
 nd changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. 
 Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DTEND;TZID=PST;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260307T200000
UID:251123sAQDQM4YJESVzFk8O6iqcg
DESCRIPTION:Jordana is a pioneering US Drum & Bass DJ\, musician & produce
 r based in Seattle. Recently she  launched her SpeKtra residency at Kremwe
 rk\, became an Imagine Audio artist and joined the Emergence DnB Collectiv
 e. A global performer and trans rights advocate.\n\nIn the 90s\, Jordana e
 stablished herself as one of the early pioneers of U.S. Drum and Bass\, re
 leasing a few albums for the New York-based Jungle Sky label as well as a 
 plethora of singles and remixes. \n\nHer introduction to electronic dance 
 music came in 1988 when she began listening to BBC broadcasts featuring re
 ports on the rise of acid house music. It wasn't until the early '90s that
  dance music crept into Pittsburgh\, and Jordana began frequenting many of
  the city's first rave-like parties and soon began making dance music of h
 er own. \n\nHer first signed work was an atmospheric Drum 'n' Bass remix o
 f Blondie's "Atomic" in 1995 for EMI/Chrysalis. Liquid Sky Music then star
 ted releasing her music in 1996\, beginning with the compilation track "Di
 s Soun'" featured on This Is Jungle Sky\, Vol. 2. The New York label also 
 released a few murderous albums in the subsequent years\, beginning with W
 hen Worlds Collide \\(1997\\) and continuing through Quality Rolls \\(1998
 \\) and The Cities Collection \\(2000\\). The Cities Collection was releas
 ed under the Jordana name\, though her record label ignored her wishes for
  the change and mainly pushed “1.8.7.” She now considers 1.8.7 a deadn
 ame.\n\nAs both a producer and DJ\, Jordana has toured the world as a head
 liner. She has also worked with artists such as Mike Joyce \\(formerly of 
 The Smiths\\)\, Debbie Harry and Blondie\, Lady Sovereign\, MC Kinky from 
 London/ffrr\, Yellownote and TC Izlam from Liquid Sky Records. In England 
 she played Garage as Lady J on Flex FM. \n\nJordana has been featured or a
 ppeared in Resident Advisor\, Spin\, Rolling Stone\, Knowledge \\(UK\\)\, 
 Vibe\, Raygun\, Urb\, Mixmag and Out Magazine and has been listed in Raygu
 n's "Who's Who of International DJs". She also made Out Magazine's OUT100 
 in 1999. 2014 saw her named in Harriet magazine as "12 women in black musi
 c history you should know".  In 2015 Mixmag named her as "20 women who sha
 ped the history of dance music".\n\nIn 2014\, Jordana scored the documenta
 ry Free CeCe produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress/directo
 r Laverne Cox. Jordana has dedicated her career to speaking publicly about
  trans issues and Black Lives and has been featured in several cultural bo
 oks including New York Times bestseller ‘The Rise of the Creative Class
 ’ by Richard Florida\, Michaelangelo Matos’s ‘The Underground is Mas
 sive’ and ‘Rave Culture\, an Insider’s Overview’ by Jimi Fritz and
  Virginia Smallfry. This work is close to home for Jordana as she’s a ha
 te crime survivor herself.\n\nInspired by the Black Lives Matter movement 
 in 2020\, Jordana returned with the politically-charged single ‘Fight Fo
 r Our Lives’ \\(work-in-progress\\) and a handful of newer productions\,
  teasing a full-album release. She also released ‘The Uprising’ DJ mix
  to Mixcloud and DJ’ed part of Kremwerk’s online Pride celebrations as
  well as on Seattle\, London and LA radio. In addition she performed at Se
 attle’s “Drum and Bass Tuesdays” Livestream as her debut appearance 
 which is the longest running D&B weekly event in the world. \n\n2021 saw h
 er be invited by the prolific festival and brand Dekmantel to contribute t
 o their podcast series and headlined on a lineup with Arca for Currents.fm
  as a part of Un/Tuck and Hot Mass. Additionally she appeared on EQ50 Blac
 k Herstory stream which\, supported by DJ Flight from the UK and DaFunkNYC
  made the debut appearance for the lineup online. Jordana was a writer and
  producer on the song “The Future” on Alpha Pup Records/Producer Dojo 
 with Mimi Page and iLL.Gates August of 2021. An animated music video was a
 lso published to Youtube. 2022 saw Jordana return to performing with an ar
 senal of new tracks as she makes her official in person return at Kremfest
  2022. Throughout 2023 Jordana played several events and underground raves
 .\n\nIn 2024 Jordana launched SpeKtra\, her residency at Kremwerk\, the op
 ening night featured Flava D and the night brought in DJs such as Mizeyesi
 s and a special Pride Month edition brought over B-Complex. Jordana and B-
 Complex also collaborated on a track featuring Zak Meow called Lorem Ipsum
 . She also joined the Emergence DnB Collective.

  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

  present\, embodied\, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditat
 ion\, and periods of silence\, we will explore the body as part of the liv
 ing earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than 
 striving for calm\, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds 
 us—moment by moment\, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to 
 slow down\, listen deeply\, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace withi
 n our own hearts.

SUMMARY:Monoprints: Drawing & Printing Abstraction Two-day workshop

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:In this 4 week course\, participants will learn a unique appro
 ach to watercolor\, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experi
 ence when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will f
 ocus on strengthening one’s observational skills\, giving the artist a f
 oundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering
  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 s the band preparing to release their 13th studio record-Due out in Septem
 ber\, while also celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of Love &

 inal Ginger Brew\, and numerous shows\, including a much anticipated retur
 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton
  Kutcher\, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent i
 nstallation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part

 macus\, Syria. My father is on a diplomatic assignment with the United Nat
 ions to ease tensions on the volatile border between Jordan and Israel. We
  are transferred from Damacus\, Syria\, to Jerusalem\, Jordan in late 1955
 . I came to know and love my Bedouin neighbors. They kindly lend me their 
 only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in th
 e Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beauti
 ful\, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and 
 generous neighbors. Ten years ago\, I picked up volume number one of "The 
 Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night" translated by Sir Richard Franc
 is Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her
  emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of eve
 ry young\, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volume
 s of "Shah Razad" i felt compelled to continue this extraordinary traditio
 n of storytelling\, intended to transmit moral values\, by adding my own s
 tory: Shah Razad...and the Djinns Who Loved Her.

 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University

 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists 
 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta
 edtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip

 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 ooklist Editors’ Choice 2015 - Youth! Named a "Best Book of 2015" by Tim
 e Magazine\, School Library Journal\, Barnes & Noble\, NPR\, PopSugar\, Th
 e Millions\, and The News & Observer! Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One w
 ho's ever been chosen. That's what his roommate\, Baz\, says. And Baz migh
 t be evil and a vampire and a complete git\, but he's probably right. Half
  the time\, Simon can't even make his wand work\, and the other half\, he 
 starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him\, his girlfriend broke
  up with him\, and there's a magic-eating monster running around\, wearing
  Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this\, if he were 
 here--it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks\, and Simon's 
 infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost sto
 ry\, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking a
 s you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far\, far more monsters. 
 "Rowell imbues her magic with awe and spectacle. It's a powerful\, politic
 ally minded allegory about sexual\, ethnic and class identity - with a hea
 dy shot of teenage lust." —New York Times Book Review "It’s a brillian
 tly addictive\, genuinely romantic story about teenagers who can’t be ne
 atly sorted into houses\, coping with stress and loss and the confusion of
  just trying to be who they are. It’s as if Rowell turned the Harry Pott
 er books inside out\, and is showing us the marvelous\, subversive stuffin
 g inside." —Time Magazine "Full of heart and humor\, this fantastical ta
 le is a worthy addition to the wizarding-school genre." —People Magazine
  ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rainbow Rowell is the award-winning \\#1 New York Times 
 bestselling author of Eleanor & Park and the Simon Snow Trilogy\, plus sev
 eral other novels\, short stories\, and comics. She lives in Omaha\, Nebra
 ska\, just like most of her characters.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura

 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

DESCRIPTION:Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of leg
 acy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group\, meeting
  to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous\, or not-so-famous\\) poets o
 f the past & present who have left a mark on literature\, the art of poetr

 rotic\, political\, pastoral & personal\, dreamers\, ragers\, firebrands\,
  sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize\, 
 and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interest
 ed poets & potential participants\, the library will publish this growing 
 list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review\, with
  a short bio & picture\, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poet
 s listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from part
 icipants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wed
 nesday of each month\, we will gather for a round-table review of several 
 poets\, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to expl
 ore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meet
 ing to read about their chosen poet\, explore one or more biographies & se
 veral poems\, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gather
 ing. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems
 \, then we will open a discussion among the participants\, after which tha
 t participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant w
 ill then read a chosen poem\, followed by a discussion\, as well as his or
  her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants
  have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present\, eac
 h segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 On the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States\, Americana 
 Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore\, r
 einterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of &ldquo\;Americana&rdquo\
 ;. This juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar s
 ymbols\, stories\, and styles evolve over time&mdash\;bridging the past an
 d present through creativity and craft. \n\n&ldquo\;Americana&rdquo\; has 
 long served as a reflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town
  iconography and handmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. 
 In Americana Reimagined artists reexamine this broad theme\, juxtaposing t
 he old and the new\, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh per
 spectives on what they mean today.\n\nJurors \n\nDonna Seager\, Donna Seag

 eption: Thursday\, March 12\, 5:30-7:30pm\n\nAbout States of Anxiety\, Sta
 tes of Hope: This exhibition presents a selection of works by artist Inez 
 Storer that reflect on the emotional\, cultural\, and political complexiti
 es of contemporary life. Building on themes explored in Americana Reimagin
 ed\, Storer's paintings offer a layered meditation on identity\, memory\, 
 and collective experience in times of uncertainty and transformation.\n\nT
 hrough her distinctive magical realist collage method\, Storer constructs 
 richly textured visual narratives that merge personal history with broader
  social realities. Her works are composed of fragments&mdash\;symbols\, im
 ages\, and artifacts drawn from her life and interests.\n\nStorer's painti
 ngs guide the viewer on a journey through both historical memory and inter
 nal landscapes. They balance darkness and light\, anxiety and hope.  She a
 sks us to reflect on the conditions of our moment. States of Anxiety\, Sta
 tes of Hope affirms art's capacity to illuminate struggle while nurturing 
 resilience\, empathy\, and connection.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense

 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B

DESCRIPTION:Join us at Snoopy's Home Ice for an evening of art and athleti
 cism of Dance on Ice.\n\nSnoopy's Home Ice\n\nMarch 13th 2026 at 7PM\n\nOl
 ympic Champion Gabriella Papadakis leads Ice Dance International's new tou
 r\, THE SEASONS&mdash\;a celebration of artistry\, athleticism\, and speed
  that turns the rink into a living stage. Papadakis joins 2-time United St
 ates Champion Alissa Czisny and skating artist Rohene Ward in a company of
  ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations 
 that move through four acts\; each sharing a story that takes the audience
  on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color\, emotion\, and momentum. 
  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps\, c
 risp footwork\, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's 
 2025 tour.\n\nPapadakis\, Czisny and Ward's presence elevates every phrase
 &mdash\;their power\, musical instinct\, and magnetic connection ignite th
 e audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: 
 athletic\, cinematic\, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 20
 26\, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance d
 ance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo\;THE SEAS
 ONS isn't just a show&mdash\;it's a pulse\, a spark\, a reminder that when
  blades meet music and movement meets heart\, the ice itself begins to sin
 g.&rdquo\; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be communit
 y events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI compa
 ny. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/
 cross overs\, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. C
 lasses will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth 
 and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and a
 dvance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chanc
 e for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast me
 mbers. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show\, regroup an
 d get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 he Buddha says that wise view is the starting point—it is also the culmi
 nation of awakening. Yet\, delusion comes camouflaged as wisdom. What we 
 do not yet understand shapes our view and obscures freedom. What are the p
 rocesses by which we realize and align with our deepest knowing?\n\nTogeth
 er\, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us 
 wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep at
 tention\, spiritual friendship\, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll 
 reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matte
 rs in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experie
 nce of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and l
 ove.\n\nDuring this day of practice\, we’ll offer guided and silent medi
 tation practice\, Dharma reflections\, and time for dialogue. All are welc

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M
 emory**\n\n***“Jordan Harrison’s gently uncanny play imagines a future
  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert
 wines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays\, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm\

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 s Hunter has since become one of the leading names in jazz\, recording 17 
 albums. Hunter is noted for playing custom-made seven and eight-string gui
 tars\, on which he simultaneously plays basslines\, rhythm guitar\, and so
 los. Critic Sean Westergaard describes Hunter's innovative guitar techniqu
 e as "mind-boggling ... he's an agile improviser with an ear for great ton
 e\, and always has excellent players alongside him in order to make great 
 music\, not to show off."

DESCRIPTION:Hello from in here to all you out there.\n\nFruit Bats’ eigh
 th LP opens with this invocation\, this call from an isolated vocal room t
 o your headphones somewhere out in the world. It’s a beckoning for your 
 trust and attention\, but also an assurance in lonely times—a distillati
 on of melancholy wrapped in a danceable waltz.\n\n“The Pet Parade\,” t
 he title track to Fruit Bats’ newest album\, might be a surprising openi
 ng track for longtime fans of Eric D. Johnson’s beloved indie folk-rock 
 project.The six-and-a-half-minute tone poem smolders and drones over just 
 two chords\, inspired by the strange and silly community events that he sa
 w growing up outside of Chicago\, in La Grange\, Illinois\, in which peopl
 e dressed up and showed off their pets. Decades later\, The Pet Parade eme
 rges in troubled times\, living within what Johnson refers to as the beaut
 y and absurdity of existence.\n\nAt times upbeat and reassuring \\(“Eagl
 es Below Us”\\) and at times quietly contemplative \\(“On the Avalon S
 tairs”\\)\, The Pet Parade marks a milestone for Johnson\, who celebrate
 s 20 years of Fruit Bats in 2021. In some ways still a cult band\, in othe
 r ways a time-tested act\, Fruit Bats has consistently earned enough small
  victories to carve out a career in a notoriously fickle scene.

DESCRIPTION:Guitar legend Charlie Hunter is widely considered one of the t
 op jazz bandleaders in the United States. As the "hip-hop" or "acid jazz" 
 movement of the mid-1990s gained momentum in the United States\, Charlie H
 unter was leading it in the San Francisco Bay Area. Young groups of avant-
 garde jazz musicians were mixing traditional jazz with hip-hop\, funk\, an
 d rock. Hunter was the first out of the pack of groups of the area to be r
 eleased on CD. "We study the past and practice the present\," Hunter told 
 Down Beat in 1994. That blend of past and present was what Hunter used to 
 push his award-winning trio towards many successful releases and tours. Hi
 s inventive use of a custom guitar earned him astute musicians as fans\, a
 nd his talent for creating infectious hip-hop dance grooves have made Hunt
 er's live shows legendary. Charlie Hunter has release 17 studio albums in 
 the last two decades. Hunter will be joined by Nate Clark on Sax and Marcu
 s Finnie on drums.

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:This is an experiential intimate workshop arranged in two circ
 les of 7 participants\, designed to promote individual and group healing o
 n physical\, mental\, emotional and spiritual levels.\n\nIt is a guided in
 teractive process\, in which each participant will experience a variety of
  techniques using light\, sound\, touch\, energy and ancient wisdom healin
 g techniques. The goal of this ceremony is to help each person come into a
  place of inner balance and alignment. ***Circles and groups will be chang
 ed approximately every 30-40 minutes allowing those in the center and the 
 outer circles to receive the Gift of Creation.***\n\n*“The concept of si
 multaneous wheels of group healing was awesome to observe and participate 
 with.  To observe Dr. Maria float from one circle to another identifying 
 specific notes/frequencies given to her by Spirits for each specific perso
 n was amazing. She also instructed people to aim certain colors to certain
  organs\, to allow for deeper healing to happen. The releases\, relief and
  raising of individual vibrations was absolutely amazing.”*\n\nWhat make
 s this event especially powerful is that it takes place within the amplifi
 ed bioenergetic field of the EESystem. As Dr. Maria speaks about cellular 
 resonance\, coherence\, and restoring balance\, guests will simultaneously
  be immersed in a scalar-energy environment designed to support optimal ce
 llular communication and energetic harmony. Whether you are new to her wor
 k or already familiar with energy-based healing\, this is an invitation to
  explore what becomes possible when wisdom\, frequency\, and intention ali
 gn. *We look forward to welcoming you into the field.*\n\n**About Dr Maria
  Michael**\n\nDr. Maria D. Michael is a world renowned and respected medic
 al intuitive\, channel\, empath\, healer\, psychic and teacher for over 40
  years. She has been awarded 5 advanced degrees (all Summa Cum Laude)\, in
 cluding a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. She has doctorate-level training
  in Neuropsychology and Special Education and extensive post-doctoral stud
 ies in Psychoanalysis and Jungian Psychology. Additionally\, Dr. Michael i
 s trained and experienced in EMDR\, Hypnotherapy\, LENS Neurofeedback\, Ne

  Native ceremonies and doctored alongside Lakota Medicine people. She has 
 been sought out worldwide for her powerful Medicine Energies and Healing a
 bilities. Learn more about Dr Maria Michael at: https://drmariamichael.com
 /\n\n**BELIEFS**\n\nDr. Maria Michael believes that we all come from the s
 ame Creation\, and that everyone has the potential and capacity to communi
 cate with Creation. While the Lakota call Creation “The Great Mystery\,
 ” other traditions may refer to Creation\, with names such as\, “God\,
 ” “the Universe\,” “Allah\,” “Yahweh\,” “Divine Love\,” 
 “Universal Love” or “Cosmic Consciousness.”\n\nWe not only choose 
 our human families\, but also we choose\, initially at least\, our own uni
 que form or tradition of understanding and communication with the Great My
 stery. No form or tradition is better than another. Humans are merely atte
 mpting to understand “That” which is beyond comprehension.\n\nAll mess
 ages from the Great Mystery are compassionate and loving\, even though at 
 times these messages may appear difficult. Creation’s message appears to
  us in whatever way we choose to comprehend it. Sometimes\, we are only ca
 pable of comprehending deeply sensitive messages that resound in our heart
 s\, and sometimes only strong and “seemingly” shocking messages penetr
 ate our defenses. This loving Spirit guides us to remove those obstacles t
 hat stand in our way of becoming all that Creation and We intended us to b
 e.

DESCRIPTION:Take a guided hike to the historic orchard\, now part of Jack 
 London State Historic Park\, and learn about its remarkable restoration. 
  Along the way\, keep an eye out for seasonal wildflowers and perhaps the 
 first delicate blossoms on early blooming fruit trees.\n\nOriginally plant
 ed between 1908 and 1912\, the orchard flourished in Jack London’s time 
 before being abandoned for many years. Today\, thanks to dedicated restora
 tion efforts\, it can once again be enjoyed by all who walk its trails.\n\
 nThe experience begins with an overview presented by Eric Metz\, Director 
 of Operations\, who will share the history of the orchard and the challeng
 es involved in its revival. From there\, participants will hike through re
 dwoods and mixed oak woodlands on a moderate\, six-mile round-trip trek to
  the orchard.\n\n At the orchard\, guests will tour the areas that have b
 een thoughtfully revitalized and learn about unique obstacles overcome in 
 restoring this landscape.

DESCRIPTION:with James Baraz\, MA\n\nSpring is a natural time to reflect o
 n what we are holding on to and what may be ready to be released. Just wha
 t does the phrase “let go” mean? Renunciation (*nekkhama* in Pāli)\,
  one of the ten perfections\, is often misunderstood as sacrifice—someth
 ing we should do because it’s “good for us.” In early Buddhist teach
 ings\, *nekkhama* is described not as deprivation\, but as a letting go 
 that supports genuine contentment and well-being\, rooted in seeing more c
 learly what leads to suffering and what leads to freedom.\n\nDuring this d
 aylong program\, which includes periods of guided silent sitting and walki
 ng meditation\, participants will explore how habitual grasping—to thoug
 hts\, personal stories\, possessions\, roles\, and a sense of control—sh
 apes inner experience and contributes to stress. Drawing from contemplativ
 e teachings and incorporating perspectives from psychology on attachment a
 nd habitual mental patterns\, our reflections and practices will focus on 
 meeting these patterns with awareness and kindness\, loosening unhelpful s
 elf-stories\, softening the impulse to control\, and cultivating generosit
 y. This program is educational in nature and welcomes both new and experie
 nced practitioners.

DESCRIPTION:In this 4 week course\, participants will learn a unique appro
 ach to watercolor\, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experi
 ence when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will f
 ocus on strengthening one’s observational skills\, giving the artist a f
 oundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering
  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women's presenc

 -size sculptural work by resident artists Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\,
  the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as 
 something lived\, embodied\, and deeply personal. At the heart of the gall
 ery stands a mountain lioness woman - a guardian figure shaped by two arti
 sts working together\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and visio
 n. Surrounding this central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that 
 reflect their own relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and sel
 fhood. Rather than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites vie
 wers to witness many expressions of strength - quiet and fierce\, ancestra
 l and contemporary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of wo
 men artists and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and con
 nection. Opening Reception: March 1\, 12-4pm Gallery Hours: Sundays in Mar

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists 
 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feel
 s like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way
 . His voice is raw and real\, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’
 s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest\, and that’s
  exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Am
 ericana\; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie\, blues lege
 nds like Howlin’ Wolf\,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe\, an
 d master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and c
 onnects audiences\, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren
 ’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s so
 ft and haunting\, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay wi
 th you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sou
 nd. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness\, conn
 ection\, love\, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band s
 how\, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOv
 er the years\, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless to
 uring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists 
 like Shakey Graves\, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\, Sarah Jarosz\, and Alic
 e O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock\, SXSW\, and High Si
 erra Music Festival\, but his focus has always been on making music that m
 eans something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending y
 ears on the road\, self-funding his albums\, and navigating the ups and do
 wns of life as an independent artist\, husband\, and father. But through i
 t all\, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music th
 at connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real\, that makes
  you stop and listen\, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura

 , participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intended to al
 leviate the frustration that many experience when learning this beautiful 
 yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s observation
 al drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build t
 heir paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist t
 o see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sa
 mpling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and e
 xperienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawin
 g subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah 
 Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her uniq
 ue approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. Th
 is class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicing observ
 ational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessio
 ns\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and bu
 ild muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its
  own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials a
 re provided.

DESCRIPTION:**Artificial Remembrance: The Intersection of Technology and M

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen
 tary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intert

UID:260224W1JwRxyyzkuZP6tqOhv9Hw
DESCRIPTION:Born in San Mateo\, California in 1969\, Lindell spent countle
 ss hours in San Francisco\, soaking up the musical sounds of the city\, ev
 entually leading him to pick up first the bass and then the guitar and har
 monica. With a love of music and skateboarding\, Lindell formed a few punk
 y garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened t
 o the deep blues of Buddy Guy\, Junior Wells\, Jimmy Reed and Albert King 
 before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions\, Stevie Wonder a
 nd Donny Hathaway\, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. 
 After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands\, 
 Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern Cali
 fornia audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam s
 essions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended
  his shows\, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mi
 nd\, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999\, where he quickly discovered t
 he pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank d
 ive bars of Gretna and Algiers\, where he befriended many older area music
 ians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' 
 finest players\, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Br
 own \\(War\\)\, Stanton Moore \\(Galactic\\) and Johnny Vidacovich \\(Prof
 essor Longhair\, Astral Project\\) often joined him on stage. Galactic bas
 sist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well\, and word of Lindell's immense
  talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis\, Th
 e Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embr
 acing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell\, "It'
 s a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans." Since 2
 003\, in addition to his own gigs\, Lindell regularly joins forces with Iv
 an Neville\, Moore and Mercurio \\(when time and schedules permit\\) and t
 hey perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The We
 ather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artis
 t. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs\, laid back grooves and hoo
 k-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown\, Neville and Moore
 . Critics across the country went wild\, with reviews and features in Reli
 x\, OffBeat\, Guitar Player\, Down Beat\, The New Yorker\, The New York Pr
 ess and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician
  magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections 
 did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash\, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast H
 ighway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Nigh
 t With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified
  his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his son
 gs have appeared in films and television shows\, including Boston Legal an
 d Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminar
 ies\, including John Fogerty\, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\n
 With Revolution In Your Heart\, Lindell was more than ready to come home t
 o Alligator. "The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusin
 g on what I do and have such a great team behind me\," he says. Upon relea
 se of the album\, Lindell and his band will tour heavily\, reuniting with 
 old friends and\, as always\, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic dec
 lares Lindell a singular talent\, saying\, "He plays soulful\, funk-drench
 ed\, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwr
 iter\, impressive guitarist\, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This 
 is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not
  just easy\, but natural."

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 d tradition in book arts. Popular during the late 19th and early 20th cent
 uries\, this art-making technique was an advanced form of stencil printing

 hroughout the day\, an assortment of materials will be on hand to create s
 tencils\; different brushes and their effects will be examined\; and vario
 us ‘dry pigments’ and papers will be investigated as students expand t
 heir pochoir skills. The instructor will also lead a discussion on how stu
 dents can creatively incorporate pochoir into their own artwork\, includin
 g books\, prints\, cards\, and more!\n\nStudents will work on a set of not

DESCRIPTION:with Kristin Neff\, PhD and Caverly Morgan\n\nSelf-compassion 
 helps us let go of identification with the belief that we’re not good en
 ough. With its warm support\, we learn to untangle from our negative thoug
 hts and emotions and embrace our inherent wholeness.\n\nOur unconscious co
 nditioning—influenced by our family\, genetics\, and culture—often tel
 ls us we’re inadequate and need to be different in order to be happy. Co
 mpassion helps us remember who we truly are versus who we’ve been condit
 ioned to be. It transforms our contracted and limited view of ourselves\, 
 opening to a larger\, more connected\, and powerful sense of loving presen
 ce.\n\nResearch shows that self-compassion is strongly linked to psycholog
 ical and physical health\, but our conditioning works against being kind t
 o ourselves. In this program\, researcher Kristin Neff teams up with medit
 ation teacher Caverly Morgan to explore self-compassion from a scientific 
 and contemplative lens\, so that we can respond to difficult moments with 
 greater warmth and perspective.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:“If I was forced to categorize it\, I’d call it modern fol
 k. It’s powerful\, romantic\, and giddy. And the two are insanely infect
 ious together onstage\, like a musical and a personal love fest all at onc
 e.”  – Huffington Post  With more than a dozen albums and over a thous
 and shows between them\, Ty Greenstein and Ingrid Elizabeth of Mouths of B
 abes are no strangers to the contemporary folk music scene. For years\, th
 eir respective bands Girlyman and Coyote Grace captivated thousands of loy
 al fans as they criss-crossed the country\, rocked festival main stages\, 
 and toured with the likes of the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Now\, as M
 ouths of Babes\, Ty and Ingrid have distilled the very best of the songwri
 ting\, musicianship\, and humor of their previous groups into a new duo th
 at brings more style and depth than ever before.  Mouths of Babes recorded
  their highly anticipated first full-length album\, Brighter In the Dark a
 t Prairie Sun Studios in northern California last summer on the strength o
 f a wildly successful\, 800-backer\, $56\,000 Kickstarter campaign. Releas
 ed in January 2017\, the self-produced album contains twelve original song
 s with contrasting themes of light and dark\, tragedy and comedy\, persona
 l and political. Mixed by Stewart Lerman \\(Dar Williams\, Bob Dylan\\)\, 
 Brighter features guest appearances from Birds of Chicago\, Tania Elizabet
 h \\(The Avett Brothers\\)\, Mai Bloomfield \\(Jason Mraz\\) and others.  
 No Depression writes\, “Mouths of Babes could never have predicted how n
 ecessary Brighter In The Dark \\[would be\\] in a post-Trump world. The al
 bum title is fitting. We need music that shows people struggling against s
 ocial expectations\, that reminds us that we all have the resilience we ne
 ed to make it through.” Thinking Lyrically blog gives the album 9 stars 
 out of 10: "An eclectic arsenal of songs\, showcasing their knack for fusi
 ng blues\, folk\, and soul with poetic lyrics \\[and\\] great choruses...a
 n incredibly versatile record. One of my new favourite listens.”  The ke
 y to the Mouths of Babes magic is in the contrast\; the differences in bot
 h their songwriting and personal styles makes for an unusually satisfying 
 yin and yang. Of their live show\, the Chicago Tribune writes\, “They of
 fer unique counterpoints to one another…the laidback Ty\, nattily dresse
 d in a tie and crisp suit jacket\, has a rich\, lovely alto. Ingrid\, clad
  in a sultry pink satin mini-dress\, is a sassy chanteuse with a lilting s
 oprano. Trading jokes and sharing elegant harmonies\, the two women displa
 y an intuitive professional bond.” They easily switch off lead vocals an
 d play a wide array of instruments\, with Ty on acoustic and electric guit
 ars and foot percussion\, and Ingrid playing upright bass\, ukulele\, and 
 cajon.  Onstage\, Ty makes a quiet impression as a gifted lyricist\, talen
 ted multi-instrumentalist\, and magnetic presence. “The poignant honesty
  that Ty brings to \\[her\\] tunes gives them an emotional intensity that
 ’s as bracing as it is moving\,” says Relix Magazine.  The Americana G
 azette writes\, “Ty’s practice of extending metaphors out toward a pre
 cipice keeps an unpredictable edge to her songs. Most writers would stop a
 t the easy close. Ty jumps\, leaving much to the imagination\, to powerful
  effect.” Ingrid\, a natural performer\, easily commands audiences with 
 her larger-than-life sassiness and professional dancer’s grace. "With a 
 background in burlesque\, sex-education\, and good ol' American roots musi
 c\," writes Kithfolk\, "Ingrid Elizabeth brings a ton of charisma to her p
 erformances." Curve Magazine calls Ingrid “the fiery redheaded bassist..
 .the unabashed\, unapologetic woman who isn’t afraid to yell it all from
  the rooftops.”  Both Ingrid and Ty come from notable musical families\,
  and their influences \\(namely\, 60’s folk music and Motown\\) are deep
 ly embedded in Mouths of Babes’ sound. Ty’s father\, Ron Greenstein\, 
 is a member of the legendary folk harmony trio The Chad Mitchell Trio \\(w
 here John Denver got his start\\)\, while Ingrid’s uncle Tom Eyen wrote 
 the world-famous\, Tony-winning musical Dreamgirls.  MTV News writes: “T
 he songs Mouths of Babes writes and performs together fuse blues\, folk\, 
 and soul\, and the depth of emotion found in their lyrics is reminiscent o
 f all that’s moving about the Dreamgirls soundtrack.”  “Hands down t
 he best new music I've heard in years. It's damn near perfect. The instrum
 ental performances\, the arrangements\, the production\, the songwriting a
 nd singing…this is the kind of music that makes you glad to be alive. 
 ” – Michael Mullane\, Cafe Veritas Mouths of Babes is Ty Greenstein \\
 (Girlyman\\) & Ingrid Elizabeth \\(Coyote Grace\\). Equal parts celebratio
 n and blues. Folky\, soulful deliciousness. Get some.

DESCRIPTION:In MovingWriting workshops\, we play with movement/dance and
  words to help us connect with our deep and creative selves in the company
  of a supportive circle. Giving voice to our own stories and witnessing th
 e stories of others brings healing\, aliveness\, and connection with other
 s.\n\nNo moving or writing experience necessary!\n\nHere's what a few rece
 nt MovingWriting participants had to say about their experience:\n\n“L
 oretta's well-crafted writing prompts sparked a writer inside me that I di
 dn't know I had… I left feeling invigorated\, accomplished and proud of 
 myself for trying something new.”\n\n“I'm neither a writer nor a dance
 r\, but Loretta made it easy to put aside my inhibitions and let my emotio
 nal body lead the way… I recommend this class for anybody at all!”\n\n
 "It felt delicious to dive into my creative moving and language self with 
 others. For days after\, I felt both emptied and filled up creatively in w
 ays that I hadn’t felt in a long time."\n\n"I felt refreshed\, renewed\,
  and like I had processed some emotional blockages… The paths were opene
 d and the words just flowed."\n\nCome move and write with us! Visit www.Mo

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

DESCRIPTION:with Kristin Neff\, PhD and Caverly Morgan\n\nSelf-compassion 
 helps us let go of identification with the belief that we’re not good en
 ough. With its warm support\, we learn to untangle from our negative thoug
 hts and emotions and embrace our inherent wholeness.\n\nOur unconscious co
 nditioning—influenced by our family\, genetics\, and culture—often tel
 ls us we’re inadequate and need to be different in order to be happy. Co
 mpassion helps us remember who we truly are versus who we’ve been condit
 ioned to be. It transforms our contracted and limited view of ourselves\, 
 opening to a larger\, more connected\, and powerful sense of loving presen
 ce.\n\nResearch shows that self-compassion is strongly linked to psycholog
 ical and physical health\, but our conditioning works against being kind t
 o ourselves. In this program\, researcher Kristin Neff teams up with medit
 ation teacher Caverly Morgan to explore self-compassion from a scientific 
 and contemplative lens\, so that we can respond to difficult moments with 
 greater warmth and perspective.

DESCRIPTION:In this 4 week course\, participants will learn a unique appro
 ach to watercolor\, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experi
 ence when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will f
 ocus on strengthening one’s observational skills\, giving the artist a f
 oundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering
  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

  solution for a person in mourning: the recreation of someone you love as 
 an artificial intelligence.”* —Kate Wyver\, The Guardian**\n\n**In *Ma
 rjorie Prime*\, playwright Jordan Harrison delves into the intricate dance
  between human memory and artificial intelligence. Set in the not-so-dista
 nt future\, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie\, whose mind is 
 gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections\, her
  family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projectio
 n of her late husband\, Walter\, programmed to retell the stories of their
  shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime\, the lines between 
 authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur\, prompting profound 
 questions about identity\, the reliability of our recollections\, and the 
 extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. 
 This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choo
 se to remember\, what we wish to forget\, and how the digital age reshapes
  the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has ga
 rnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commen

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women's presenc

 -size sculptural work by resident artists Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\,
  the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as 
 something lived\, embodied\, and deeply personal. At the heart of the gall
 ery stands a mountain lioness woman - a guardian figure shaped by two arti
 sts working together\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and visio
 n. Surrounding this central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that 
 reflect their own relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and sel
 fhood. Rather than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites vie
 wers to witness many expressions of strength - quiet and fierce\, ancestra
 l and contemporary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of wo
 men artists and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and con
 nection. Opening Reception: March 1\, 12-4pm Gallery Hours: Sundays in Mar

 d\, author Karin Argoud will donate 5% net profit to the Save The Children
  Fund Sweet little Petite Mouse doesn’t want to nap \\(much like a child
  you probably know\\). With one tiny nose and two scurrying feet\, she’l
 l slip through your fingers! But with a little help from little hands\, yo
 u can make sure Petite Mouse gets some rest. With soft illustrations\, a f
 un counting element\, and finger holes for extra delight\, Petite Mouse Ta
 kes a Nap is the perfect naptime book to turn wiggly fingers into sleepy e
 yes. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Karin Argoud is an actress best known for her role a
 s Sonya Harper in the series Mama’s Family. She is also a freelance news
  journalist\, an author\, and the happily married mother of two daughters 
 who never really loved nap time. It was always quite the undertaking to ge
 t them to fall asleep. But she knew how important it was for them\, and wo
 uld sometimes go through stacks of books and songs to get them to fais dod
 o\, which means go to sleep in French. How she would have treasured a book
  like Petite Mouse Takes a Nap! She is a first-generation American and is 
 proud of her family's French American citizenship. Her loving\, wonderful 
 parents were of French\, German\, and Lebanese descent\, and she was raise
 d hearing fairy tales\, games\, and songs from those countries. She\, in t
 urn\, raised her daughters speaking French and immersed them in fairy tale
 s\, plays\, and songs. She and her husband sent their daughters to Waldorf
  schools and raised them without television\, their imaginations fed with 
 storybooks\, imaginative play\, and puppetry. Petite Mouse Takes a Nap is 
 her first children's book\, but she has more in mind.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:On the porch of her one-time Nashville home\, Liz Cooper had a
  multimedia project that combined two of her loves: lips and cigarettes. S
 he painted her own lips with red paint and kissed a canvas two or three hu
 ndred times\, later dotting them with the detritus left behind in ashtrays
  by her friends. An overlap of intimacy\, indulgence\, cheekiness\, and se
 nsuality\, the piece complements Cooper’s roiling second record\, Hot Sa
 ss. Over jagged\, frenetic guitar parts\, Cooper sets expectations aflame.
  Her songs unfurl like smoke spiraling off an incense cone late in the aft
 ernoon\, with Cooper pushing deeper into psychedelic openness\, punk feroc
 ity\, and beyond.\n\nHot Sass marks multiple departures for Liz Cooper: fr
 om her nine-year home of Nashville\, from her band addendum of the Stamped
 e\, from any genre-burdened expectations she’d accumulated over the year
 s. After heavy touring in support of 2018’s Window Flowers\, where her s
 ongs stretched out in live settings\, she felt constricted by the American
 a-adjacent associations that the Stampede carried. So with her bandmates
 ’ blessing\, she dropped the moniker\, pursuing sounds and songs that le
 t her chase the inspiration lent to her by the likes of Courtney Love\, Lo
 u Reed\, and David Bowie. In Burlington\, Vermont\, Cooper and her cohort 
 —Ryan Usher\, Joe Bisirri\, and Michael Libramento—recorded Hot Sass a
 t Little Jamaica\, the personal studio/private residence of producer Benny
  Yurco \\(Michael Nau\\).

  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.
