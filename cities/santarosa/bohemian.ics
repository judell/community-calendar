 LE OF 2024 NAMED A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY NPR/FRESH AIR\, WASHINGTON POS
 T\, THE NEW YORKER\, AND TIME MAGAZINE ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVORITE BOOK
 S OF 2023 "A murder mystery locked inside a Great American Novel . . . Cha
 rming\, smart\, heart-blistering\, and heart-healing." -Danez Smith\, The 
 New York Times Book Review "We all need-we all deserve-this vibrant\, love
 -affirming novel that bounds over any difference that claims to separate u
 s." -Ron Charles\, The Washington Post In 1972\, when workers in Pottstown
 \, Pennsylvania\, were digging the foundations for a new development\, the
  last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. 
 Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secret
 s kept by the residents of Chicken Hill\, the dilapidated neighborhood whe
 re immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambi
 tions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived whe
 n Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Groc
 ery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize 
 him\, it was Chona and Nate Timblin\, the Black janitor at Moshe's theater
  and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill\, who wo
 rked together to keep the boy safe. As these characters' stories overlap a
 nd deepen\, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins o
 f white\, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. Whe
 n the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and th
 e part the town's white establishment played in it\, McBride shows us that
  even in dark times\, it is love and community-heaven and earth-that susta

 an extremely fun and rewarding form of dance. Tap Dance originated in the 
 19th century through a fusion of African and Irish dance styles\, becoming
  a unique American art form in the melting pot of New York City. It develo
 ped through percussive footwork\, initially on plantations and in urban ce
 llars\, and later gained widespread popularity through minstrel shows\, va
 udeville\, and Hollywood musicals. Innovators like  Bill "Bojangles" Robin
 son \, the  Nicholas Brothers \, Eleanor Powell\, Fred Astaire\, Gene Kell
 y to name just a few\, who shaped its evolution\, which continues today wi
 th new fusions in contemporary dance. May 26\, Bojangle's birthday\, is Na
 tional Tap Dance Day. Starr Hergenrather has been teaching Theatre and Dan
 ce for over 54 years\, dancing for 70 years\, which is amazing since she i
 s only 45 years old! She received her Theatre Arts and Teaching Credential
 s in 1971 from Denver\, CO. Starr has taught theatre/creative dramatics/im
 provisation/dance to all ages and directed and produced theatre for many\,
  many years. She and her family moved to Sebastopol in 1983. In 1987\, she
  received her Dance credential and degree from SSU. Starr loves the theatr
 e and dance and everything about them. She has performed on stage and in f
 ilm throughout her teaching career. Before joining the staff at Analy in 2
 001 where she became the Theatre Arts Program Director and taught one danc
 e class starting in 2010\, when the high school lost its Dance instructor 
 due to No Child Left Behind\, she taught at Brookhaven School from 1990-20
 01 teaching a myriad of subjects\, including Theatre and Dance\, and Rinco
 n Valley Junior High School from 1987-1997\, as BJ Van Noy's choreographer
  and asst. director of her Music Program. Starr's tap mentor was a Vaudevi
 lle and later Broadway song and Dance man by the name of Jack Williams. St
 arr studied with Jack for almost 20 years.\, until his waning years. Tap\,
  which is a magical form of dance\, btw\, is Starr's first dance love\, ne
 xt to swing\, salsa\, and partner dancing\, and then just plain social\, w
 ild hippie dancing at concerts. Starr also teaches Private Tap Lessons for
  any level dancer. Starr has a studio at her home.

 rtists\, celebrate the show and welcome the season of love. Take part in t
 he Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery arti
 st.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists\, **Linda Ba
 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long

 :\n\nChef Carlos was born in El Salvador\, where his passion for cooking b
 egan in the kitchen with his grandmother and mother\, creating simple yet 
 flavorful family meals. After his family migrated to the United States\, C
 arlos worked at his uncle’s restaurant in Sebastopol\, further deepening
  his love for food. While attending Piner High School\, in Santa Rosa\, he
  joined a newly established culinary program\, where he learned profession
 al kitchen skills and participated in local food competitions with renowne
 d chefs like Guy Fieri and Rich Nolan. In 2008\, his high school team won 
 first place in the Santa Rosa Iron Chef competition. During this time\, Ca
 rlos also took on the responsibility of cooking family meals\, solidifying
  his dream of becoming a chef. \n\nAfter graduating\, Carlos started at J
 ackson’s in Santa Rosa as a dishwasher but quickly worked his way up thr
 ough various kitchen roles\, impressing his colleagues with his dedication
  and skill. His hard work caught the attention of two restaurateurs\, who 
 offered him a sous chef position at their new restaurant. While thriving i
 n this role\, Carlos realized his passion for showcasing Latin cuisine and
  decided to pursue further education. He earned an associate degree from S
 anta Rosa Junior College’s culinary program and took additional courses 
 at the Culinary Institute of America \\(CIA\\) Greystone\, St. Helena focu
 sing on pastry and butchery. Next up\, Chef Carlos was the head of food de
 velopment at La Tortilla Factory in Santa Rosa\, creating new recipes and 
 products. \n\nAt 24\, Carlos saved $60\,000 from playing in a popular\, a
 ward winning family band and flipping a house with his father. In 2014\, h
 e found a small restaurant space in Healdsburg and\, with his father as a 
 partner\, opened Guiso Latin Fusion on October 15\, 2015. Drawing inspirat
 ion from Central and South America\, Carlos built the restaurant’s reput
 ation organically\, eventually gaining recognition from a San Francisco Ch
 ronicle food writer\, which propelled his success.\n\nFor Carlos\, food is
  art\, and every dish tells a story rooted in his culture and childhood. H
 e strives to create a family-like atmosphere in his restaurant\, where gue
 sts feel connected and leave with memorable experiences. Beyond running hi
 s restaurant\, Carlos mentors young chefs\, develops a rosé wine brand ca
 lled BELI’S\, and continues to “Live a Flavorful Life.” His motto\, 
 “Cook My Culture\,” reflects his deep connection to his roots and his 
 passion for creating meaningful culinary experiences.\n\nAWARDS\n\n\\+Best

 ctually podcast and operates a UC-Davis research lab that studies attracti
 on and relationships.\n\nCome to Napa Yards for a talk by Dr. Eastwick tha
 t will give you a much more sophisticated understanding of matters of the 
 heart. \n\nDrawing from pathbreaking research—including original experi
 ments from his own lab—he’ll offer the take that relationship success 
 hinges on compatibility rather than finding someone who meets some univers
 al ideal of a good partner.\n\nHe’ll show that while popularity factors 
 into first impressions\, its influence fades fast. When evaluating mutual 
 friends and acquaintances they’ve known for months\, single people barel
 y agree in their ratings of who is or isn’t desirable as a dating partne
 r.\n\nAlthough men and women occasionally say they want different things o
 ut of romance\, gender differences evaporate once we assess what men and w
 omen actually want. Attraction from ancestral times through the present is
  best depicted as a process of finding—and\, often\, creating—a compat
 ible relationship.\n\nDr. Eastwick will show how the traits we often look 
 for in a partner—personality\, lifestyle\, values\, and humor—are poor
  predictors of compatibility. Instead\, lasting attraction is built throug
 h the gradual forging of strong attachment bonds\, through mundane moments
  in which people offer each other a “safe haven” and “secure base.
 ”\n\nDistilling evolutionary biology\, anthropology\, and psychology int
 o accessible insights\, he’ll explain why we so often choose dating stra
 tegies that make us miserable and how we can use a more evolved approach.

 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b

  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th

 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp

  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

 L BESTSELLER | A GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK | A WASHINGTON POST T
 OP 10 BOOK OF THE YEAR | A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2024 “A laugh-
 out-loud cultural comedy… This is the New Great American Novel\, and Dan
 zy Senna has set the standard.” –LA Times “Funny\, foxy and fleet…
 The jokes are good\, the punches land\, the dialogue is tart.” – Dwigh
 t Garner\, The New York Times A brilliant take on love and ambition\, fail
 ure and reinvention\, and the racial-identity-industrial complex from the 
 bestselling author of Caucasia. Jane has high hopes that her life is about
  to turn around. After a long\, precarious stretch bouncing among sketchy 
 rentals and sublets\, she and her family are living in luxury for a year\,
  house-sitting in the hills above Los Angeles. The gig magically coincides
  with Jane’s sabbatical\, giving her the time and space she needs to fin
 ish her second novel—a centuries-spanning epic her artist husband\, Lenn
 y\, dubs her “mulatto War and Peace.” Finally\, some semblance of stab
 ility and success seems to be within her grasp. But things don’t work ou
 t quite as hoped. Desperate for a plan B\, like countless writers before h
 er Jane turns her gaze to Hollywood. When she finagles a meeting with Hamp
 ton Ford\, a hot producer with a major development deal at a streaming net
 work\, he seems excited to work with a “real writer\,” and together th
 ey begin to develop “the Jackie Robinson of biracial comedies.” Things
  finally seem to be going right for Jane—until they go terribly wrong. F
 unny\, piercing\, and page turning\, Colored Television is Senna’s most 
 on-the-pulse\, ambitious\, and rewarding novel yet. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Danzy
  Senna is the author of four previous works of fiction\, including the bes
 tselling Caucasia and\, most recently\, New People\, as well as a memoir. 
 The recipient of numerous awards and honors\, she teaches writing at the U
 niversity of Southern California.

DESCRIPTION:Mama’s Broke is a powerful folk duo that deliver a compellin
 g performance with heart and raw energy. Although highly influenced by the
 ir Canadian roots\, Lisa and Amy are based out of nowhere and everywhere. 
 \n\nTheir two strong voices blend to create haunting harmonies\, while the
 y artfully juggle fiddle\, banjo\, guitar and mandolin\, and incorporate t
 raditional dance and foot percussion into their performance. Their origina
 l – and often dark – compositions push the boundaries of tradition and
  the constraints of genre. Drawing from old-time\, Quebecois\, blues\, pun
 k\, Celtic\, Balkan and  doom metal\, they create a soundscape that is bot
 h familiar and new. \n\nSince forming the band in 2014\, Mama’s Broke ha
 s been gaining momentum fast \; having already completed two European\, an
 d several Canadian and U.S. tours. They have performed in a wide range of 
 venues\, from circus shows in New Orleans\, to pirate ships in Amsterdam\,
  to concert halls in Ireland\, to theatres in Brooklyn. In this way\, they
  stay true to the transient nature of folklore\, as they travel the world 
 sharing and collecting song.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books welcomes friend and beloved lo
 cal author Eirinie Carson to Petaluma for the launch of her hypnotic new G
 othic thriller - Bloodfire\, Baby: A Novel! Join us for a chilling reading
  and discussion followed by an audience Q&A and book signing with photo op
 portunities. This is a free event\, registration required due to limited s
 eating. A maternal gothic tale of new motherhood and the torment of a cent
 uries-old haunting Before the shadow appeared\, Sofia thought mothering wo
 uld be all sun-drenched light and white linen sheets\, as seen advertised 
 by the momfluencers of Instagram. In her gorgeous home anchored in a posh 
 suburb\, far removed from her origins\, Sofia revels in her success. Mothe
 rhood seems like the natural next step\, but when her husband travels for 
 a work trip\, leaving Sofia all alone with their unnamed three-week-old ba
 by\, she can't quite square how mothering falls solely in her lap. Nobody 
 seems able or willing to help her: not her husband\, not her best friend\,
  and certainly not the zealot mother she cut off long ago. Her postpartum 
 reality is overtaken by an ominous figure. Sleep-deprivation collides with
  a darkness that creeps in and begins to spread\, threatening to consume h
 er entirely. As her grip on reality slips away\, Sofia learns of an insidi
 ous haunting that has plagued the eldest daughters in her family for gener
 ations. With her baby's safety on the line\, Sofia realizes she must confr
 ont her murky history or risk losing more than just the veneer of perfecti
 on. Author: Eirinie Carson is a member of the Writers Grotto in San Franci
 sco and a frequent contributor to Mother magazine. Her work has also appea
 red in LitHub\, Notre Dame Review\, Mortal Mag\, Electric Literature\, The
  Sonora Review\, and others. Bloodfire\, Baby is her first novel. Praise: 
 ‘Eirinie Carson's BLOODFIRE\, BABY arrives kicking and screaming with fl
 ames in its hair and lightning in its hands as it heralds a new powerful l
 iterary voice being born. Raw\, honest\, mysterious and ultimately courage
 ous\, BLOODIFRE\, BABY is the book that will peel away your misconceptions
  and lay bare the power and the beauty of the feminine mystique. Not to be
  missed.' -S.A. Cosby author of King of Ashes ‘BLOODFIRE\, BABY is a fer
 ocious\, hypnotic descent that burrows under your skin and refuses to let 
 go. Carson expertly plunges us into the sleepless\, paranoid depths of new
  motherhood where ancestral ghosts collide with the present-day terror of 
 a negotiable reality. A fever dream\, a psychological thriller\, and a whi
 p smart commentary on modern motherhood\, BLOODFIRE\, BABY is destined to 
 be a novel people press into each other's hands\, whispering 'you have to 
 read this.'-Chelsea Bieker\, author of Madwoman ‘The most nuanced examin
 ation of postpartum I have ever read\, BLOODFIRE\, BABY spans continents a
 nd generations in its kaleidoscopic portrayal of motherhood\, race\, and c
 lass. Rarely is a novel as propulsive as it is illuminating\, but this is 
 uncannily infused with a heavy\, knowing dread that intensifies with each 
 turn of the page. That expert pacing--along with the novel's exquisite lan
 guage\, depth\, and scope--announces Eirinie Carson as a refreshing and es
 sential new voice in contemporary fiction.' -Margaret Wilkerson Sexton\, a
 uthor of On The Rooftop ‘BLOODFIRE\, BABY is a novel of crackling honest
 y\, daring\, and vigor that only a mother could write. Carson's relentless
 \, page-turning plot weaves the frank\, uninhibited sensualities of mother
 hood and body horror into a thick\, powerful rope\, then ties you tightly 
 to the page right alongside our heroine. Carson's novel is a wild\, transf
 ormative ride written in neon from the first page to the last. Yes\, only 
 a mother could create this haunting\, mighty book\, but everyone must read
  it.' --Savala Nolan\, Don't Let it Get You Down: Essays on Race\, Gender\
 , and the Body

 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb
 aud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid\, an OLLI instructor for Son

  discussion\, we will look at his famous works\, review his life\, and lea
 rn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the 
 SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry D

 realm of traditional sitar. As a kid\, Will had an insatiable curiosity fo
 r exploring the world's music. He found profound depth in the traditional 
 music of the world and nurtured that itch by studying World Music Performa
 nce at the California institute of the Arts\, completing his World Music p
 erformance MFA in 2013. Since then\, Will's musical journey has been rich 
 and diverse. He believes passionately that music is essential to all of hu
 manity. Hearing the rich tapestry of melody for sitar\, guitar\, cello\, s
 axophone and tabla in the Integration Ensemble connects audiences to the r
 ichness of the world's traditions in a vibrant\, fresh expression of human
 ity's greatest gift\, music! The ensemble performs this dynamic music at v
 enues and festivals internationally.  Learn more about Will at  willmarshm

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, FEBRUARY 7\, 2026\, 3 – 5 pm: Join in to meet the a
 rtists\, celebrate the show and welcome the season of love. Take part in t
 he Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery arti
 st.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists\, **Linda Ba
 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S
 treet\, Healdsburg\, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.

DESCRIPTION:with Amana Brembry Johnson\n\nThere is a knowing that lives be
 neath thought\, an ancient intelligence woven into the fabric of our being
 . The Buddha taught that everything needed for liberating the heart is alr
 eady here\, within this body. The path is not about becoming different\, b
 ut remembering all that has been obscured by the habits of conditioning an
 d forgetfulness.\n\nBy returning to the body as a living archive that has 
 never stopped guiding us\, we reconnect with the sacred inheritance of who
 leness—a continuity passed down through the Buddhadharma and the unbroke
 n line of ancestors whose memories flow within us. This daylong will inclu
 de silent sitting meditation\, Dharma reflections\, breath awareness\, and
  gentle interpersonal connections. During our time together we will reconn
 ect with what is already ours\, a sense of belonging\, spacious presence\,
  and the dignity of simply being alive. Open to both new and experienced 
 practitioners.

DESCRIPTION:Railroad historian and former Northwestern Pacific and Souther
 n Pacific officer Fred Codoni will discuss the history of the railroad in 
 Sonoma County\, from the early horse-drawn streetcars – ‘horse car lin
 es’ – to the formation of the Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railroad \\(P&SR\\
 ) that went through Sebastopol. The current West County Museum in downtown
  Sebastopol was the terminal.  Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14\,000
  railroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set 
 of artifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transp
 ortation\, manufacturing\, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad 
 industry since 1956\, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pa
 cific Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum\, Fred often ran
  P&SR passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junc
 tion\, the only remaining operating car from that railroad.\n\nThis talk i
 s a project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society. It will be 
 preceded by a short update by the society board about what is happening at
  the Historical Society.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 Donna Emerson and Gerald Fleming\, with selected readings from their recen
 t poetry collections\, respectively\, Daphne Lifts Up and The Bastard & Th
 e Bishop. Our audience will be swept away by musical interludes on various
  stringed instruments from award-winning composer and musician\, Jared Eme
 rson-Johnson. Local watercolor artist and college instructor\, Barbara Mar
 lin\, creator of the Daphne Lifts Up book cover will display the original 
 artwork and selected prints of other work at the event. Following the read
 ings and music\, a Q&A will follow\, with book sales and signing in the lo

 ations always gratefully accepted.    Donna Emerson divides her time betwe

 . Retired from teaching at Santa Rosa Jr. College and her clinical social 
 work practice\, her recent poetry publications include La Pressa\, The Pat
 erson Literary Review\, and Weber: The Contemporary West. Her chapbooks: T
 his Water\, 2007\, Body Rhymes\, 2009\, Wild Mercy\, 2011\, and Following 
 Hay\, 2013. Her poetry books are The Place of Our Meeting \\(Finishing Lin
 e Press\, 2018\\) and Beside the Well \\(Cherry Grove Collections. 2019\\)
 . And now\, Daphne Lifts Up \\(Finishing Line Press\, 2025\\). Donna has r
 eceived two nominations for the Pushcart Prize\, one for "Best of the Net\
 ," two nominations for the California Book Award \\(Body Rhymes\, 2009\, T
 he Place of Our Meeting\, 2018\\)\, five awards from the annual Allen Gins
 berg Contests\, and numerous regional awards for her poetry\, creative non
 -fiction\, and prose. Many of her poems appear in journals or anthologies 
 with her black and white or color photography. Anais Nin used Donna's port
 raits of Anais in her late diaries and press coverage in the New York Time
 s.  Donna has taught poetry to elementary school children and made it part
  of her community college classrooms \\(1990-2015\\). She worked as a volu
 nteer with Alzheimer's patients at a residential facility to help them cre
 ate individual and group poems and served as Board member and Events Chair
  for the Marin Poetry Center \\(2012-2014\\). Donna's latest book\, "Daphn
 e Lifts Up" includes poems about nature around us\, nature within us\, and
  relationships with many different people\, from family to counseling clie
 nts\, to students\, colleagues at work\, animals\, birds\, and strangers. 
 It addresses birth\, illness\, death\, and resiliency in all these verses.
     Gerald Fleming is the author of the poetry collections The Bastard and
  the Bishop \\(Hanging Loose Press\, 2021\\)\, One \\(Hanging Loose\, 2016
 \\)\, The Choreographer \\(Sixteen Rivers Press\, 2013\\)\, Night of Pure 
 Breathing \\(Hanging Loose\, 2011\\)\, and Swimmer Climbing onto Shore \\(
 Sixteen Rivers\, 2005\\). His work has appeared in many magazines over the
  decades\, including New Letters\, Michigan Quarterly Review\, Hanging Loo
 se\, Carolina Quarterly\, New World Writing\, Volt\, Paris Lit Up\, and Ve
 rsal.  Fleming edited the print magazines Barnabe Mountain Review and Forw
 ard to Velma\, the vitreous magazine One \\(More\\) Glass\, and The Collec
 ted Poetry & Prose of Lawrence Fixel \\(Sixteen Rivers\, 2021\\). He has w
 ritten numerous books for teachers\, including Rain\, Steam\, and Speed \\
 (Jossey-Bass/Wiley\, 2005\\)\, and lives most of the year near San Francis
 co\, part of the year in Paris. Fleming\, a master of the prose poem\, is 
 never satisfied to sing the same song\, and this adventuresome spirit pays
  dividends in these new prose poems. Constantly surprising and inventive\,
   The Bastard and the Bishop offers stories within stories that effortless
 ly merge the personal and the archetypal\, breathing new life into a genre
  that has increasingly\, and often sadly\, become predictable.     Jared E

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books and Read On Sonoma are honored
  to welcome literacy advocate and motivational speaker Oliver James for th
 e launch of his powerful new memoir - Unread: A Memoir of Learning \\(and 
 Loving\\) to Read on TikTok! Oliver will be joined in conversation by belo
 ved friend and local librarian\, Mychal Threets. Join us for an unforgetta
 ble evening of literary insight followed by an audience Q&A and book signi
 ng with photo opportunities. All event proceeds will be donated to local n
 on-profit and vital literacy initiative\,  Read On Sonoma . This is a free
  event\, registration required due to limited seating. Honest and thought-
 provoking\, Unread is an inspiring\, hopeful memoir of growth and change -
  Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational n
 eglect\, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approxi
 mately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However\, at age 32\,
  with big dreams and few tools to actualize them\, he dedicated himself to
  learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliv
 er has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documen
 ted his decision to learn to read as an adult\, and his struggles and triu
 mphs along the way. Here\, he tells the full story behind his journey for 
 the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his exper
 ience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us ho
 w to be better\, more empathetic people. In just 365 days\, Oliver went fr
 om barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal o
 f finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us 
 that words and stories have power\, and that\, no matter our past\, it's n
 ever too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal
  trainer\, motivational speaker\, literacy activist\, and influencer. He h
 as been featured in or on Today\, NPR\, Jennifer Hudson Show\, Los Angeles
  Times\, Newsweek\, Rachael Ray\, and ABC News\, among many others. Additi
 onally\, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Lite
 racy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa\, California. Mychal Threets is a libra
 rian\, literary ambassador\, and the library's number one fan \\(according
  to himself\, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-
 school kid and grew up in Fairfield\, CA\, right between Sacramento and Sa
 n Francisco. Online\, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people th
 at their mental health always matters\, and he encourages everyone to know
  they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself\, Mychal is proud to
  serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/
 26\\) is his first book. His cats\, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barl
 ow\, did not help at all\, but he still appreciates them. Read On Sonoma a
  dedicated group of professionals\, educators and volunteers promoting lit
 eracy within our elementary schools. Donate directly\, meet the Executive 
 team\, and learn more about the tremendous work that they do by joining us
  that evening. For more information\, please visit their  website . Praise
 : "Unread feels like both story and concordance\, a good read and a great 
 resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But 
 mostly\, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in o
 rder to enunciate resilience\, one must learn the phonetics of desire\, su
 rvival\, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel." -Jason Reynolds\, New Yor
 k Times bestselling author of the Track series "An inspiring and deeply hu
 man story about resilience\, courage\, and the transformative power of lit
 eracy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey\, shared with millions onl
 ine\, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He
  not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late
  to learn\, to dream\, and to rewrite your own story." -Andrew Roberts\, P
 resident\, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy "Oliver James is a 
 big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave
 \, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . 
 He's the living\, breathing\, thriving example of what reading can do for 
 a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel\, there a
 re quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he 
 went through-but if their parents\, educators\, and leaders would read thi
 s memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them\, to
 o. This raw\, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has be
 en through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth
 ." -I. C. Robledo\, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By "Unread isn'
 t just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of ou
 r own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to 
 the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver J
 ames is a role model for us all." -Kelley Coleman\, author of Everything N
 o One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child "A thoughtful and inspiri
 ng story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading help
 s to change lives." -Kirkus

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

  musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm\, Joh
 n Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seam
 lessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time m
 usic for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year\, with seven ac
 claimed albums and two Juno nominations\, the Jaybirds are simultaneously 
 innovative and unadorned\, sophisticated and stripped-down\, happily old-f
 ashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance\, $40 at 
 the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelcha
 ir accessible. Art gallery open during intermission\, refreshments for sal
 e.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman "one of the worl
 d's undisputed masters" of the mandolin\, famed for outstanding tone and t
 aste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular fav
 ourites for sessions and covers\, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He 
 has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded o
 n many other projects\, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The 
 Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music wit
 h highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller\; t
 he duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San 
 Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bl
 uegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary "new acoustic" qu
 artet\, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit\, renowned for highly skilled i
 nstrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed
  the Jaybirds. Of their latest album\, Folk Radio UK said "On That Other G
 reen Shore showcases an accomplished\, experienced band at the peak of the
 ir powers\, with musicianship of the very highest order." Peghead Nation c
 alled it "one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017." 
 Los Angeles\, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 201
 7. The veteran performer has played with\, among others\, Doc Watson\, Ric
 hard Greene\, John Jorgensen\, Peter Rowan\, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty.
  He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions
  by Laurie Lewis\, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher
  Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Day
 lighting the Creek as "a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the g
 lory days of early bluegrass guitar." Chilliwack\, BC-based Trisha Gagnon 
 is portrayed by Sing Out! as "one of the most versatile" and "irresistible
 " lead vocalists in bluegrass\, her strong and distinctive style ranging f
 rom "mournful and plaintive" to "hopeful and yearning." Trisha anchors wha
 t Dirty Linen magazine calls "gorgeous three-part harmonies." She's also k
 nown for songwriting\, dating back to her early days with the award-winnin
 g B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gil
 l and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo\, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his ow
 n voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contempo
 rary banjo players. "Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingli
 ng\," said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\)\, was nom
 inated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015\, and Nick is a composer wh
 o also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley S
 tation on the new Jaybird album "showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense 
 of melody\," said Green Man Review. Spokane\, WA-based Greg Spatz is haile
 d as a "world-class bluegrass fiddler" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Aud
 ition says Greg's "virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after ti
 me\," while Bluegrass Unlimited says he "lays down some seriously fine blu
 egrass fiddle" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made 
 him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast\, where he'
 s played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield\, resophonic guitar maste
 r Rob Ickes\, and many others including Laurie Lewis\, Bryan Bowers\, and 
 Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squ
 irrel\, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with h
 is wife called All Along the Sea\, and is an award-winning

DESCRIPTION:Water Tower is the current moniker of multi-instrumentalist Ke
 nny Feinstein’s musical brainchild\, originally founded in 2005 in Portl
 and. While their lineup has evolved over time\, fuelled by Feinstein’s m
 asterful song-crafting\, fiercely DIY approach\, and genre-bending sonic i
 dentity\, Water Tower have established themselves as a global force to be 
 reckoned with.\n\nPioneers of a new wave of bluegrass and old-time with a 
 distinctly punk rock flair\, Water Tower take influences from Foghorn Stri
 ngband and Bill Monroe to Rancid and Black Flag\, passing them through a u
 nique lens that magnifies the individual strength of their core and auxili
 ary members while remaining faithful to the revivalist spirit.\n\nIn 2015\
 , the band moved to LA\, where their current lineup of Kenny Feinstein \\(
 lead vocals\, guitar\, fiddle\, mandolin\\)\, Tommy Drinkard \\(banjo\, vo
 cals\\)\, Taylor Estes \\(Bass\, Vocals\, and Nicholas Leahy \\(mandolin\,
  vocals\\) can often be found busking while not in the studio or on tour.\
 n\nSince then\, Water Tower have built major momentum\, releasing a concep
 t album Fly Around \\(ft. guest vocals from Black Flag’s Ron Reyes and p
 roduced by Don Bolles of The Germs\\)\, filming 1m\\+ view viral videos\, 
 and catching the eye of A-listers including Katy Perry\, whose 2023 NYE pa
 rty they played at\, and Riff Raff\, who shouted out “Take Me Back”\, 
 the debut single from their upcoming album Live from Los Angeles\, to be r
 eleased later this year. A slew of tour dates in the US and the UK has alr
 eady been announced.

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists 
 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next 
 round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers\, 2013's Electric Punishment\,
  and 2016's Concussion Protocol.

 ’re able to glide into calm\, lush stretches of the river that are norma

 f the Petaluma River’s brackish\, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets

  river’s ecology and human history\, offering insight into how this uppe

DESCRIPTION:*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Or
 iginally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows\, this exhibit explores ageis
 m through contemporary art\, featuring works by both local youth and senio
 r artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiat
 ive designed to challenge stereotypes about aging\, address ageism and soc
 ial isolation\, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of
  art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts\, the exhibit features artworks
  by local youth and senior artists\, showcasing how age intersects with cr
 eativity\, identity\, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts\
 , these emerging and established artists work side by side to create colla
 borative pieces\, fostering meaningful connections between generations and
  reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit a
 lso includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubre
 y Hirsch\, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organi
 zed by Stacey Gordon\, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregi
 ving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at
  the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6\, 2026. 
 Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits\, Monday to 
 Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is prese
 nted by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Fou
 ndation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit\, the *What About Age?* 
 initiative offers programming\, led by Vivalon\, designed to challenge age
 ism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.

 ECEPTION: SATURDAY\, MARCH 7\, 2026\, 4-6 pm: Join in to meet the artists 
 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 chelle Lambert brings a world of experience when she steps up to the micro

  attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from 
 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki
 ng music ever since. A pop folk and hip-hop artist whose career has taken 
 her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic 
 music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn
  more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n"Michelle Lambert is the kind of ele
 ctric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Wh
 ether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a c
 onfident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between 
 the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the sta
 ge before wielding her violin in classic rock goddess mode. Michelle Lambe
 rt is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!"\n\n-Den
 nis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a
  melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influenc
 es when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emo
 tional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishe
 s in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:Lila Downs\, one of the most powerful and unique voices in the
  world. \n\n \n\nWinner of a Grammy and 6 Latin Grammys\, Lila Downs trium
 phs on stage for her personality and for the moving stories that are told

DESCRIPTION:with Kate Munding\, Jennifer Berezan\, DaRa Williams and Erin 
 Treat\n\nAcross centuries and continents\, women have deep roots in the Bu
 ddha Dharma. They have been great contributors and carriers of the lineage
  and yet have too often remained hidden beneath the surface of history. Th
 eir stories are fierce\, resilient\, and revolutionary. Do you know them?\
 n\nFrom the first Buddhist nuns who challenged the norms of their time\, t
 o modern-day teachers\, mothers\, activists\, and visionaries reshaping sp
 iritual life today\, women have always been keystones to the continuation 
 of the Dharma. This benefit event invites all genders to step into that le
 gacy—to see\, honor\, and draw strength from the women who have shaped t
 he Dharma with their courage and uncompromising truth.\n\nTogether with an
  inspiring group of contemporary Dharma teachers\, we’ll explore these s
 tories and ask: What guidance do these spiritual ancestors offer us now—
 when clarity\, groundedness\, and collective courage are so urgently neede
 d?

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWh
 y Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute 
 interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stresse
 d out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyo
 nd Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Mad
 e plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something s
 till isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the r
 ight things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\, or creative en
 deavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrated underneath it
  all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But becau
 se there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T
  TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when conf
 idence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up re
 sponsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progres
 s without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) throu
 gh uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of re
 al-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle culture.\n\nEverythi
 ng you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\, adjusted\, and prac
 ticed in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and real life.\n\nWHAT THI
 S WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a pra
 ctical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in plannin
 g and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t com
 e first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How s
 mall\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited t
 o slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what actually matters right 
 now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• 
 Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about w
 hat you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop w
 aiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willing
 ness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\
 n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually
  holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed se
 nse of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next step forward\n\n• A pra
 ctical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretendin
 g.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell i
 s an Inspirational Author\, Teacher\, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Co
 ach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experi
 ence.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery\, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(
 and its companion workbook\\)\, Morning Motivation\, and Chill.\n\nHis wor
 k is grounded\, practical\, and focused on real change — without hype\, 
 dogma\, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TA
 KE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready\, this workshop 
 opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help 
 you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals a
 nd changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. 
 Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Jordana is a pioneering US Drum & Bass DJ\, musician & produce
 r based in Seattle. Recently she  launched her SpeKtra residency at Kremwe
 rk\, became an Imagine Audio artist and joined the Emergence DnB Collectiv
 e. A global performer and trans rights advocate.\n\nIn the 90s\, Jordana e
 stablished herself as one of the early pioneers of U.S. Drum and Bass\, re
 leasing a few albums for the New York-based Jungle Sky label as well as a 
 plethora of singles and remixes. \n\nHer introduction to electronic dance 
 music came in 1988 when she began listening to BBC broadcasts featuring re
 ports on the rise of acid house music. It wasn't until the early '90s that
  dance music crept into Pittsburgh\, and Jordana began frequenting many of
  the city's first rave-like parties and soon began making dance music of h
 er own. \n\nHer first signed work was an atmospheric Drum 'n' Bass remix o
 f Blondie's "Atomic" in 1995 for EMI/Chrysalis. Liquid Sky Music then star
 ted releasing her music in 1996\, beginning with the compilation track "Di
 s Soun'" featured on This Is Jungle Sky\, Vol. 2. The New York label also 
 released a few murderous albums in the subsequent years\, beginning with W
 hen Worlds Collide \\(1997\\) and continuing through Quality Rolls \\(1998
 \\) and The Cities Collection \\(2000\\). The Cities Collection was releas
 ed under the Jordana name\, though her record label ignored her wishes for
  the change and mainly pushed “1.8.7.” She now considers 1.8.7 a deadn
 ame.\n\nAs both a producer and DJ\, Jordana has toured the world as a head
 liner. She has also worked with artists such as Mike Joyce \\(formerly of 
 The Smiths\\)\, Debbie Harry and Blondie\, Lady Sovereign\, MC Kinky from 
 London/ffrr\, Yellownote and TC Izlam from Liquid Sky Records. In England 
 she played Garage as Lady J on Flex FM. \n\nJordana has been featured or a
 ppeared in Resident Advisor\, Spin\, Rolling Stone\, Knowledge \\(UK\\)\, 
 Vibe\, Raygun\, Urb\, Mixmag and Out Magazine and has been listed in Raygu
 n's "Who's Who of International DJs". She also made Out Magazine's OUT100 
 in 1999. 2014 saw her named in Harriet magazine as "12 women in black musi
 c history you should know".  In 2015 Mixmag named her as "20 women who sha
 ped the history of dance music".\n\nIn 2014\, Jordana scored the documenta
 ry Free CeCe produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress/directo
 r Laverne Cox. Jordana has dedicated her career to speaking publicly about
  trans issues and Black Lives and has been featured in several cultural bo
 oks including New York Times bestseller ‘The Rise of the Creative Class
 ’ by Richard Florida\, Michaelangelo Matos’s ‘The Underground is Mas
 sive’ and ‘Rave Culture\, an Insider’s Overview’ by Jimi Fritz and
  Virginia Smallfry. This work is close to home for Jordana as she’s a ha
 te crime survivor herself.\n\nInspired by the Black Lives Matter movement 
 in 2020\, Jordana returned with the politically-charged single ‘Fight Fo
 r Our Lives’ \\(work-in-progress\\) and a handful of newer productions\,
  teasing a full-album release. She also released ‘The Uprising’ DJ mix
  to Mixcloud and DJ’ed part of Kremwerk’s online Pride celebrations as
  well as on Seattle\, London and LA radio. In addition she performed at Se
 attle’s “Drum and Bass Tuesdays” Livestream as her debut appearance 
 which is the longest running D&B weekly event in the world. \n\n2021 saw h
 er be invited by the prolific festival and brand Dekmantel to contribute t
 o their podcast series and headlined on a lineup with Arca for Currents.fm
  as a part of Un/Tuck and Hot Mass. Additionally she appeared on EQ50 Blac
 k Herstory stream which\, supported by DJ Flight from the UK and DaFunkNYC
  made the debut appearance for the lineup online. Jordana was a writer and
  producer on the song “The Future” on Alpha Pup Records/Producer Dojo 
 with Mimi Page and iLL.Gates August of 2021. An animated music video was a
 lso published to Youtube. 2022 saw Jordana return to performing with an ar
 senal of new tracks as she makes her official in person return at Kremfest
  2022. Throughout 2023 Jordana played several events and underground raves
 .\n\nIn 2024 Jordana launched SpeKtra\, her residency at Kremwerk\, the op
 ening night featured Flava D and the night brought in DJs such as Mizeyesi
 s and a special Pride Month edition brought over B-Complex. Jordana and B-
 Complex also collaborated on a track featuring Zak Meow called Lorem Ipsum
 . She also joined the Emergence DnB Collective.

DESCRIPTION:with Carol Cano\, MA and Ayya Santacitta\n\nIn a world of cons
 tant change and uncertainty\, this half-day of mindfulness practice offers
  an invitation to return to what is steady and reliable. Drawing from Fore
 st Buddhist teachings and earth-based awareness\, we will cultivate a peac
 e that does not depend on conditions. A peace that arises from being fully
  present\, embodied\, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditat
 ion\, and periods of silence\, we will explore the body as part of the liv
 ing earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than 
 striving for calm\, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds 
 us—moment by moment\, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to 
 slow down\, listen deeply\, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace withi
 n our own hearts.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s

  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 e County Historical Society\, a limited edition Sprecher beer-BoDeans Orig
 inal Ginger Brew\, and numerous shows\, including a much anticipated retur
 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton
  Kutcher\, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent i
 nstallation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part

  are transferred from Damacus\, Syria\, to Jerusalem\, Jordan in late 1955
 . I came to know and love my Bedouin neighbors. They kindly lend me their 
 only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in th
 e Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beauti
 ful\, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and 
 generous neighbors. Ten years ago\, I picked up volume number one of "The 
 Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night" translated by Sir Richard Franc
 is Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her
  emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of eve
 ry young\, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volume

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University

 and celebrate the show. Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing 
 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

 fully crafted brooms that’ll make your everyday cleanup feel like an upg
 rade. Whether you’re drawn to classic corn brooms\, sleek hearth sweeper
 s\, or want to design something that’s never been seen before- there’s
  a spot at the workbench with your name on it.\n\nNo prior experience need
 ed! Our crew of makers ranges from first-time crafters to seasoned hands\,
  all sharing the same mission: creating functional art that’s too pretty
  to hide in the closet and that’ll make sweeping feel like showing off.

DESCRIPTION:Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of leg
 acy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group\, meeting
  to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous\, or not-so-famous\\) poets o
 f the past & present who have left a mark on literature\, the art of poetr
 y\, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male\
 , female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & e
 rotic\, political\, pastoral & personal\, dreamers\, ragers\, firebrands\,
  sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize\, 
 and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interest
 ed poets & potential participants\, the library will publish this growing 
 list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review\, with
  a short bio & picture\, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poet
 s listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from part
 icipants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wed
 nesday of each month\, we will gather for a round-table review of several 
 poets\, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to expl
 ore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meet
 ing to read about their chosen poet\, explore one or more biographies & se
 veral poems\, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gather
 ing. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems
 \, then we will open a discussion among the participants\, after which tha
 t participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant w
 ill then read a chosen poem\, followed by a discussion\, as well as his or
  her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants
  have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present\, eac
 h segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list 
 at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei 
 Codrescu Anna Akmatova Cesar Vallejo Dylan Thomas E.E. Cummings Elizabeth

 for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**
 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
