  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta
 edtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip
  and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Membershi
 ps and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase 
 over $40. Materials fees are not discounted.\n\nBecome a member today and 
 find community\, connection\, and creativity.

SUMMARY:God of our Heart\, God of our Realization
DESCRIPTION:Rosicrucians AMORC\, Santa Rosa\, CA\nA focal point of the Ros
 icrucian teachings is mysticism\, the conscious union of the self with the
  Divine or God. The centrality of mysticism to our Order is reflected in t
 he very name of our Order\, Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis. An evolvi
 ng personal conception and realization of the Divine is part of the spirit
 ual journey of Rosicrucian students\, reflected in the Rosicrucian invocat
 ion\, “God of our Heart\, God or our Realization.” During this telecon
 ference\, Julian Johnson will lead us in exploring the dominant conception
 s of the Divine which are presented in the earliest monographs of the Rosi
 crucian studies\, in addition to the Rosicrucian conception of the Divine 
 or Absolute. We will also look at how modern neuroscience surprisingly rev
 eals connections between our conceptions of God and our body and mind.\n\n

 st.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists\, **Linda Ba
 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ent plastic dolls \\(Barbies\, Kens\, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\
 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo
 gy Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every

 :\n\nChef Carlos was born in El Salvador\, where his passion for cooking b
 egan in the kitchen with his grandmother and mother\, creating simple yet 
 flavorful family meals. After his family migrated to the United States\, C
 arlos worked at his uncle’s restaurant in Sebastopol\, further deepening
  his love for food. While attending Piner High School\, in Santa Rosa\, he
  joined a newly established culinary program\, where he learned profession
 al kitchen skills and participated in local food competitions with renowne
 d chefs like Guy Fieri and Rich Nolan. In 2008\, his high school team won 
 first place in the Santa Rosa Iron Chef competition. During this time\, Ca
 rlos also took on the responsibility of cooking family meals\, solidifying
  his dream of becoming a chef. \n\nAfter graduating\, Carlos started at J
 ackson’s in Santa Rosa as a dishwasher but quickly worked his way up thr
 ough various kitchen roles\, impressing his colleagues with his dedication
  and skill. His hard work caught the attention of two restaurateurs\, who 
 offered him a sous chef position at their new restaurant. While thriving i
 n this role\, Carlos realized his passion for showcasing Latin cuisine and
  decided to pursue further education. He earned an associate degree from S
 anta Rosa Junior College’s culinary program and took additional courses 
 at the Culinary Institute of America \\(CIA\\) Greystone\, St. Helena focu
 sing on pastry and butchery. Next up\, Chef Carlos was the head of food de
 velopment at La Tortilla Factory in Santa Rosa\, creating new recipes and 
 products. \n\nAt 24\, Carlos saved $60\,000 from playing in a popular\, a
 ward winning family band and flipping a house with his father. In 2014\, h
 e found a small restaurant space in Healdsburg and\, with his father as a 
 partner\, opened Guiso Latin Fusion on October 15\, 2015. Drawing inspirat
 ion from Central and South America\, Carlos built the restaurant’s reput
 ation organically\, eventually gaining recognition from a San Francisco Ch
 ronicle food writer\, which propelled his success.\n\nFor Carlos\, food is
  art\, and every dish tells a story rooted in his culture and childhood. H
 e strives to create a family-like atmosphere in his restaurant\, where gue
 sts feel connected and leave with memorable experiences. Beyond running hi
 s restaurant\, Carlos mentors young chefs\, develops a rosé wine brand ca
 lled BELI’S\, and continues to “Live a Flavorful Life.” His motto\, 
 “Cook My Culture\,” reflects his deep connection to his roots and his 
 passion for creating meaningful culinary experiences.\n\nAWARDS\n\n\\+Best

DESCRIPTION:Profs and Pints Napa presents: “The \\(New\\) Science of A
 ttraction\,” on psychological research that’s upending assumptions ab
 out how we pick partners\, with Paul W. Eastwick\, professor of psychology
  at the University of California Davis and author of Bonded by Evolution:
  The New Science of Love and Connection.\n\nOver the past few decades\, a 
 buzzy new branch of science\, evolutionary psychology\, has spread a deepl
 y flawed story about romantic relationships. Cloaking itself in the langua
 ge of incontrovertible Darwinian fact\, it has popularized the idea that o
 ur minds have been shaped by primal drives that pit the genders against ea
 ch other. It has promoted the myth that men are wired to be promiscuous an
 d the notions that wealth\, status\, and beauty are the ultimate aphrodisi
 acs.\n\nIt’s time to say goodbye to such thinking and embrace a more-evo
 lved view of romance\, argues Paul W. Eastwick\, who co-hosts the Love Fa
 ctually podcast and operates a UC-Davis research lab that studies attracti
 on and relationships.\n\nCome to Napa Yards for a talk by Dr. Eastwick tha
 t will give you a much more sophisticated understanding of matters of the 
 heart. \n\nDrawing from pathbreaking research—including original experi
 ments from his own lab—he’ll offer the take that relationship success 
 hinges on compatibility rather than finding someone who meets some univers
 al ideal of a good partner.\n\nHe’ll show that while popularity factors 
 into first impressions\, its influence fades fast. When evaluating mutual 
 friends and acquaintances they’ve known for months\, single people barel
 y agree in their ratings of who is or isn’t desirable as a dating partne
 r.\n\nAlthough men and women occasionally say they want different things o
 ut of romance\, gender differences evaporate once we assess what men and w
 omen actually want. Attraction from ancestral times through the present is
  best depicted as a process of finding—and\, often\, creating—a compat
 ible relationship.\n\nDr. Eastwick will show how the traits we often look 
 for in a partner—personality\, lifestyle\, values\, and humor—are poor
  predictors of compatibility. Instead\, lasting attraction is built throug
 h the gradual forging of strong attachment bonds\, through mundane moments
  in which people offer each other a “safe haven” and “secure base.
 ”\n\nDistilling evolutionary biology\, anthropology\, and psychology int
 o accessible insights\, he’ll explain why we so often choose dating stra
 tegies that make us miserable and how we can use a more evolved approach. 
 \\(Tickets available only online. Advance tickets: $13.50 plus processing 
 fees. Doors: $17\, or $15 with a student ID. Doors open at 5:30 and the ta
 lk begins at 6:30.\\)\n\nImage: “Love Match\,” by Jan van Beers \\(Wik

 OP 10 BOOK OF THE YEAR | A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2024 “A laugh-
 out-loud cultural comedy… This is the New Great American Novel\, and Dan
 zy Senna has set the standard.” –LA Times “Funny\, foxy and fleet…
 The jokes are good\, the punches land\, the dialogue is tart.” – Dwigh
 t Garner\, The New York Times A brilliant take on love and ambition\, fail
 ure and reinvention\, and the racial-identity-industrial complex from the 
 bestselling author of Caucasia. Jane has high hopes that her life is about
  to turn around. After a long\, precarious stretch bouncing among sketchy 
 rentals and sublets\, she and her family are living in luxury for a year\,
  house-sitting in the hills above Los Angeles. The gig magically coincides
  with Jane’s sabbatical\, giving her the time and space she needs to fin
 ish her second novel—a centuries-spanning epic her artist husband\, Lenn
 y\, dubs her “mulatto War and Peace.” Finally\, some semblance of stab
 ility and success seems to be within her grasp. But things don’t work ou
 t quite as hoped. Desperate for a plan B\, like countless writers before h
 er Jane turns her gaze to Hollywood. When she finagles a meeting with Hamp
 ton Ford\, a hot producer with a major development deal at a streaming net
 work\, he seems excited to work with a “real writer\,” and together th
 ey begin to develop “the Jackie Robinson of biracial comedies.” Things
  finally seem to be going right for Jane—until they go terribly wrong. F
 unny\, piercing\, and page turning\, Colored Television is Senna’s most 
 on-the-pulse\, ambitious\, and rewarding novel yet. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Danzy
  Senna is the author of four previous works of fiction\, including the bes
 tselling Caucasia and\, most recently\, New People\, as well as a memoir. 
 The recipient of numerous awards and honors\, she teaches writing at the U
 niversity of Southern California.

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

 l . . . Charming\, smart\, heart-blistering\, and heart-healing.” —Dan
 ez Smith\, The New York Times Book Review “We all need—we all deserve
 —this vibrant\, love-affirming novel that bounds over any difference tha
 t claims to separate us.” —Ron Charles\, The Washington Post In 1972\,
  when workers in Pottstown\, Pennsylvania\, were digging the foundations f
 or a new development\, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton
  at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were t
 wo of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill\, the di
 lapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived si
 de by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe 
 and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona r
 an the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a dea
 f boy to institutionalize him\, it was Chona and Nate Timblin\, the Black 
 janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black commun
 ity on Chicken Hill\, who worked together to keep the boy safe. As these c
 haracters’ stories overlap and deepen\, it becomes clear how much the pe
 ople who live on the margins of white\, Christian America struggle and wha
 t they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what h
 appened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment play
 ed in it\, McBride shows us that even in dark times\, it is love and commu
 nity—heaven and earth—that sustain us. Books are available in the shop

DESCRIPTION:Mama’s Broke is a powerful folk duo that deliver a compellin
 g performance with heart and raw energy. Although highly influenced by the
 ir Canadian roots\, Lisa and Amy are based out of nowhere and everywhere. 
 \n\nTheir two strong voices blend to create haunting harmonies\, while the
 y artfully juggle fiddle\, banjo\, guitar and mandolin\, and incorporate t
 raditional dance and foot percussion into their performance. Their origina
 l – and often dark – compositions push the boundaries of tradition and
  the constraints of genre. Drawing from old-time\, Quebecois\, blues\, pun
 k\, Celtic\, Balkan and  doom metal\, they create a soundscape that is bot
 h familiar and new. \n\nSince forming the band in 2014\, Mama’s Broke ha
 s been gaining momentum fast \; having already completed two European\, an
 d several Canadian and U.S. tours. They have performed in a wide range of 
 venues\, from circus shows in New Orleans\, to pirate ships in Amsterdam\,
  to concert halls in Ireland\, to theatres in Brooklyn. In this way\, they
  stay true to the transient nature of folklore\, as they travel the world 
 sharing and collecting song.

SUMMARY:David Luning at Cloverdale Arts Alliance
DESCRIPTION:AMERICANA NIGHT WITH DAVID LUNING \nDavid Luning returns to Americana Night at the Cloverdale Arts Alliance Gallery on February 19 & 20. \nA Sonoma County staple with a voice that carries both grit and restraint\, Luning writes songs in the lineage of John Prine and Townes Van Zandt — plainspoken on the surface\, quietly devastating underneath. His catalog moves easily between folk\, blues\, and country\, driven by sharp guitar work and a delivery that never overreaches. It’s why his sets feel as convincing in an intimate gallery as they do on festival stages like Hardly Strictly Bluegrass\, and why Luning isn’t just any performer — he’s part of the soundtrack of Cloverdale.

SUMMARY:The Sam Chase & Willy Tea Taylor at Hopmonk Sebastopol
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT: \nTHE SAM CHASE: \nThe Sam Chase is a natural storyteller with a voice that sounds as if it has weathered many an epic tale. With boot stomping orchestration and lyrics that have been immortalized on the tattooed skin of their fans\, The Sam Chase & his band\, The Untraditional\, don’t mess around. \nWILLY TEA TAYLOR: \nThere is no question that Willy Tea Taylor’s life as a singer/songwriter was predetermined – his role realized the moment he wrote his first song. His inspirations drawn from two separate wells; Living the life of a cattleman’s kid and experiencing true visionaries music like Greg Brown\, John Hartford\, and Guy Clark. The image of Guy Clark and friends sitting around the kitchen table loaded with ashtrays full of butts\, half-smoked cigarettes\, food\, and booze on one Christmas Eve in 1975 burned into Taylors’s soul. Those guys\, swapping songs without pretense\, lit Willy Tea’s fire. And ever since\, its led purpose with passion – finding a hang by curating relationships through musical friendships that get him closer to his own Clark style kitchen table. \nFrom his early days co-fronting The Good Luck Thrift Store Outfit\, to singing solo in countless cowboy bars\, to pitching countless wiffle ball games\, Willy Tea has never lost the vision. Now Willy Tea Taylor has taken his vision of the “hero hang” on the road. and his talented traveling band The Fellership is made up of his fantastically talented buds who play Willy’s songs with a brand of reckless abandon and utter humility that spits in the face of pretense. The way The Fellership plays Will’s songs is the way they demand to be played and\, in their short time together\, they have been awe-ing every audience lucky enough to see them.

 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S
 treet\, Healdsburg\, CA 95448. (707) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 becomes the doorway to ultimate fulfillment.\n\nAlthough the heart seeks f

 the deepest fulfillment possible.\n\nThis half-day program is based on the

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 2026\; 1pm-3:30pm$35 Write your way into a productive and rewarding relati
 onship with revision!Session Focus: Whole-body Characters We’ll explore 
 ways to create vivid people on the page and strengthen other elements thro
 ugh character\, including point of view\, sense of place\, and emotional r
 esonance.Revision is to a first draft what marriage is to falling head-ove
 r heels. It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Re
 vision takes time\, skill\, caring\, and fortitude. It asks that we be gen
 erous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge
  what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not fo
 r the faint of heart\, but for writers committed to their relationship wit
 h creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows write
 rs to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll sha
 re a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling\,” which incorporates 
 my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction\, memoir\, and nonfic
 tion. The session includes a craft presentation\, group discussion\, and w
 riting time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful re
 vision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for 
 your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revisio
 n• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind
 • Fiction or nonfiction free write\, early draft\, or manuscript in prog
 ress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and 
 revision challenges to discuss\, particularly as relate to the session foc
 usThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each t
 ime. Check the schedule\, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About 
 the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist\, author\, and strateg
 ic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Danc
 ing at the Bluebird\,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating t
 he Creative Life\,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Mus
 ical Theater\,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolutio
 n: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and\, fo
 r publication in 2027\, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide 
 to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries
  and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Li
 terature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Int
 erdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program
  promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired he
 r to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling\, Nine
  Ways to Mastery\, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their wri
 ting practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing
  books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career\, she’s found that 
 resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resil
 ience to teaching revision as a writing skill\, as well as a practice. \n\

DESCRIPTION:with Amana Brembry Johnson\n\nThere is a knowing that lives be
 neath thought\, an ancient intelligence woven into the fabric of our being
 . The Buddha taught that everything needed for liberating the heart is alr
 eady here\, within this body. The path is not about becoming different\, b
 ut remembering all that has been obscured by the habits of conditioning an
 d forgetfulness.\n\nBy returning to the body as a living archive that has 
 never stopped guiding us\, we reconnect with the sacred inheritance of who
 leness—a continuity passed down through the Buddhadharma and the unbroke
 n line of ancestors whose memories flow within us. This daylong will inclu

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 rretta\, Nancy Gray\, Bev Haley\, Phyllis Rapp\, Donna Schaffer\, Tosya Sh
 ore\, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love\,** painti
 ngs that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red t
 akes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of comple
 mentary violets\, blues\, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” 
 an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper b
 rings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  frui
 t rendered so realistically\, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley\,
  Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral
  displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod 
 to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his he
 ad as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp
 ’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.” 
  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek fig
 ure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days 
 and flowers in the fields\, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette 
 is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition\,” noted Gra
 y.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dan
 ce!\,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part 
 of cultures throughout the world\, dance expression takes on styles that c
 an be structured\, such as ballet\, or\, by contrast\, free flowing.  And
  dance is a beloved part of the dating scene\, whether slow-dancing or roc
 king out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the c
 ouple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up
  in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to
  get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on F
 ebruary 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery\, 306 Center S

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions

 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Railroad historian and former Northwestern Pacific and Souther
 n Pacific officer Fred Codoni will discuss the history of the railroad in 
 Sonoma County\, from the early horse-drawn streetcars – ‘horse car lin

 ) that went through Sebastopol. The current West County Museum in downtown
  Sebastopol was the terminal.  Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14\,000
  railroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set 
 of artifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transp
 ortation\, manufacturing\, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad 
 industry since 1956\, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pa
 cific Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum\, Fred often ran
  P&SR passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junc
 tion\, the only remaining operating car from that railroad.\n\nThis talk i
 s a project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society. It will be 
 preceded by a short update by the society board about what is happening at
  the Historical Society.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 picked up his camera again and began making art.  Phil’s preference is 
 nature/landscape\, but he is drawn to shapes\, lines\, and shadows found i
 n urban landscapes. “My favorite subjects are old rusted cars\, trains\,
  abandoned buildings\, and brightly colored doors.  I use several plugins
  in Photoshop to create surreal images from otherwise ordinary photos.  I
  create photos in both color and black and white\, depending on subject ma
 tter and mood.”\n\nPhil is President of the Napa Valley Photographic Soc
 iety\, and a member of the Fairfield Suisun Valley Art Association\, the V
 acaville Art League\, Gold Rush Photo Club\, and the Lightwriters Photogra

 rica\, and the Photographic Society of America.\n\nPhil’s work has been

 pany\, including shows at the Vacaville Art Gallery\, the Napa Public Libr
 ary\, Solano Town Center Gallery\, the Gallery at Village 360\, and he is 
 a resident artist at The Little Shop in Benicia.  He has won several awar
 ds at local shows and contests\, including a Juror's Choice Award at the 2

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ur fears. We may have to dig deeper for hope these days\, but we know wher
 e to find it. In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how "Be not afr
 aid" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation\, and ho
 w even in the midst of troubles\, both public and personal\, we can help e
 ach other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both o
 ur own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will 
 focus on experiences of fear\, courage\, consolation\, and resilience in t
 he historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nM

 iters and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley\, Western Theologica

 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play

 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo

 n of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale
  sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally\, her piece "Brave Little
  Hunter" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island\, highlighting

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:Bluegrass\, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding
  musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm\, Joh
 n Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seam
 lessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time m
 usic for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year\, with seven ac
 claimed albums and two Juno nominations\, the Jaybirds are simultaneously 
 innovative and unadorned\, sophisticated and stripped-down\, happily old-f
 ashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance\, $40 at 
 the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelcha
 ir accessible. Art gallery open during intermission\, refreshments for sal
 e.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman "one of the worl
 d's undisputed masters" of the mandolin\, famed for outstanding tone and t
 aste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular fav
 ourites for sessions and covers\, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He 
 has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded o
 n many other projects\, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The 
 Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music wit
 h highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller\; t
 he duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San 
 Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bl
 uegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary "new acoustic" qu
 artet\, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit\, renowned for highly skilled i
 nstrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed
  the Jaybirds. Of their latest album\, Folk Radio UK said "On That Other G
 reen Shore showcases an accomplished\, experienced band at the peak of the
 ir powers\, with musicianship of the very highest order." Peghead Nation c
 alled it "one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017." 
 Los Angeles\, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 201
 7. The veteran performer has played with\, among others\, Doc Watson\, Ric
 hard Greene\, John Jorgensen\, Peter Rowan\, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty.
  He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions
  by Laurie Lewis\, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher
  Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Day
 lighting the Creek as "a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the g
 lory days of early bluegrass guitar." Chilliwack\, BC-based Trisha Gagnon 
 is portrayed by Sing Out! as "one of the most versatile" and "irresistible
 " lead vocalists in bluegrass\, her strong and distinctive style ranging f
 rom "mournful and plaintive" to "hopeful and yearning." Trisha anchors wha
 t Dirty Linen magazine calls "gorgeous three-part harmonies." She's also k
 nown for songwriting\, dating back to her early days with the award-winnin
 g B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gil
 l and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo\, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his ow
 n voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contempo
 rary banjo players. "Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingli
 ng\," said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\)\, was nom
 inated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015\, and Nick is a composer wh
 o also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley S
 tation on the new Jaybird album "showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense 
 of melody\," said Green Man Review. Spokane\, WA-based Greg Spatz is haile
 d as a "world-class bluegrass fiddler" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Aud
 ition says Greg's "virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after ti
 me\," while Bluegrass Unlimited says he "lays down some seriously fine blu
 egrass fiddle" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made 
 him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast\, where he'
 s played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield\, resophonic guitar maste
 r Rob Ickes\, and many others including Laurie Lewis\, Bryan Bowers\, and 
 Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squ
 irrel\, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with h

DESCRIPTION:We said we were a community hub\, right? We said we bring Heal
 dsburg to life? Well… it’s time to put our money where our mouth is. A
 nd we’re doing it right! We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand
 -up comedy nights with one of the best standup comedians in town (in our o
 pinion\, in other people’s opinions\, and soon\, in your opinion too): S
 teve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night
  in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Eithe
 r way\, Steve is back. He’s our main man\, living-room ringmaster\, and 
 the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an 
 MC for friends’ bands\, which eventually led to his first stand-up set -
  a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants P
 ass\, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead\, he embr
 aced the stage as a place for brutally honest\, painfully awkward life con
 fessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy\, or very\, very funny co
 medy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup 
 - a proud Midwesterner now living in California\, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist
  in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite
  at The Punchline San Francisco\, Cobb’s\, San Jose Improv\, Rooster T. 
 Feathers\, and Don’t Tell Comedy\, and performs regularly at clubs and f
 estivals across California and beyond. If sharp\, witty\, and hilarious is
  your vibe\, Jalisa’s got you covered.\n\nAnd then there’s Ronn Vigh -
  our headliner. Ronn has written for *Fashion Police* on E! Television and
  performs stand-up at clubs\, colleges\, and venues across the country. He
  still dreams of becoming a weatherman (we support the dream). In the mean
 time\, he’s an avid yogi (when not hungover)\, a devoted *Golden Girls* 
 fan\, and - despite being gay - a lifelong football lover.

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*\, is a hea
 rtfelt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\,
  in the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can 
 profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where
  we often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to 
 consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to refl
 ect on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beau
 ty of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the fr
 agility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong e
 xploration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided med
 itations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will s
 upport one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life an
 d vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must
  know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Mon
 thly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions requi
 red\; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (r
 equired!)**: Monthly (12)\, 1-hour\, self-facilitated\, self-hosted Home G
 roups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational a
 spect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group wil
 l determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for e
 veryone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guid
 ed meditations\, readings\, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + mont
 hly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recordi
 ng access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n
 \n**Q&As**: Monthly\, 1-hour\, recorded (optional)

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

SUMMARY:Naturally Arising Samādhi and Insight

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s
 trength\, and creative expression. Anchored by a collaborative\, life-size
  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next 
 round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers\, 2013's Electric Punishment\,
  and 2016's Concussion Protocol.

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos
 ting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gal

 +In this one day introductory workshop\, participants will get a peek into
  the process of building one’s drawing abilities through developing clos
 e observational skills and learning fundamental drawing techniques. If you
  find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring\, you can sign up for 
 the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to pr
 actice and advance their drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t 
 practiced in years\, or any artists who just want to learn more and practi
 ce with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learni
 ng to see - a skill that anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Throu
 gh demonstration\, practice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will 
 explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure 
 environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of pract
 ical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of wha
 t one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if y
 ou feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply w
 ant to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the clas
 s for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts
  with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\
 , then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printm
 aking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected\,
  but her personal practice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, waterc
 olor\, mixed media\, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats
  (kids\, teens\, adults\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and man
 y mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but
  also enjoys teaching drawing\, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta
 edtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip
  and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Membershi
 ps and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase 
 over $40. Materials fees are not discounted.\n\nBecome a member today and 
 find community\, connection\, and creativity.

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot

SUMMARY: Oil Portrait in Four Steps with Maggie Parr
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th
 -March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (f
 irst 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggi
 e)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks\, 
 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

 hoed across many cultures\, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and 
 all who have passed\, those in transition\, and those in distress.This ong
 oing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war\, with a specia
 l focus now on the approximately 19\,000 children who have perished in Isr
 ael and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple\, meditative act of worki
 ng with clay\, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public
  exhibits and peace sites\, offering spaces for reflection\, mourning\, an
 d hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of
  these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each mo
 nth at SebArts\, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to 
 ages 12 - adult\, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and
  basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.The
 re is no fee for this class\; donations are welcome to help cover material

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki

 the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the sta

DESCRIPTION:FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWh
 y Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute 
 interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stresse
 d out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyo
 nd Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Mad
 e plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something s
 till isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the r
 ight things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\, or creative en
 deavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrated underneath it
  all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But becau
 se there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T
  TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when conf
 idence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up re
 sponsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progres
 s without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) throu
 gh uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of re
 al-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle culture.\n\nEverythi
 ng you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\, adjusted\, and prac
 ticed in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and real life.\n\nWHAT THI
 S WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a pra
 ctical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in plannin
 g and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t com
 e first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How s
 mall\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited t
 o slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what actually matters right 
 now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• 
 Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about w
 hat you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop w
 aiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willing
 ness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\
 n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually
  holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed se
 nse of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next step forward\n\n• A pra
 ctical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretendin
 g.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell i
 s an Inspirational Author\, Teacher\, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Co
 ach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experi
 ence.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery\, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(
 and its companion workbook\\)\, Morning Motivation\, and Chill.\n\nHis wor
 k is grounded\, practical\, and focused on real change — without hype\, 
 dogma\, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TA
 KE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready\, this workshop 
 opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help 
 you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals a
 nd changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. 
 Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.

DESCRIPTION:with Kate Munding\, Jennifer Berezan\, DaRa Williams and Erin 
 Treat\n\nAcross centuries and continents\, women have deep roots in the Bu

  and yet have too often remained hidden beneath the surface of history. Th
 eir stories are fierce\, resilient\, and revolutionary. Do you know them?\
 n\nFrom the first Buddhist nuns who challenged the norms of their time\, t
 o modern-day teachers\, mothers\, activists\, and visionaries reshaping sp
 iritual life today\, women have always been keystones to the continuation 
 of the Dharma. This benefit event invites all genders to step into that le
 gacy—to see\, honor\, and draw strength from the women who have shaped t
 he Dharma with their courage and uncompromising truth.\n\nTogether with an
  inspiring group of contemporary Dharma teachers\, we’ll explore these s
 tories and ask: What guidance do these spiritual ancestors offer us now—
 when clarity\, groundedness\, and collective courage are so urgently neede

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

SUMMARY:Monoprints: Drawing & Printing Abstraction Two-day workshop

DTEND;TZID=PST;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260307T160000

DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:with Carol Cano\, MA and Ayya Santacitta\n\nIn a world of cons
 tant change and uncertainty\, this half-day of mindfulness practice offers
  an invitation to return to what is steady and reliable. Drawing from Fore
 st Buddhist teachings and earth-based awareness\, we will cultivate a peac
 e that does not depend on conditions. A peace that arises from being fully
  present\, embodied\, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditat
 ion\, and periods of silence\, we will explore the body as part of the liv
 ing earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than 
 striving for calm\, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds 
 us—moment by moment\, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to 
 slow down\, listen deeply\, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace withi
 n our own hearts.

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

SUMMARY:Monoprints: Drawing & Printing Abstraction Two-day workshop
DTSTART;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260308T110000
DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260308T160000
UID:260113ypAZmoYJa0OzGS5q2UIXGw
DESCRIPTION:**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typica
 lly painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historica
 lly\, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc t
 o acrylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printi
 ng processes\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is po
 ssible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:In Her Power\n\nA Collaboration by Priscila Soares & JeanCheri
 e\n\nIn Her Power is a group exhibition celebrating women’s presence\, s

  sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie\, the exhibition brings
  together works by women artists exploring power as something lived\, embo
 died\, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mounta
 in lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working toget
 her\, each bringing her own voice\, materials\, and vision. Surrounding th
 is central work\, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own
  relationship to power\, resilience\, intuition\, and selfhood.\n\nRather 
 than offering a single definition\, In Her Power invites viewers to witnes
 s many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce\, ancestral and contem
 porary\, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists 
 and an invitation to step into presence\, creativity\, and connection.\n\n

  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton
  Kutcher\, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent i
 nstallation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

 ease consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” 
 offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffer
 ing we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can b
 e a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in 
 our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You 
 do not have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings 
 to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine
 " sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 year
 s. Her work has created an international community of people who\, by list
 ening to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and los
 s\, helped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on 
 our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a medit
 ation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditat
 e is to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wande
 rs. In poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart
  and along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. Wh
 en we witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness
 \, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a
  strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta

DESCRIPTION:Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of leg
 acy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group\, meeting
  to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous\, or not-so-famous\\) poets o
 f the past & present who have left a mark on literature\, the art of poetr
 y\, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male\
 , female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & e
 rotic\, political\, pastoral & personal\, dreamers\, ragers\, firebrands\,
  sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize\, 
 and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interest
 ed poets & potential participants\, the library will publish this growing 
 list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review\, with
  a short bio & picture\, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poet
 s listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from part
 icipants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wed
 nesday of each month\, we will gather for a round-table review of several 
 poets\, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to expl
 ore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meet
 ing to read about their chosen poet\, explore one or more biographies & se
 veral poems\, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gather
 ing. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems
 \, then we will open a discussion among the participants\, after which tha
 t participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant w
 ill then read a chosen poem\, followed by a discussion\, as well as his or
  her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants
  have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present\, eac
 h segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list 
 at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei 
 Codrescu Anna Akmatova Cesar Vallejo Dylan Thomas E.E. Cummings Elizabeth

  hand-building techniques at an intermediate to advanced level and delve d
 eeper into refining their clay skills. Each session will start with a demo
 nstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative 
 pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces t
 hat might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are
  freeform coil pots\, soft slab work\, hard slab technique\, a variety of 
 sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping\, carving and te
 xtural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips a

 Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After h
 is college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola 
 Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick\, he r
 an a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Tu
 rkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-1
 2 art\, including Ceramics\, Drawing\, Photography\, Design and Sculpture 
 at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High S
 chool and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of the
 se schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teach
 ers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the exper
 imental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help s
 tudents explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for
  the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 ) often destined for landfills\, where they can take 20 to 500 years to de
 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 
 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are tra
 nsformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together\, we’l
 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o
 f-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New t
 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th
 e auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part o
 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo

 students will paint a portrait in the indirect style\, starting with a gr
 ey value study\, building up with layers\, and finishing with powerful de
 tails. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic 
 rules\, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstr
 act\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil
  painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic crea
 tive voice. As Maggie says\, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rule
 s.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints th
 at didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L.\, where she learned that the 
 behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal 
 paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imaginee
 ring\, where for the next three decades\, she designed theme park attract
 ions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration\, murals\
 , portraits\,\ncomics\, and eventually\, writing books and scripts for te
 levision. Along the way\, she studied with master teachers like Steve Hus
 ton\, Jeremy Lipking\, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimentin
 g to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. S
 he got an MFA and taught at the college level\, then developed her own te
 aching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday\, Maggie maintains a
  thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations\, ind
 ividuals\, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classica
 l rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the ser
 vice of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper au
 thenticity\, healing\, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:**with Pawan Bareja\, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment wi
 th our deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is
  personal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the we
 ight of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse
 \, anger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are
  invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns throug
 h embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticin
 g where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied hea
 rt-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner
  clarity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe 
 what has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measura
 ble\, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many exp
 erience deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to 
 loved ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 ympic Champion Gabriella Papadakis leads Ice Dance International's new tou
 r\, THE SEASONS&mdash\;a celebration of artistry\, athleticism\, and speed
  that turns the rink into a living stage. Papadakis joins 2-time United St

  ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations 
 that move through four acts\; each sharing a story that takes the audience
  on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color\, emotion\, and momentum. 
  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps\, c
 risp footwork\, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's

 e audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: 
 athletic\, cinematic\, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 20

 ance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo\;THE SEAS
 ONS isn't just a show&mdash\;it's a pulse\, a spark\, a reminder that when
  blades meet music and movement meets heart\, the ice itself begins to sin
 g.&rdquo\; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be communit
 y events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI compa
 ny. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/
 cross overs\, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. C
 lasses will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth 
 and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and a
 dvance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chanc
 e for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast me
 mbers. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show\, regroup an

 er\, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us 
 wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep at
 tention\, spiritual friendship\, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll 
 reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matte
 rs in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experie
 nce of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and l
 ove.\n\nDuring this day of practice\, we’ll offer guided and silent medi

  their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and 
 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth

  unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the 
 streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffer captured iconic sc
 enes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural v
 ibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored hangout for espresso 
 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le
 vel trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is f

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if you feel frustrated or
  stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply want to start drawing 
 and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the class for you. About the 
 Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on 
 drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\, then attended Unive
 rsity of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etc
 hings have been internationally shown and collected\, but her personal pra
 ctice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, watercolor\, mixed media\, 
 and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids\, teens\, adul
 ts\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and many mediums. These days

 djacent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly\, heart-centered gathering
  where we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of 
 compassion\, protection\, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and 
 echoed across many cultures\, Jizo figures traditionally honor children an
 d all who have passed\, those in transition\, and those in distress.This o
 ngoing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war\, with a spec
 ial focus now on the approximately 19\,000 children who have perished in I
 srael and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple\, meditative act of wor
 king with clay\, we create benevolent beings that will become part of publ
 ic exhibits and peace sites\, offering spaces for reflection\, mourning\, 
 and hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives 
 of these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each 
 month at SebArts\, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open t
 o ages 12 - adult\, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay a
 nd basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.T
 here is no fee for this class\; donations are welcome to help cover materi
 als and expenses. More than a class\, this is a shared space of warmth and
  care—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love
  in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

     \n    \n  \n\nSaturday\, April 4\, 2026\; 10am-11amLocated in the Cera
 mics StudioIn this workshop\, SebArts’ Ceramics Residency artist\, Ping 
 Zhong\, will focus on the details and assembly of a teapot. Due to time an
 d space considerations\, wheel-throwing will not be demonstrated on site. 
 Instead\, pre-thrown pot bodies will be prepared as starting points. The w
 orkshop will center on shaping small components such as knobs\, spouts\, a
 nd handles\, including hand-building techniques for forming these parts\, 
 as well as methods for attaching them harmoniously to the body. The instru
 ctor will also share practical tool tips to help participants work confide
 ntly with fine details and achieve a polished finish. This workshop is rec
 ommended to be held shortly after the instructor’s arrival.Due to limite
 d capacity of the Ceramics Studio\, we are asking for a suggested donation
  of $10 to confirm your attendance. About the Artist: Ping Zhong’s artis
 tic practice is a continuous exploration of regeneration—of materials\, 
 forms\, and cultural narratives. She investigates the dialogue between anc
 ient Chinese pottery and contemporary visual language\, using wheel-throwi
 ng\, hand-building\, and sculpture to create works in which history and pe
 rsonal growth converge. This reinterpretation of classical forms is not on
 ly an artistic method\, but also a philosophical inquiry into the harmony 
 between past and future. Deeply motivated to uncover the potential within 
 clay\, Ping pushes the boundaries of design and technique. Her work reflec
 ts on universal themes: the individual’s place within the community\, th
 e relationship between essence and appearance\, and the evolving connectio
 n between nature and society. Through these explorations\, she seeks to cr
 eate art that resonates across cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Give 'Em the Axe! Ladies Night at the Range in Santa Rosa
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nJoin us for an axe-th
 rowing session to blow off some steam. I'm super excited to be able to off
 er a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curios
 ity about this fun activity\, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe 
 have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It 
 will consist of an introductory lesson\, and then we all get to practice t
 aking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice\, as they have many 
 lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive\, relaxed\, and ente
 rtaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and ta
 rgets are provided by them\, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours t
 o enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a 
 snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely
  charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots
  available\, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 per
 son\, paid to the range. Starting March 2025\, we ask that every attending
  member pay a $1 "slush" fund fee per event so that we can build up our fu
 nds for club-related expenses\, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There 
 may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-to
 ed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to mak
 e it\, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendanc
 e policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events\, you may not 
 attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your cal
 endar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on th
 e 'Going' list\, but do not show up.\n\nCheers\, and hope to see you there

SUMMARY:Emmylou Harris
DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nEmmylou Harris\n\nFriday\, April 17\, 2026\n\n8:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \nBillboard Century Award recipient\, Harris’ contribution as a singer and songwriter spans 40 years. She has recorded more than 25 albums and has lent her talents to countless fellow artists’ recordings. In recognition of her remarkable career\, Harris was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. \nHarris is one of the most admired and influential women in music. She has recorded with such diverse artists as Linda Ronstadt\, Daniel Lanois\, Bob Dylan\, Mark Knopfler\, Neil Young\, Gram Parsons\, Willie Nelson\, Dolly Parton\, Roy Orbison\, Ryan Adams\, Beck\, Elvis Costello\, Johnny Cash\, Lucinda Williams\, Lyle Lovett and Rodney Crowell. Few artists have achieved such honesty or have revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career\, Harris continues to share the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older\, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

SUMMARY:Outback Presents Justin Willman: One for the Ages Tour
DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nOutback Presents\nJustin Willman: One for the Ages Tour\n\nSaturday\, April 18\, 2026\n\n7:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \nFresh off the release of Magic Lover\, Netflix’s first-ever magic comedy special\, Justin Willman is hitting the road with his all-new One for the Ages tour. Willman is best known as the star and creator of Netflix’s Magic for Humans and Magic Prank Show\, where his signature mix of mind-blowing magic and relatable humor has made him a streaming favorite\, a viral hit (1 billion views and counting)\, and a fan favorite for families\, comedy lovers\, and skeptics alike. \nHe’s appeared on The Tonight Show\, The Today Show\, The Kelly Clarkson Show\, and Conan\, and he was recently named “Stage Magician of the Year” by the Magic Castle. He’s performed at the White House\, packed theaters across the country\, and managed to make grown adults openly weep over a card trick. But the live show? That’s where the real magic happens. \nOne for the Ages is Justin’s biggest tour to date\, featuring brand-new material and more. It’s an interactive\, laugh-filled\, sleight-of-mind experience that’s smart\, silly\, and astonishing. And yes\, it’s the kind of show you can bring your kids\, your date\, or your dad to. All ages. All generations. All-new. \nThis is one for the ages! \n\n\nVIP Ticket to include: \n\nBest available seating\nPoster\nPost-show Meet & Greet with Justin Willman\n\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.

The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa.

SUMMARY:I’m With Her
DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nI’m With Her\n\nSaturday\, June 6\, 2026\n\n8:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \n\n\nWith the 2014 formation of I’m With Her\, singer/songwriters Sarah Jarosz\, Aoife O’Donovan\, and Sara Watkins introduce an essential new force into the world of folk music: a close-knit alliance of highly esteemed musicians\, each graced with a deep understanding of folk tradition and unbridled passion for expanding its possibilities. \nOn their long awaited second LP\, Wild and Clear and Blue\, their luminous harmonies infuse a soul-searching body of work that explores themes of ancestry\, lineage\, and the collective human experience with stories about reaching into the past\, navigating a chaotic present\, and bravely moving forward into the unknown. It follows a critically lauded debut album\, See You Around\, and standalone singles\, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene\, Watkins\, Jarosz\, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival\, then co-founded I’m With Her\, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative\, fable-like storytelling\, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity\, access\, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus\, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.

The festival brings together gold-medal-winning wines from Sonoma\, Napa\, and Mendocino counties\, alongside inspired bites from some of the region’s most celebrated chefs.

As festival attendee Dennis McCarter of McCarter Cellars shared\, “The great food at the event elevates the great wine\, and the great wine elevates the great food.” Established as a must-attend event for food and wine lovers alike\, the North Coast Wine & Food Festival is more than a tasting—it’s a joyful celebration of craftsmanship\, community\, and the good life. \nMust be 21 or older to attend. \nDesignated driver tickets are available\, along with a limited selection of non-alcoholic beverages. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus\, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.

Quantity is limited at each show. Shortly after the concert\, attendees with a M&G wristband will be allowed to meet the band\, have a group photo taken\, and the opportunity to chat with band members and have merchandise or memorabilia signed.\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.
