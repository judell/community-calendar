SUMMARY:Tim & Sam Show- Valentine Day Party at Rio Nido Roadhouse
DESCRIPTION:Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be quiet—or serious. \nJoin us at Rio Nido Roadhouse for a Valentine’s Night with Tim Sawyer (Free Peoples Band) & Sam Hamby (Marshall House Project) come together for a duo set built for bad decisions and good stories. Think swampy grooves\, honey-soaked vocals\, and rhythms that slide somewhere between romance and revelry. Whether you’re locked in with your Valentine or dancing with strangers\, this is music that invites you to stay out and let the good times roll. \nWith Mardi Gras just around the corner\, we’re leaning into a little sparkle\, a little mischief\, and a whole lot of fun. \nCome solo. Come coupled. Come as a group. \nLove is optional. Music is not.\n\nSource: GoLocal Cooperative

 2026\; 1pm-3:30pm$35 Write your way into a productive and rewarding relati
 onship with revision!Session Focus: Whole-body Characters We’ll explore 
 ways to create vivid people on the page and strengthen other elements thro
 ugh character\, including point of view\, sense of place\, and emotional r
 esonance.Revision is to a first draft what marriage is to falling head-ove
 r heels. It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Re
 vision takes time\, skill\, caring\, and fortitude. It asks that we be gen
 erous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge
  what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not fo
 r the faint of heart\, but for writers committed to their relationship wit
 h creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows write
 rs to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll sha
 re a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling\,” which incorporates 
 my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction\, memoir\, and nonfic
 tion. The session includes a craft presentation\, group discussion\, and w
 riting time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful re
 vision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for 
 your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revisio
 n• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind
 • Fiction or nonfiction free write\, early draft\, or manuscript in prog
 ress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and 
 revision challenges to discuss\, particularly as relate to the session foc
 usThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each t
 ime. Check the schedule\, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About 
 the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist\, author\, and strateg
 ic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Danc
 ing at the Bluebird\,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating t
 he Creative Life\,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Mus
 ical Theater\,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolutio
 n: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and\, fo
 r publication in 2027\, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide 
 to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries
  and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Li
 terature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Int
 erdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program
  promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired he
 r to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling\, Nine
  Ways to Mastery\, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their wri
 ting practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing
  books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career\, she’s found that 
 resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resil
 ience to teaching revision as a writing skill\, as well as a practice. \n\

 ost to you and how that can be expressed through art. Catherine will help 
 you release the need for perfection and trust your creative instincts. By 
 the end of the workshop\, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but al
 so a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for t
 he art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your p
 ersonal story in your art\, Methods for sourcing interesting collage paper
 s\, Techniques for crafting textured\, multi-layered collages\, Strategies
  for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own 
 papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life
 \, copies of photos\, old letters\, books\, papers from memorable experien
 ces or travels\, or documents that hold meaning. If you’re not comfortab
 le using these documents\, you should make color copies of them. For this 
 process\, it is also best to make laser copies of your photographs.Supplie

 e observational skills and learning fundamental drawing techniques. If you
  find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring\, you can sign up for 
 the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to pr
 actice and advance their drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t 
 practiced in years\, or any artists who just want to learn more and practi
 ce with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learni
 ng to see - a skill that anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Throu
 gh demonstration\, practice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will 
 explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure 
 environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of pract
 ical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of wha
 t one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if y
 ou feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply w
 ant to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the clas
 s for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts
  with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\
 , then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printm
 aking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected\,
  but her personal practice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, waterc
 olor\, mixed media\, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats
  (kids\, teens\, adults\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and man
 y mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but
  also enjoys teaching drawing\, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n

 e. Bring a copy of your receipt at check-in to Painting/Drawing Studio adj
 acent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly\, heart-centered gathering w
 here we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of co
 mpassion\, protection\, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and ec
 hoed across many cultures\, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and 
 all who have passed\, those in transition\, and those in distress.This ong
 oing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war\, with a specia
 l focus now on the approximately 19\,000 children who have perished in Isr
 ael and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple\, meditative act of worki
 ng with clay\, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public
  exhibits and peace sites\, offering spaces for reflection\, mourning\, an
 d hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of
  these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each mo
 nth at SebArts\, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to 
 ages 12 - adult\, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and
  basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.The
 re is no fee for this class\; donations are welcome to help cover material
 s and expenses. More than a class\, this is a shared space of warmth and c
 are—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love i
 n action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

 ease consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” 
 offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffer
 ing we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can b
 e a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in 
 our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You 
 do not have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings 
 to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine
 " sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 year
 s. Her work has created an international community of people who\, by list
 ening to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and los
 s\, helped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on 
 our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a medit
 ation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditat
 e is to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wande
 rs. In poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart
  and along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. Wh
 en we witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness
 \, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a
  strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor
 : Judith Redwing Keyssar\, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in
  the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator\, end-of-life doula\,

SUMMARY:Give 'Em the Arrow Again!  Ladies Night at the Archery Range
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nI'm super excited to 
 be able to offer another ladies' Archery night in Santa Rosa! If you've ev
 er had a curiosity about archery\, this is your chance to find out more wi
 th a fun\, interactive lesson.\n\nWe have reserved a special event with th
 e indoor range on a Wednesday evening. It will consist of a basic lesson\,
  and then we all get to practice shooting. Everyone will get ample time to
  practice\, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-co
 mpetitive\, relaxed\, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are en
 couraged. All equipment is provided by them\, and we will probably get abo
 ut an hour or hour and a half to practice.\n\nI encourage everyone to brin
 g a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usua
 lly end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy
 ). Closed toe shoes recommended.\n\nThere are 17 spots available\, guests 
 welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person\, paid to the ra
 nge. Starting March 2025\, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 "sl
 ush" fund fee per event in addition to the regular fee so that we can buil
 d up our funds for club-related expenses\, which can be paid by Venmo or c
 ash.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it\, I will be doin
 g a final headcount the day of the event. There is an attendance policy fo
 r all our events: if you No-Show to three events\, you may not attend even
 ts for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so yo
 u don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' l
 ist\, but do not show up.\n\nCheers\, and hope to see you there!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club

 istration required)This course is designed for students wishing to explore
  hand-building techniques at an intermediate to advanced level and delve d
 eeper into refining their clay skills. Each session will start with a demo
 nstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative 
 pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces t
 hat might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are
  freeform coil pots\, soft slab work\, hard slab technique\, a variety of 
 sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping\, carving and te
 xtural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips a
 nd glaze that will add color to the forms we create.About the Instructor: 
 Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After h
 is college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola 
 Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick\, he r
 an a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Tu
 rkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-1
 2 art\, including Ceramics\, Drawing\, Photography\, Design and Sculpture 
 at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High S
 chool and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of the
 se schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teach
 ers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the exper
 imental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help s
 tudents explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for
  the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \

 s a great class for those who want to enjoy building something with their 
 own hands and experience the personal benefits of working with clay. Instr
 uction will cover the basics of wheel throwing\, hand-building (slab\, coi
 l\, freeform)\, and glazing techniques. Students will also have unstructur
 ed time to work on their own creations.The class will explore the benefits
  of letting go of the need to be productive and "perfect". The main goal o
 f this course is to familiarize students with how clay rooms work and why 
 they’re a fun place to be.About the Instructor: Alice Rathjen has over 4
 0 years experience working with clay. She was a production potter for five
  years. The current focus of her “art” is the sheer pleasure of playfu
 l engagement with clay. She enjoys throwing exquisite bowls\, mugs and cup
 s and seeing them go on adventures.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n

 ills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If 
 your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if you feel frustrated or
  stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply want to start drawing 
 and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the class for you. About the 
 Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on 
 drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego\, then attended Unive
 rsity of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etc
 hings have been internationally shown and collected\, but her personal pra
 ctice also includes paper cutting\, graphite\, watercolor\, mixed media\, 
 and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids\, teens\, adul
 ts\, college\, private lessons\, camps\, etc) and many mediums. These days
  Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching
  drawing\, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Give 'Em the Axe! Ladies Night at the Range in Santa Rosa
DESCRIPTION:Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nJoin us for an axe-th
 rowing session to blow off some steam. I'm super excited to be able to off
 er a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curios
 ity about this fun activity\, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe 
 have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It 
 will consist of an introductory lesson\, and then we all get to practice t
 aking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice\, as they have many 
 lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive\, relaxed\, and ente
 rtaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and ta
 rgets are provided by them\, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours t
 o enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a 
 snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely
  charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots
  available\, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 per
 son\, paid to the range. Starting March 2025\, we ask that every attending
  member pay a $1 "slush" fund fee per event so that we can build up our fu
 nds for club-related expenses\, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There 
 may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-to
 ed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to mak
 e it\, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendanc
 e policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events\, you may not 
 attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your cal
 endar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on th
 e 'Going' list\, but do not show up.\n\nCheers\, and hope to see you there

SUMMARY:I’m With Her
DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nI’m With Her\n\nSaturday\, June 6\, 2026\n\n8:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \n\n\nWith the 2014 formation of I’m With Her\, singer/songwriters Sarah Jarosz\, Aoife O’Donovan\, and Sara Watkins introduce an essential new force into the world of folk music: a close-knit alliance of highly esteemed musicians\, each graced with a deep understanding of folk tradition and unbridled passion for expanding its possibilities. \nOn their long awaited second LP\, Wild and Clear and Blue\, their luminous harmonies infuse a soul-searching body of work that explores themes of ancestry\, lineage\, and the collective human experience with stories about reaching into the past\, navigating a chaotic present\, and bravely moving forward into the unknown. It follows a critically lauded debut album\, See You Around\, and standalone singles\, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene\, Watkins\, Jarosz\, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival\, then co-founded I’m With Her\, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative\, fable-like storytelling\, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity\, access\, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website\, by phone\, or at our box office in Santa Rosa.
