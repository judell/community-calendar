SUMMARY:God of our Heart\, God of our Realization
DESCRIPTION:Rosicrucians AMORC\, Santa Rosa\, CA\nA focal point of the Ros
 icrucian teachings is mysticism\, the conscious union of the self with the
  Divine or God. The centrality of mysticism to our Order is reflected in t
 he very name of our Order\, Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis. An evolvi
 ng personal conception and realization of the Divine is part of the spirit
 ual journey of Rosicrucian students\, reflected in the Rosicrucian invocat
 ion\, “God of our Heart\, God or our Realization.” During this telecon
 ference\, Julian Johnson will lead us in exploring the dominant conception
 s of the Divine which are presented in the earliest monographs of the Rosi
 crucian studies\, in addition to the Rosicrucian conception of the Divine 
 or Absolute. We will also look at how modern neuroscience surprisingly rev
 eals connections between our conceptions of God and our body and mind.\n\n
