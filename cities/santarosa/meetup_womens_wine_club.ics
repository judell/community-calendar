 s own winery began with a single barrel of Russian River Pinot Noir produc
 ed at home.\n\nIn 2015 K Squared Cellars acquired winery and tasting room 
 space. That single barrel of Pinot Noir and a dream of having their own fa
 mily winery was realized!\n\nAbout the Artist: Tara Dickinson is our artis
 t and instructor. She has a background in fine arts and years of teaching 
 expressive art labs to all ages. She enjoys sharing tools to help everyone
  feel comfortable in the creative process while learning new techniques. S
