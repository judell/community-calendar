 is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicio
 us red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries\,”  fruit rendered so re

 up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox pe

 neath thought\, an ancient intelligence woven into the fabric of our being
 . The Buddha taught that everything needed for liberating the heart is alr
 eady here\, within this body. The path is not about becoming different\, b
 ut remembering all that has been obscured by the habits of conditioning an
 d forgetfulness.\n\nBy returning to the body as a living archive that has 
 never stopped guiding us\, we reconnect with the sacred inheritance of who
 leness—a continuity passed down through the Buddhadharma and the unbroke
 n line of ancestors whose memories flow within us. This daylong will inclu
 de silent sitting meditation\, Dharma reflections\, breath awareness\, and
  gentle interpersonal connections. During our time together we will reconn
 ect with what is already ours\, a sense of belonging\, spacious presence\,
  and the dignity of simply being alive. Open to both new and experienced

 at went through Sebastopol. The current West County Museum in downtown Seb
 astopol was the terminal.  Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14\,000 rai
 lroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set of a
 rtifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transporta
 tion\, manufacturing\, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad indu
 stry since 1956\, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pacifi
 c Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum\, Fred often ran P&S
 R passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junction
 \, the only remaining operating car from that railroad.\n\nThis talk is a 
 project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society. It will be prec

  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes\, pies\,
  and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is anoth
 er large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Th
 iebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was mad
 e of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing
  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar
 ound program lecture on Thursday\, January 29th\, 2026 to hear Wayne Thieb
 aud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid\, an OLLI instructor for Son
 oma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture\, we will be discuss
 ing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not o
 nly delicious dessert paintings\, but also landscapes and figures. In this
  discussion\, we will look at his famous works\, review his life\, and lea
 rn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the 
 SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry D

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a special event with Megan McDonald\, author of Bu

 s. This event is free\, but we appreciate your RSVP below so we can plan f
 or your attendance. ABOUT BUNNY AND CLYDE ON THE LAM They couldn’t be ou
 tlaws when they tried\, but now they’re being framed as fall guys? Judy 
 Moody creator Megan McDonald and illustrator Scott Nash bring back the lov
 able pair for a comedy full of mischief\, magic tricks\, and misperception
 s. Thornton’s shiny new coin has vanished into thin air! Did someone ste
 al it? All eyes fall on Bunny and Clyde\, two bad bunnies at the scene of 
 the crime. But wait! They’re not bad bunnies. For one thing\, Clyde is a
  chipmunk. For another thing\, every time they’ve tried to be bad\, they
  somehow came out looking as good as gold. Now\, when they really are I-N-
 N-O-C-E-N-T\, everyone decides they’re guilty? In a tight spot like this
 \, there is only one thing for a declared pair of outlaws to do. “RUN!
 ” says Bunny. “RUN!” says Clyde. They’re on the lam! Will the fugi
 tives be able to outrun the possum posse and shake their bum rap? Buckle u
 p for another wild and wicked ride with Bunny and Clyde! ABOUT FAIRY DOOR 
 DIARIES: ELIZA AND THE HOBGOBLINS Eliza has a second adventure on the othe
 r side of the fairy door—and must call on her wits when a band of impish
  hobgoblins follows her home—in this enchanting tale by the award-winnin
 g author of the Judy Moody series. What’s that? Eliza hears faint music 
 coming from behind the teeny-tiny fairy door she created low on the wall. 
 So she presses her ear to the door and—shwoosh!—is whisked into the re
 d\, rocky land of hobgoblins\, leaving behind the heaps of toys and books 
 that were strewn around her room \\(along with her mother’s orders to cl
 ean them up\\). Luckily\, Eliza discovers that the pointy-hatted hobs love
  to play\, love a mess\, and can grant wishes! But when she wishes that Ho
 bby\, Nobby\, and Tobby would help her with her room\, she learns that wha
 t hobgoblins actually love is playing tricks—and as they burst into her 
 space\, it’s clear that she’s fallen for their trickery. Can she outru
 n their mischief before they decorate all of her walls with crayon and tur
 n her ceiling fan into a hobgoblin merry-go-round? Just maybe . . . but on
 ly if she can come up with a few tricks of her own! Megan McDonald’s fol
 low-up to Eliza and the Flower Fairies\, illustrated in glowing full color
  by Lenny Wen\, is sure to be happily devoured by every child who ferventl
 y believes in fairies and other magical folk. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Megan McDon
 ald is the author of the popular Judy Moody and Stink series for older rea
 ders and the Judy Moody and Friends series for beginning readers. She has

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an entrancing afternoon with two esteemed poets\, 
 Donna Emerson and Gerald Fleming\, with selected readings from their recen
 t poetry collections\, respectively\, Daphne Lifts Up and The Bastard & Th
 e Bishop. Our audience will be swept away by musical interludes on various
  stringed instruments from award-winning composer and musician\, Jared Eme
 rson-Johnson. Local watercolor artist and college instructor\, Barbara Mar
 lin\, creator of the Daphne Lifts Up book cover will display the original 
 artwork and selected prints of other work at the event. Following the read
 ings and music\, a Q&A will follow\, with book sales and signing in the lo
 bby. Refreshments will be available for sale. This is free event\, all don
 ations always gratefully accepted.    Donna Emerson divides her time betwe
 en Petaluma\, California\, and her family homestead near Ithaca\, New York
 . Retired from teaching at Santa Rosa Jr. College and her clinical social 
 work practice\, her recent poetry publications include La Pressa\, The Pat
 erson Literary Review\, and Weber: The Contemporary West. Her chapbooks: T
 his Water\, 2007\, Body Rhymes\, 2009\, Wild Mercy\, 2011\, and Following 
 Hay\, 2013. Her poetry books are The Place of Our Meeting \\(Finishing Lin
 e Press\, 2018\\) and Beside the Well \\(Cherry Grove Collections. 2019\\)
 . And now\, Daphne Lifts Up \\(Finishing Line Press\, 2025\\). Donna has r
 eceived two nominations for the Pushcart Prize\, one for "Best of the Net\
 ," two nominations for the California Book Award \\(Body Rhymes\, 2009\, T
 he Place of Our Meeting\, 2018\\)\, five awards from the annual Allen Gins
 berg Contests\, and numerous regional awards for her poetry\, creative non
 -fiction\, and prose. Many of her poems appear in journals or anthologies 
 with her black and white or color photography. Anais Nin used Donna's port
 raits of Anais in her late diaries and press coverage in the New York Time
 s.  Donna has taught poetry to elementary school children and made it part
  of her community college classrooms \\(1990-2015\\). She worked as a volu
 nteer with Alzheimer's patients at a residential facility to help them cre
 ate individual and group poems and served as Board member and Events Chair
  for the Marin Poetry Center \\(2012-2014\\). Donna's latest book\, "Daphn
 e Lifts Up" includes poems about nature around us\, nature within us\, and
  relationships with many different people\, from family to counseling clie
 nts\, to students\, colleagues at work\, animals\, birds\, and strangers. 
 It addresses birth\, illness\, death\, and resiliency in all these verses.
     Gerald Fleming is the author of the poetry collections The Bastard and
  the Bishop \\(Hanging Loose Press\, 2021\\)\, One \\(Hanging Loose\, 2016
 \\)\, The Choreographer \\(Sixteen Rivers Press\, 2013\\)\, Night of Pure 
 Breathing \\(Hanging Loose\, 2011\\)\, and Swimmer Climbing onto Shore \\(
 Sixteen Rivers\, 2005\\). His work has appeared in many magazines over the
  decades\, including New Letters\, Michigan Quarterly Review\, Hanging Loo
 se\, Carolina Quarterly\, New World Writing\, Volt\, Paris Lit Up\, and Ve
 rsal.  Fleming edited the print magazines Barnabe Mountain Review and Forw
 ard to Velma\, the vitreous magazine One \\(More\\) Glass\, and The Collec
 ted Poetry & Prose of Lawrence Fixel \\(Sixteen Rivers\, 2021\\). He has w
 ritten numerous books for teachers\, including Rain\, Steam\, and Speed \\
 (Jossey-Bass/Wiley\, 2005\\)\, and lives most of the year near San Francis
 co\, part of the year in Paris. Fleming\, a master of the prose poem\, is 
 never satisfied to sing the same song\, and this adventuresome spirit pays
  dividends in these new prose poems. Constantly surprising and inventive\,
   The Bastard and the Bishop offers stories within stories that effortless
 ly merge the personal and the archetypal\, breathing new life into a genre
  that has increasingly\, and often sadly\, become predictable.     Jared E
 merson-Johnson is a video game music composer\, sound designer\, voice dir

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSono
 ma County artist\, Tosya Shore\, presents Celebrating Women\, paintings th
 at commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s waterc
 olor works capture women in their element\, showing the multiple facets of
  their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and 
 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every

DESCRIPTION:PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books and Read On Sonoma are honored
  to welcome literacy advocate and motivational speaker Oliver James for th
 e launch of his powerful new memoir - Unread: A Memoir of Learning \\(and 
 Loving\\) to Read on TikTok! Oliver will be joined in conversation by belo
 ved friend and local librarian\, Mychal Threets. Join us for an unforgetta

 provoking\, Unread is an inspiring\, hopeful memoir of growth and change -
  Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational n
 eglect\, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approxi
 mately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However\, at age 32\,
  with big dreams and few tools to actualize them\, he dedicated himself to
  learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliv
 er has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documen
 ted his decision to learn to read as an adult\, and his struggles and triu
 mphs along the way. Here\, he tells the full story behind his journey for 
 the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his exper
 ience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us ho
 w to be better\, more empathetic people. In just 365 days\, Oliver went fr
 om barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal o
 f finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us 
 that words and stories have power\, and that\, no matter our past\, it's n
 ever too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal
  trainer\, motivational speaker\, literacy activist\, and influencer. He h
 as been featured in or on Today\, NPR\, Jennifer Hudson Show\, Los Angeles
  Times\, Newsweek\, Rachael Ray\, and ABC News\, among many others. Additi
 onally\, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Lite
 racy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa\, California. Mychal Threets is a libra
 rian\, literary ambassador\, and the library's number one fan \\(according
  to himself\, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-
 school kid and grew up in Fairfield\, CA\, right between Sacramento and Sa
 n Francisco. Online\, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people th
 at their mental health always matters\, and he encourages everyone to know
  they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself\, Mychal is proud to
  serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/
 26\\) is his first book. His cats\, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barl
 ow\, did not help at all\, but he still appreciates them. Read On Sonoma a
  dedicated group of professionals\, educators and volunteers promoting lit
 eracy within our elementary schools. Donate directly\, meet the Executive 
 team\, and learn more about the tremendous work that they do by joining us
  that evening. For more information\, please visit their  website . Praise
 : "Unread feels like both story and concordance\, a good read and a great 
 resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But 
 mostly\, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in o
 rder to enunciate resilience\, one must learn the phonetics of desire\, su
 rvival\, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel." -Jason Reynolds\, New Yor
 k Times bestselling author of the Track series "An inspiring and deeply hu
 man story about resilience\, courage\, and the transformative power of lit
 eracy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey\, shared with millions onl
 ine\, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He
  not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late
  to learn\, to dream\, and to rewrite your own story." -Andrew Roberts\, P
 resident\, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy "Oliver James is a 
 big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave
 \, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . 
 He's the living\, breathing\, thriving example of what reading can do for 
 a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel\, there a
 re quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he 
 went through-but if their parents\, educators\, and leaders would read thi
 s memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them\, to
 o. This raw\, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has be
 en through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth
 ." -I. C. Robledo\, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By "Unread isn'
 t just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of ou
 r own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to 
 the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver J
 ames is a role model for us all." -Kelley Coleman\, author of Everything N
 o One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child "A thoughtful and inspiri
 ng story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading help
 s to change lives." -Kirkus

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 compose. As part of Trashion Season\, join us for the beloved Gallery 212

 l reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive\, one-o

 his year: Bags! In addition to dolls\, we’re expanding the exhibit to in
 clude bags—think totes\, clutches\, cross bagsm fanny packs\, coin purse
 s\, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway\, the only rule is that y
 our piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used 
 textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines\, hot
  glue guns\, irons\, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wid
 e selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life.
  BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The works
 hop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play
 \, experiment\, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery ex
 hibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through th

 f a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recolo

DESCRIPTION:with Pawan Bareja\, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with o
 ur deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is per
 sonal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the weight
  of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse\, a
 nger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are inv
 ited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through em
 bodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticing wh
 ere activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-o
 pening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner cla
 rity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what
  has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measurable\
 , and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many experie
 nce deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to love
 d ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 dsburg to life? Well… it’s time to put our money where our mouth is. A
 nd we’re doing it right! We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand

 pinion\, in other people’s opinions\, and soon\, in your opinion too): S
 teve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night
  in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Eithe
 r way\, Steve is back. He’s our main man\, living-room ringmaster\, and 
 the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an 
 MC for friends’ bands\, which eventually led to his first stand-up set -
  a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants P
 ass\, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead\, he embr
 aced the stage as a place for brutally honest\, painfully awkward life con
 fessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy\, or very\, very funny co
 medy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup 
 - a proud Midwesterner now living in California\, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist
  in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Bluegrass\, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding
  musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm\, Joh
 n Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seam
 lessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time m
 usic for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year\, with seven ac
 claimed albums and two Juno nominations\, the Jaybirds are simultaneously 
 innovative and unadorned\, sophisticated and stripped-down\, happily old-f
 ashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance\, $40 at 
 the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelcha
 ir accessible. Art gallery open during intermission\, refreshments for sal
 e.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman "one of the worl
 d's undisputed masters" of the mandolin\, famed for outstanding tone and t
 aste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular fav
 ourites for sessions and covers\, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He 
 has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded o
 n many other projects\, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The 
 Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music wit
 h highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller\; t
 he duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San 
 Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bl
 uegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary "new acoustic" qu
 artet\, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit\, renowned for highly skilled i
 nstrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed
  the Jaybirds. Of their latest album\, Folk Radio UK said "On That Other G
 reen Shore showcases an accomplished\, experienced band at the peak of the
 ir powers\, with musicianship of the very highest order." Peghead Nation c
 alled it "one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017." 
 Los Angeles\, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 201
 7. The veteran performer has played with\, among others\, Doc Watson\, Ric
 hard Greene\, John Jorgensen\, Peter Rowan\, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty.
  He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions
  by Laurie Lewis\, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher
  Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Day
 lighting the Creek as "a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the g
 lory days of early bluegrass guitar." Chilliwack\, BC-based Trisha Gagnon 
 is portrayed by Sing Out! as "one of the most versatile" and "irresistible
 " lead vocalists in bluegrass\, her strong and distinctive style ranging f
 rom "mournful and plaintive" to "hopeful and yearning." Trisha anchors wha
 t Dirty Linen magazine calls "gorgeous three-part harmonies." She's also k
 nown for songwriting\, dating back to her early days with the award-winnin
 g B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gil
 l and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo\, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his ow
 n voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contempo
 rary banjo players. "Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingli
 ng\," said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\)\, was nom
 inated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015\, and Nick is a composer wh
 o also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley S
 tation on the new Jaybird album "showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense 
 of melody\," said Green Man Review. Spokane\, WA-based Greg Spatz is haile
 d as a "world-class bluegrass fiddler" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Aud
 ition says Greg's "virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after ti
 me\," while Bluegrass Unlimited says he "lays down some seriously fine blu
 egrass fiddle" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made 
 him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast\, where he'
 s played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield\, resophonic guitar maste
 r Rob Ickes\, and many others including Laurie Lewis\, Bryan Bowers\, and 
 Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squ
 irrel\, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with h
 is wife called All Along the Sea\, and is an award-winning

DESCRIPTION:Water Tower is the current moniker of multi-instrumentalist Ke

 and. While their lineup has evolved over time\, fuelled by Feinstein’s m
 asterful song-crafting\, fiercely DIY approach\, and genre-bending sonic i
 dentity\, Water Tower have established themselves as a global force to be 
 reckoned with.\n\nPioneers of a new wave of bluegrass and old-time with a 
 distinctly punk rock flair\, Water Tower take influences from Foghorn Stri
 ngband and Bill Monroe to Rancid and Black Flag\, passing them through a u
 nique lens that magnifies the individual strength of their core and auxili
 ary members while remaining faithful to the revivalist spirit.\n\nIn 2015\
 , the band moved to LA\, where their current lineup of Kenny Feinstein \\(
 lead vocals\, guitar\, fiddle\, mandolin\\)\, Tommy Drinkard \\(banjo\, vo
 cals\\)\, Taylor Estes \\(Bass\, Vocals\, and Nicholas Leahy \\(mandolin\,
  vocals\\) can often be found busking while not in the studio or on tour.\
 n\nSince then\, Water Tower have built major momentum\, releasing a concep
 t album Fly Around \\(ft. guest vocals from Black Flag’s Ron Reyes and p
 roduced by Don Bolles of The Germs\\)\, filming 1m\\+ view viral videos\, 
 and catching the eye of A-listers including Katy Perry\, whose 2023 NYE pa
 rty they played at\, and Riff Raff\, who shouted out “Take Me Back”\, 
 the debut single from their upcoming album Live from Los Angeles\, to be r
 eleased later this year. A slew of tour dates in the US and the UK has alr

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:with Vinny Ferraro\, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis year
 long journey\, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live\, is a heart
 felt invitation to people of all ages\, at any stage of life. Together\, i
 n the spirit of community\, we will explore how contemplating death can pr
 ofoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world\, where w
 e often shy away from the reality of our mortality\, we rarely pause to co
 nsider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflec
 t on death not out of fear\, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty
  of our lives. By embracing this practice\, we come to appreciate the frag
 ility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exp
 loration of forgiveness\, gratitude\, and letting go. Through guided medit
 ations\, thoughtful inquiry\, and intimate group discussions\, we will sup
 port one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and 
 vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know ho
 w to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12
 \\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required\

  Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational
  aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group w

  for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Gu

DESCRIPTION:with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts me
 ditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary\, pr
 eparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeat
 edly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat\, Phil
 lip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms 
 an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these pra
 ctices is “The Three Renunciations\,” which establishes a discerning m
 ind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice\, th
 e Arriving Sequence\, establishes a mind state that is available for pract
 ice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined\, the fruition of these pra
 ctices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way\, we become fre
 e of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there\, we 
 turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different c
 apacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation
  practice periods\, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experi
 ence through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity a
 nd is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars\
 , but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity an
 d consistently delivering heartfelt\, fashion-resistant music that their f
 ans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa\,
  California\, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup w
 ere vocalist Mark Tate\, guitarist Jim Cassero\, bassist Jeff Barnacle\, a
 nd drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same yea
 r when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf ni
 ght club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as 
 the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest\, longest-lasting\, most important m
 etal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles an
 d being included on several important metal compilations\, Vicious Rumors 
 signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Recor
 ds\, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Va
 rney. By this time\, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vac
 ated by Perkins\; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for t
 en years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii
 \, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar\, and bassist Dave Starr rep
 laced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut\, Sold
 iers of the Night\, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European re
 sponse. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly a
 fter Moomy's departure\, but the virtuoso didn't stay long\, as he was anx
 ious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind 
 Moore\, St. Pierre was also sent packing\, and the classic Digital Dictato
 r Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert\, guitarists Thor
 pe and Mark McGee\, bassist Starr\, and drummer Howe. This group would sta
 y together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up\, Digital Dictator\, was
  released in 1988\, and as the band's popularity began to grow domesticall
 y\, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut fo
 r the label followed in 1990\, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extens
 ive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act\, it appeared
  at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into th
 e spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward tr
 end continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang 
 on: Live in Tokyo\, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese to
 ur. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe\, the group w
 as released from their contract with Atlantic\, perhaps due not only to th
 e band's relative inactivity\, but also to the declining stateside popular
 ity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record de
 als followed\, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on t
 hrough the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained
  busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next relea
 se\, Something Burning\, Carl Albert died on April 22\, 1995. The band dec
 ided to continue on\, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length 
 recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally
  released in 1996\, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by fi
 lling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European b
 ase as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-C
 hrist While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent\, the guitarist co
 uldn't approach Albert's dexterity\, and a new vocalist was needed in orde
 r for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Bria
 n O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. 
 O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn\, who appears on the 2001 re
 lease Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's
  release\, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their nin
 th studio long-player\, Warball\, which saw them returning to the more tra
 ditional\, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings
 . The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next 
 round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers\, 2013's Electric Punishment\,
  and 2016's Concussion Protocol.

 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu
 ltiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with st
 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil
 l be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Sta
 irway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein 
 Air\,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to Fr
 ance.  Roaming the streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffe
 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of 
 being there”\, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hos

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a special event with Gordon Walker\, author of Dr.
  Fun Guy's Passport to Kingdom Fungi: A Scientist's Guide to the Wild and 
 Wonderful World of Mushrooms\, Molds\, and More. This event is free\, but 
 we appreciate your RSVP below so we can plan for your attendance. ABOUT BU
 NNY AND CLYDE ON THE LAM Learn the basics of fungal biology\, foraging\, a
 nd identification in this in-depth illustrated introduction from the belov
 ed scientist\, mushroom enthusiast\, and social media star behind Fascinat
 ed By Fungi. In Dr. Fun Guy’s Passport to Kingdom Fungi\, Dr. Gordon Wal
 ker brings his scientific knowledge and love for everything fungi to the p
 age. The first section of this book is written in a comprehensive question
 -and-answer format. Starting with “What are fungi?\,” you’ll learn a
 bout everything from what mycelium is and fungi’s evolution and biochemi
 stry to how they are classified and how they impact our world today. You w
 ill also find information on best foraging practices and culinary techniqu
 es. The second half of this book introduces you to mushroom identification
  skills and profiles various mushrooms and other fungi\, from incredible e
 dibles you can find in the wild to the dangerously toxic\, medicinal\, and
  just plain weird. Finally\, you’ll find fungal phenomena\, showing the 
 amazing breadth and diversity of the fungal kingdom. With colorful and com
 prehensive science illustrations\, mushroom photography\, and QR codes lin
 king to resources to help you continue your fungal explorations\, this is 
 the perfect portal to step through into the world of mushrooms. “Gordon 
 Walker’s book is fun\, yes\, and richly illustrated\, but at the same ti
 me it’s an impressively detailed survey of the fungal kingdom and its fa
 scinating denizens\, mushrooms and molds\, yeasts\, and more.”—Harold 
 McGee\, author of On Food and Cooking and Nose Dive “Gordon Walker’s e
 nthusiasm on the pages \\(and in person\\) is contagious\, and he’s a gr
 eat evangelizer for popular mycology.”—Britt A. Bunyard\, PhD\, publis
 her of Fungi Magazine and author of Lives of the Fungi ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dr
 . Gordon Walker is an award-winning speaker\, science communicator\, publi
 shed author\, and social media star \\(@fascinatedbyfungi \\) with over 3 
 million cumulative followers.  He has a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular 
 Biology from UC Davis where his research focused on the microbial ecology 
 of wine fermentations\, bioprocess control\, and yeast genetics. He is a p
 assionate advocate for mushrooms\, fungal conservation\, and environmental
  sustainability.  His new book "Passport to Kingdom Fungi" will fundamenta
 lly transform the way people learn about mushrooms and fungi\, serving as 
 the go to resource for a whole new generation of mycophiles and people int
 erested in foraging\, wild foods\, and fermentation.

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta
 edtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B\, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip
  and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Membershi

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an

  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:with Pawan Bareja\, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with o
 ur deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is per
 sonal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the weight
  of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse\, a
 nger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are inv
 ited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through em
 bodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticing wh
 ere activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-o
 pening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner cla
 rity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what
  has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measurable\
 , and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many experie
 nce deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to love
 d ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 servations: https://www.exploretock.com/jamcellars/\n\n-\n\nRising star Mi
 chelle Lambert brings a world of experience when she steps up to the micro
 phone. This Pop singer/songwriter has toured from coast to coast making wa
 ves all over the country. Michelle's 2021 single Come to Me has caught the
  attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from 
 the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued maki
 ng music ever since. A pop folk and hip-hop artist whose career has taken 
 her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic 
 music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn
  more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n"Michelle Lambert is the kind of ele
 ctric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Wh
 ether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a c
 onfident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between 
 the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the sta
 ge before wielding her violin in classic rock goddess mode. Michelle Lambe
 rt is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!"\n\n-Den
 nis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a
  melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influenc
 es when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emo
 tional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishe
 s in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian

DESCRIPTION:With more than 50 years of experience and five advanced degree
 s\, Dr. Maria is known worldwide as a medical intuitive\, channel\, empath
 \, teacher\, and Lakota/Diné Traditional Elder.\n\nDuring this time of g
 reat upheaval in our world\, and specifically in our country\, the environ
 ments we live in and create for ourselves can have dramatic impacts on our
  cellular healing and processing. Dr. Maria Michael will talk about how cl
 imate change\, social justice and our environments impact our physical\, m
 ental\, emotional and spiritual bodies. She will talk about the importance
  of self care\, focusing on the most impacted organs\, how to recognize wh
 at is needed\, and ways in which to support yourself\, physically\, emotio
 nally\, spiritually\, and mentally. She will focus on herbal medicine and 
 other somatic and ancient methods to support the immune system. There will
  be time for an open dialogue with the audience and to answer questions. W
 hat makes this evening especially powerful is that it takes place within t
 he amplified bioenergetic field of the EESystem. As Dr. Maria speaks about
  cellular resonance\, coherence\, and restoring balance\, guests will simu
 ltaneously be immersed in a scalar-energy environment designed to support 
 optimal cellular communication and energetic harmony. The experience becom
 es more than a lecture — it becomes embodied learning.\n\nThis event off
 ers a welcoming introduction to Dr. Maria’s work. For those who feel ca
 lled to go deeper\, Dr Maria will hold on March 15th a group healing circl
 e ceremony/workshop. It is a guided interactive process\, in which each pa
 rticipant will experience a variety of techniques using light\, sound\, to
 uch\, energy and ancient wisdom healing techniques. Whether you are new to
  her work or already familiar with energy-based healing\, this evening is 
 an invitation to explore what becomes possible when wisdom\, frequency\, a
 nd intention align. We look forward to welcoming you into the field.\n\nAb
 out Dr Maria Michael\n\nDr. Maria D. Michael is a world renowned and respe
 cted medical intuitive\, channel\, empath\, healer\, psychic and teacher f
 or over 40 years. She has been awarded 5 advanced degrees \\(all Summa Cum
  Laude\\)\, including a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. She has doctorate-
 level training in Neuropsychology and Special Education and extensive post
 -doctoral studies in Psychoanalysis and Jungian Psychology. Additionally\,
  Dr. Michael is trained and experienced in EMDR\, Hypnotherapy\, LENS Neur
 ofeedback\, Neurolinguistic Programming\, Eriksonian Hypnosis Training. Sh
 e is a Lakota/Diné \\(Navajo\\) Traditional elder\, has participated in a
 nd led traditional Native ceremonies and doctored alongside Lakota Medicin
 e people. She has been sought out worldwide for her powerful Medicine Ener
 gies and Healing abilities.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nDr. Maria Michael believes that 
 we all come from the same Creation\, and that everyone has the potential a
 nd capacity to communicate with Creation. While the Lakota call Creation 
 “The Great Mystery\,” other traditions may refer to Creation\, with na
 mes such as\, “God\,” “the Universe\,” “Allah\,” “Yahweh\,
 ” “Divine Love\,” “Universal Love” or “Cosmic Consciousness.
 ”\n\nWe not only choose our human families\, but also we choose\, initia
 lly at least\, our own unique form or tradition of understanding and commu
 nication with the Great Mystery. No form or tradition is better than anoth
 er. Humans are merely attempting to understand “That” which is beyond 
 comprehension.\n\nAll messages from the Great Mystery are compassionate an
 d loving\, even though at times these messages may appear difficult. Creat
 ion’s message appears to us in whatever way we choose to comprehend it. 
 Sometimes\, we are only capable of comprehending deeply sensitive messages
  that resound in our hearts\, and sometimes only strong and “seemingly
 ” shocking messages penetrate our defenses. This loving Spirit guides us
  to remove those obstacles that stand in our way of becoming all that Crea
 tion and We intended us to be.

DESCRIPTION:Coming off the heels of a lively\, full-house record release s
 how at Sweetwater\, Wreckless Strangers continue their album release celeb
 ration with a special dinner show at the legendary West Marin roadhouse Ra
 ncho Nicasio on Saturday\, March 7\, joined by special guests\, including
  a horn section alongside the six-piece band. The Bay Area sextet is thril

 at 7:30 pm\, with dinner reservations available from 6 pm to 8 pm.\n\nWrec
 kless Strangers return to their roots with their forthcoming studio album\
 , Dirty Souls. The six-song collection marks the band’s most raw and vis
 ceral effort to date — a modern take on the arena rock of the 1970s and 
 ’80s that inspired their earliest musical influences.\n\nThe songwriting
  is among their most intimate and personal\, exploring themes of relations
 hips\, loss\, empowerment\, and perseverance. Co-lead singers Amber Morris
  and David Noble function as a single organism\, bringing the songs to li
 fe with bluesy grit\, soul\, and humanity bolstered by rock-solid\, road-h
 ewn grooves. \n\nDirty Souls is the band’s third studio outing under t
 he tutelage of Grammy-winning producer Dave Way\, who fosters a level of d
 epth and organic cohesion that firmly establishes Wreckless Strangers in S
 an Francisco’s storied rock ‘n’ roll legacy.  The first single\, "D
 irty Soul\," came out on January 23 and is available on all streaming plat
 forms. The full album comes out in late March\, but concert attendees will
  have the exclusive opportunity to purchase advance copies of the CD. Revi
 ew copies are available now\, upon request.\n\nVisit WrecklessStrangers.co

DESCRIPTION:**FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell**\n
 \n**Why Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does**\n\n**A 
 90-Minute interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeli
 ng stressed out and stuck.**\n\nFrom the author of *Ten Seconds of Boldne
 ss* and *Beyond Recovery*\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n
 \nSet goals. Made plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd ye
 t… something still isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who ar
 e doing “the right things” — in life\, work\, business\, leadership\
 , or creative endeavors — but feel stuck\, stalled\, or quietly frustrat
 ed underneath it all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re b
 roken. But because there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\n*
 *WHAT THEY DON’T TEACH YOU**\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Mo
 ve forward when confidence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking 
 without giving up responsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomp
 lete• Make progress without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself (a
 nd others) through uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded 
 in decades of **real-world experience — not theory\, hype\, or hustle cu
 lture.**\n\nEverything you’ll hear has been lived\, tested\, failed at\,
  adjusted\, and practiced in real careers\, real leadership roles\, and re
 al life.\n\n**WHAT THIS WORKSHOP IS ABOUT**\n\nThis is not a goal-setting 
 seminar.\n\nIt’s a practical\, human conversation about:\n\n• Why peop
 le stay stuck in planning and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually show
 s up (it doesn’t come first)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than re
 adiness\n\n• How small\, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nY
 ou’ll be invited to slow down\, get honest\, and reconnect with what act
 ually matters right now — without pressure or performance.\n\n**YOU WILL
  LEARN HOW TO:**\n\n• Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\
 n\n• Get clear about what you really want (not what you think you should
  want)\n\n• Stop waiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace p
 ressure with willingness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidenc
 e isn’t there yet\n\n**YOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:**\n\n• Greater clarity
  about what’s actually holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed 
 pressure• A renewed sense of direction\n\n• One honest\, doable next s
 tep forward\n\n• A practical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype.
  No fixing. No pretending.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\n**ABOUT THE FACIL
 ITATOR**\n\nShawn Langwell is an Inspirational Author\, Teacher\, and Sale
 s & Executive Gap Mindset Coach/Consultant with more than three decades of
  sales and leadership experience.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery\,
  Ten Seconds of Boldness (and its companion workbook)\, Morning Motivation
 \, and Chill.\n\nHis work is grounded\, practical\, and focused on **real 
 change — without hype\, dogma\, or pressure.**\n\nLearn more at www.shaw
 nlangwell.com\n\n**READY TO TAKE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?**\n\nFor thos
 e who are ready\, this workshop opens the door to deeper live workshops an
 d 1:1 coaching designed to help you take the next bold steps forward — a
 nd **begin manifesting the goals and changes you’ve been thinking about 
 for far too long.**\n\nNo pressure. Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alig
 nment begins — and overwhelm ends.

SUMMARY:Monoprints: Drawing & Printing Abstraction Two-day workshop

UID:260113pVaekjfiWE6CDrh2E4pRPA
DESCRIPTION:Monoprinting is a unique expression of printmaking typically 
 painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historically\
 , copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to ac
 rylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing p
 rocesses\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is possib
 le to create a “ghost” print \\(or lighter print\\) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

  machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exh
 ibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades\, exp
 loring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working m
 ethod. In addition\, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary
  relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud
  his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 yea
 rs\, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-ar

  All Seats  $25 Hailing from Croatia\, Brazil\, Seattle and New York City\
 , USA\, the Astrid Kuljanic Transatlantic Exploration Company unites four 
 musical worlds\, bound by a shared dedication and curiosity for music. Ast
 rid’s instinct for exploration brought her to New York\, where she quick
 ly became immersed in musical communities from India and Brazil\, Klezmer 
 music\, avant-garde improvisation\, and electronic experimentation.  She c
 arefully drew from these circles her new band members: accordionist Benjam
 in Rosenblum\, bassist Mat Muntz and percussionist Rogerio Boccato. The ba
 nd developed a strong connection through regular performances of Astrid’
 s original music\, arrangements of jazz and Brazilian standards\, and trad
 itional and popular songs from Eastern Europe.  Performance highlights inc
 lude The Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.\, Gramercy Theatre and Waldorf 
 Astoria in New York City\, and each performance is charged with interactiv
 e improvisation and rhythmic intensity.  The band celebrated their first a
 lbum – an energetic set of music with rolling momentum – with a sold o
 ut concert release party at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Jordana is a pioneering US Drum & Bass DJ\, musician & produce
 r based in Seattle. Recently she  launched her SpeKtra residency at Kremwe
 rk\, became an Imagine Audio artist and joined the Emergence DnB Collectiv
 e. A global performer and trans rights advocate.\n\nIn the 90s\, Jordana e
 stablished herself as one of the early pioneers of U.S. Drum and Bass\, re
 leasing a few albums for the New York-based Jungle Sky label as well as a 
 plethora of singles and remixes. \n\nHer introduction to electronic dance 
 music came in 1988 when she began listening to BBC broadcasts featuring re
 ports on the rise of acid house music. It wasn't until the early '90s that
  dance music crept into Pittsburgh\, and Jordana began frequenting many of
  the city's first rave-like parties and soon began making dance music of h
 er own. \n\nHer first signed work was an atmospheric Drum 'n' Bass remix o
 f Blondie's "Atomic" in 1995 for EMI/Chrysalis. Liquid Sky Music then star
 ted releasing her music in 1996\, beginning with the compilation track "Di
 s Soun'" featured on This Is Jungle Sky\, Vol. 2. The New York label also 
 released a few murderous albums in the subsequent years\, beginning with W
 hen Worlds Collide \\(1997\\) and continuing through Quality Rolls \\(1998
 \\) and The Cities Collection \\(2000\\). The Cities Collection was releas
 ed under the Jordana name\, though her record label ignored her wishes for
  the change and mainly pushed “1.8.7.” She now considers 1.8.7 a deadn
 ame.\n\nAs both a producer and DJ\, Jordana has toured the world as a head
 liner. She has also worked with artists such as Mike Joyce \\(formerly of 
 The Smiths\\)\, Debbie Harry and Blondie\, Lady Sovereign\, MC Kinky from 
 London/ffrr\, Yellownote and TC Izlam from Liquid Sky Records. In England 
 she played Garage as Lady J on Flex FM. \n\nJordana has been featured or a
 ppeared in Resident Advisor\, Spin\, Rolling Stone\, Knowledge \\(UK\\)\, 
 Vibe\, Raygun\, Urb\, Mixmag and Out Magazine and has been listed in Raygu
 n's "Who's Who of International DJs". She also made Out Magazine's OUT100 
 in 1999. 2014 saw her named in Harriet magazine as "12 women in black musi
 c history you should know".  In 2015 Mixmag named her as "20 women who sha
 ped the history of dance music".\n\nIn 2014\, Jordana scored the documenta
 ry Free CeCe produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress/directo
 r Laverne Cox. Jordana has dedicated her career to speaking publicly about
  trans issues and Black Lives and has been featured in several cultural bo
 oks including New York Times bestseller ‘The Rise of the Creative Class
 ’ by Richard Florida\, Michaelangelo Matos’s ‘The Underground is Mas
 sive’ and ‘Rave Culture\, an Insider’s Overview’ by Jimi Fritz and
  Virginia Smallfry. This work is close to home for Jordana as she’s a ha
 te crime survivor herself.\n\nInspired by the Black Lives Matter movement 
 in 2020\, Jordana returned with the politically-charged single ‘Fight Fo
 r Our Lives’ \\(work-in-progress\\) and a handful of newer productions\,
  teasing a full-album release. She also released ‘The Uprising’ DJ mix
  to Mixcloud and DJ’ed part of Kremwerk’s online Pride celebrations as
  well as on Seattle\, London and LA radio. In addition she performed at Se
 attle’s “Drum and Bass Tuesdays” Livestream as her debut appearance 
 which is the longest running D&B weekly event in the world. \n\n2021 saw h
 er be invited by the prolific festival and brand Dekmantel to contribute t
 o their podcast series and headlined on a lineup with Arca for Currents.fm
  as a part of Un/Tuck and Hot Mass. Additionally she appeared on EQ50 Blac
 k Herstory stream which\, supported by DJ Flight from the UK and DaFunkNYC
  made the debut appearance for the lineup online. Jordana was a writer and
  producer on the song “The Future” on Alpha Pup Records/Producer Dojo 
 with Mimi Page and iLL.Gates August of 2021. An animated music video was a
 lso published to Youtube. 2022 saw Jordana return to performing with an ar
 senal of new tracks as she makes her official in person return at Kremfest
  2022. Throughout 2023 Jordana played several events and underground raves
 .\n\nIn 2024 Jordana launched SpeKtra\, her residency at Kremwerk\, the op
 ening night featured Flava D and the night brought in DJs such as Mizeyesi
 s and a special Pride Month edition brought over B-Complex. Jordana and B-
 Complex also collaborated on a track featuring Zak Meow called Lorem Ipsum
 . She also joined the Emergence DnB Collective.

  their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and 
 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth
 ing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the

  unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the 
 streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffer captured iconic sc
 enes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural v

 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le

DESCRIPTION:with Carol Cano\, MA and Ayya Santacitta\n\nIn a world of cons
 tant change and uncertainty\, this half-day of mindfulness practice offers
  an invitation to return to what is steady and reliable. Drawing from Fore
 st Buddhist teachings and earth-based awareness\, we will cultivate a peac
 e that does not depend on conditions. A peace that arises from being fully
  present\, embodied\, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditat
 ion\, and periods of silence\, we will explore the body as part of the liv
 ing earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than 
 striving for calm\, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds 
 us—moment by moment\, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to 
 slow down\, listen deeply\, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace withi
 n our own hearts.

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma

DTEND;TZID=PDT;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260308T160000
UID:260113FWocz3z00EKLDn8CFMqKhg
DESCRIPTION:Monoprinting is a unique expression of printmaking typically 
 painterly in effect\, made by applying or painting ink to an historically\
 , copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to ac
 rylic or a gel plate\, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing p
 rocesses\, mono-printing creates one final image.  However\, it is possib
 le to create a “ghost” print \\(or lighter print\\) after the final im
 age - but it is its own image\, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn t
 his class\, we will use the idea of experimenting\, and using drawing\, tr
 acing\, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape
  to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  T
 hese found materials create all kinds of markings\, shapes and images - as
  they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the st
 encils and create openings for more texture\, shapes\, and imagery to crea
 te layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling 
 back the paper for the look\, it is the surprise element that keeps me com
 ing back to this process.  This process also works well with other printm
 aking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut in
 to shapes and images\, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper
  and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images
 .  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing\, they
  might even be considered poetic.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 e County Historical Society\, a limited edition Sprecher beer-BoDeans Orig
 inal Ginger Brew\, and numerous shows\, including a much anticipated retur
 n to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor To
 m Barrett has officially declared June 16\, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee!
  The band will debut a new song\, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee\, 
 available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Societ
 y that day. According to Kurt Neumann\, the song is a reflection of “Whe
 re you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sen
 se of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away an
 d coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there 
 to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is f
 ounded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned
  them an exuberant\, loyal\, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\
 nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid
  80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages througho
 ut the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The b
 and has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller\, and Bruc
 e Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train\, Chris Isaak\, 
 Warren Zevon\, Joan Osbourne\, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Pe
 rhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and m
 ajor festival\, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest s
 hows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that 
 a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things\,” “You Don’t Get M
 uch\,” “Idaho\,” “If It Makes You\,”“Stay\,”“All The World
 \,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternativ
 e sound has achieved many milestones\, including a Rolling Stone Reader’
 s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987\, support slots with U2\, Bob Dy
 lan\, Paul Simon\, Tom Petty\, George Thorogood\, The Pretenders\, David B
 owie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid\, Summerfest\, ACL Festi
 val and others\, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live\,” 
 “Letterman\,” “Today\,” “Imus\,” CNN\, and ESPN\, to name a fe
 w. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original se
 ries\, The Ranch\, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott\, Ashton
  Kutcher\, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent i
 nstallation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part 
 of their Midwest Artists exhibit.

  are transferred from Damacus\, Syria\, to Jerusalem\, Jordan in late 1955

 only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in th

 ful\, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and 
 generous neighbors. Ten years ago\, I picked up volume number one of "The 
 Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night" translated by Sir Richard Franc
 is Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her
  emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of eve

  new fascinating 4 week class: Jewpernatural: Signs\, Spirits\, and Super

 ition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud\, Jewish p
 hilosophy\, and Kabbalah\, Jewpernatural offers a grounded\, thoughtful ap
 proach to topics that often generate curiosity\, skepticism\, and uncertai
 nty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\
 n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal \\(souls\, angels\, spirits\, and
  the afterlife\\)\n\n“People are curious about these topics\, but they a
 lso want serious\, authentic answers\,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Cha
 bad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate my
 th from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\
 nThe course is open to all\, regardless of background or prior Jewish lear
 ning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural \\(4-weekcourse\\) When: Begi

SUMMARY:Poetry Book Club: My Infinity by Didi Jackson

DESCRIPTION:Each month\, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one 
 must-read book of poems\, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning c
 ontemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson\, who has been an enthusi
 astic book club member since its beginning\, meetings are open to all leve
 ls of poetry readers\, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK 
 WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection
 \, My Infinity\, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical
  meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poe
 ms investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and em
 otional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of t
 his collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hil
 ma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction\, her radical
  work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly
  boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly\, Jackson's poems exp
 lore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont\, wh
 ere perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a 
 book that questions all that is endless\, all that has been thought as lim
 iting\, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an 
 American poet and professor. In 2020\, she released her debut poetry colle
 ction\, Moon Jar\, and in 2024\, she released another titled My Infinity\,
  both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vander
 bilt University

  CostAdvance your drawing skills with deep study of composition\, value\, 
 and technique. Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\
 n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class\, we will explore composition\, value\
 , and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing cl
 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or
 der to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes 
 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths 
 and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own proce
 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br
 ing the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with cli
 ps\, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long
  as the paper is drawing quality\\)\, soft willow charcoal\, compressed ch
 arcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\)\, white plastic eraser\, notebook\, Sta

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Li
 brary and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuse
 s on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event\,
  but we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look f
 orward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK \\#1 New York Times best seller! B
 ooklist Editors’ Choice 2015 - Youth! Named a "Best Book of 2015" by Tim
 e Magazine\, School Library Journal\, Barnes & Noble\, NPR\, PopSugar\, Th
 e Millions\, and The News & Observer! Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One w
 ho's ever been chosen. That's what his roommate\, Baz\, says. And Baz migh
 t be evil and a vampire and a complete git\, but he's probably right. Half
  the time\, Simon can't even make his wand work\, and the other half\, he 
 starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him\, his girlfriend broke
  up with him\, and there's a magic-eating monster running around\, wearing
  Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this\, if he were 
 here--it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks\, and Simon's 
 infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost sto
 ry\, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking a
 s you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far\, far more monsters. 
 "Rowell imbues her magic with awe and spectacle. It's a powerful\, politic
 ally minded allegory about sexual\, ethnic and class identity - with a hea
 dy shot of teenage lust." —New York Times Book Review "It’s a brillian
 tly addictive\, genuinely romantic story about teenagers who can’t be ne
 atly sorted into houses\, coping with stress and loss and the confusion of
  just trying to be who they are. It’s as if Rowell turned the Harry Pott
 er books inside out\, and is showing us the marvelous\, subversive stuffin
 g inside." —Time Magazine "Full of heart and humor\, this fantastical ta
 le is a worthy addition to the wizarding-school genre." —People Magazine
  ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rainbow Rowell is the award-winning \\#1 New York Times 
 bestselling author of Eleanor & Park and the Simon Snow Trilogy\, plus sev
 eral other novels\, short stories\, and comics. She lives in Omaha\, Nebra
 ska\, just like most of her characters.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 y\, March 12\, 5:30-7:30pmAdmission is Free but space is limited so reserv
 e your ticket/s now before it is sold out.\n\nAbout Americana Reimagined: 
 On the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States\, Americana 
 Reimagined invited artists from across the greater Bay Area to explore\, r
 einterpret\, and reimagine the visual language of &ldquo\;Americana&rdquo\
 ;. This juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar s
 ymbols\, stories\, and styles evolve over time&mdash\;bridging the past an
 d present through creativity and craft. \n\n&ldquo\;Americana&rdquo\; has 
 long served as a reflection of everyday life and culture\, from small-town
  iconography and handmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. 
 In Americana Reimagined artists reexamine this broad theme\, juxtaposing t
 he old and the new\, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh per
 spectives on what they mean today.\n\nJurors \n\nDonna Seager\, Donna Seag
 er Fine Arts &amp\; Artists' Books  Richard Neill\, Multimedia Artist and 
 Film curator Simon Corwin\, Petaluma Artist and Jewelry\n\nStates of Anxie
 ty\, States of HopeExhibition Dates: March 12 - April 18\, 2026Opening Rec
 eption: Thursday\, March 12\, 5:30-7:30pm\n\nAbout States of Anxiety\, Sta
 tes of Hope: This exhibition presents a selection of works by artist Inez 
 Storer that reflect on the emotional\, cultural\, and political complexiti
 es of contemporary life. Building on themes explored in Americana Reimagin
 ed\, Storer's paintings offer a layered meditation on identity\, memory\, 
 and collective experience in times of uncertainty and transformation.\n\nT
 hrough her distinctive magical realist collage method\, Storer constructs 
 richly textured visual narratives that merge personal history with broader
  social realities. Her works are composed of fragments&mdash\;symbols\, im
 ages\, and artifacts drawn from her life and interests.\n\nStorer's painti
 ngs guide the viewer on a journey through both historical memory and inter
 nal landscapes. They balance darkness and light\, anxiety and hope.  She a
 sks us to reflect on the conditions of our moment. States of Anxiety\, Sta
 tes of Hope affirms art's capacity to illuminate struggle while nurturing 
 resilience\, empathy\, and connection.

 beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSono
 ma County artist\, Tosya Shore\, presents Celebrating Women\, paintings th
 at commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s waterc
 olor works capture women in their element\, showing the multiple facets of
  their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and 
 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth
 ing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the
  Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks
  Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein Air\, a collection
  unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the 
 streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffer captured iconic sc
 enes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural v
 ibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored hangout for espresso 
 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le
 vel trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is f
 or Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through th
 ese plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of being there”\, stat
 ed Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on M

DESCRIPTION:with Pawan Bareja\, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with o
 ur deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is per
 sonal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the weight
  of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse\, a
 nger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are inv
 ited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through em
 bodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticing wh
 ere activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-o
 pening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner cla
 rity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what
  has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measurable\
 , and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many experie
 nce deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to love
 d ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\

 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin

 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura

 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B

DESCRIPTION:Join us at Snoopy's Home Ice for an evening of art and athleti
 cism of Dance on Ice.\n\nSnoopy's Home Ice\n\nMarch 13th 2026 at 7PM\n\nOl
 ympic Champion Gabriella Papadakis leads Ice Dance International's new tou
 r\, THE SEASONS&mdash\;a celebration of artistry\, athleticism\, and speed
  that turns the rink into a living stage. Papadakis joins 2-time United St
 ates Champion Alissa Czisny and skating artist Rohene Ward in a company of
  ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations 
 that move through four acts\; each sharing a story that takes the audience
  on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color\, emotion\, and momentum. 
  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps\, c
 risp footwork\, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's 
 2025 tour.\n\nPapadakis\, Czisny and Ward's presence elevates every phrase
 &mdash\;their power\, musical instinct\, and magnetic connection ignite th
 e audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: 
 athletic\, cinematic\, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 20
 26\, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance d
 ance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo\;THE SEAS
 ONS isn't just a show&mdash\;it's a pulse\, a spark\, a reminder that when
  blades meet music and movement meets heart\, the ice itself begins to sin
 g.&rdquo\; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be communit
 y events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI compa
 ny. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/
 cross overs\, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. C
 lasses will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth 
 and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and a
 dvance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chanc
 e for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast me
 mbers. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show\, regroup an
 d get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.

 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth
 ing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the

  Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein Air\, a collection
  unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the 
 streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffer captured iconic sc
 enes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural v
 ibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored hangout for espresso 
 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le
 vel trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is f
 or Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through th
 ese plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of being there”\, stat

DESCRIPTION:with Dana DePalma\, MA\, MFT and Matthew Brensilver\, PhD\n\nT
 he Buddha says that wise view is the starting point—it is also the culmi
 nation of awakening. Yet\, delusion comes camouflaged as wisdom. What we 
 do not yet understand shapes our view and obscures freedom. What are the p
 rocesses by which we realize and align with our deepest knowing?\n\nTogeth
 er\, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us 
 wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep at
 tention\, spiritual friendship\, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll 
 reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matte
 rs in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experie
 nce of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and l
 ove.\n\nDuring this day of practice\, we’ll offer guided and silent medi
 tation practice\, Dharma reflections\, and time for dialogue. All are welc
 ome.

 \n\nSonoma County artist\, **Tosya Shore\,** presents **Celebrating Women\
 ,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. 
 Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element\, showing the mu

 rong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways
 .  A la Degas\, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Poin
 t.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” wher
 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th
 e woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feelin
 g in these everyday moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – wo
 men deserve nothing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore wil

 r captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catch
 es a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored h
 angout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure risin
 g from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel To
 wer in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris 
 – I hope through these plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of

 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje

 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:Take a guided hike to the historic orchard\, now part of Jack 
 London State Historic Park\, and learn about its remarkable restoration. 
  Along the way\, keep an eye out for seasonal wildflowers and perhaps the 
 first delicate blossoms on early blooming fruit trees.\n\nOriginally plant
 ed between 1908 and 1912\, the orchard flourished in Jack London’s time 
 before being abandoned for many years. Today\, thanks to dedicated restora
 tion efforts\, it can once again be enjoyed by all who walk its trails.\n\
 nThe experience begins with an overview presented by Eric Metz\, Director 
 of Operations\, who will share the history of the orchard and the challeng
 es involved in its revival. From there\, participants will hike through re
 dwoods and mixed oak woodlands on a moderate\, six-mile round-trip trek to
  the orchard.\n\n At the orchard\, guests will tour the areas that have b
 een thoughtfully revitalized and learn about unique obstacles overcome in 
 restoring this landscape.

DESCRIPTION:with James Baraz\, MA\n\nSpring is a natural time to reflect o
 n what we are holding on to and what may be ready to be released. Just wha
 t does the phrase “let go” mean? Renunciation \\(nekkhama in Pāli\\)
 \, one of the ten perfections\, is often misunderstood as sacrifice—some
 thing we should do because it’s “good for us.” In early Buddhist tea
 chings\, nekkhama is described not as deprivation\, but as a letting go 
 that supports genuine contentment and well-being\, rooted in seeing more c
 learly what leads to suffering and what leads to freedom.\n\nDuring this d
 aylong program\, which includes periods of guided silent sitting and walki
 ng meditation\, participants will explore how habitual grasping—to thoug
 hts\, personal stories\, possessions\, roles\, and a sense of control—sh
 apes inner experience and contributes to stress. Drawing from contemplativ
 e teachings and incorporating perspectives from psychology on attachment a
 nd habitual mental patterns\, our reflections and practices will focus on 
 meeting these patterns with awareness and kindness\, loosening unhelpful s
 elf-stories\, softening the impulse to control\, and cultivating generosit
 y. This program is educational in nature and welcomes both new and experie
 nced practitioners.

DESCRIPTION:In this 4 week course\, participants will learn a unique appro
 ach to watercolor\, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experi
 ence when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will f
 ocus on strengthening one’s observational skills\, giving the artist a f
 oundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering
  process\, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject ma
 tter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These sub
 jects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike\; their organi
 c shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects\, but their beauty can be a 
 muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from li
 fe\, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique.
  With 4 class sessions\, participants will have the opportunity to develop
  their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like 
 it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemi

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

DESCRIPTION:Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associate
 d with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s.
  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit
 ion will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career\, from he
 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t

 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag

 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

 asses have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in or

 the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When 
 drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths

 ss will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can 
 be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process\, you
  will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a 
 basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please br

DESCRIPTION:January 9–March 22\, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of bloom
 ing miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season
 ’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire maje
 stic magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias in bloom\, or join a tour or pro
 gram to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation
  by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) h
 ighlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs tr
 ained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate
  plum\, azalea\, camellia\, cherry\, and apricot bonsai take center stag
 e\, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. The
 se early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty an
 d resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also
  draws inspiration from hanami\, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of 
 celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors t
 o participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls
 —guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming
  magnolias\, cherries\, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.

  Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions 
 bustling with animals of all kinds-her "beasties" as she calls them-formin
 g surreal\, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological ar
 rangements represent alternate realities\, infusing exuberance and a sense
  of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive\, her textura
 l creature patterns revel in the extreme\, often taking up every inch of t
 he canvas\, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-B
 right invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibit

 r early days of the Funk Movement to today.

DESCRIPTION:There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feel
 s like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way
 . His voice is raw and real\, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’
 s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest\, and that’s
  exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Am
 ericana\; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie\, blues lege
 nds like Howlin’ Wolf\,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe\, an
 d master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and c
 onnects audiences\, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren
 ’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s so
 ft and haunting\, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay wi
 th you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sou
 nd. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness\, conn
 ection\, love\, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band s
 how\, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOv
 er the years\, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless to
 uring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists 
 like Shakey Graves\, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\, Sarah Jarosz\, and Alic
 e O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock\, SXSW\, and High Si
 erra Music Festival\, but his focus has always been on making music that m
 eans something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending y
 ears on the road\, self-funding his albums\, and navigating the ups and do
 wns of life as an independent artist\, husband\, and father. But through i
 t all\, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music th
 at connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real\, that makes
  you stop and listen\, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.

 ma County artist\, Tosya Shore\, presents Celebrating Women\, paintings th
 at commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s waterc
 olor works capture women in their element\, showing the multiple facets of
  their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and 
 interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas\,
  we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The arti
 st takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk
  shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Bac
 k from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in quest
 ion catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these every
 day moments\, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve noth
 ing less\,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the
  Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks
  Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La\, Plein Air\, a collection
  unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the 
 streets of Paris\, toting paints and palette\, Schaffer captured iconic sc
 enes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural v
 ibe in “Café le Bistro”\, the site of a favored hangout for espresso 
 and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-le
 vel trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is f
 or Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through th
 ese plein air vignettes\, to share the excitement of being there”\, stat
 ed Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on M

 e dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene. 
    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as th

 y Stress

DESCRIPTION:with Pawan Bareja\, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with o
 ur deepest heart values\, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is per
 sonal heartbreak\, economic pressure\, relational conflict\, or the weight
  of the climate crisis\, the body often reacts with anxiety\, collapse\, a
 nger\, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are inv
 ited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through em
 bodied heart practices.\n\nEach week\, we will begin by gently noticing wh
 ere activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-o
 pening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner cla
 rity. After practice\, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what
  has shifted\, revealing resilience as something softly felt\, measurable\
 , and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens\, many experie
 nce deeper rest\, clearer thinking\, a renewed sense of connection to love
 d ones\, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.

 , participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor\, intended to al
 leviate the frustration that many experience when learning this beautiful 
 yet challenging medium. We will focus on strengthening one’s observation
 al drawing skills\, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build t
 heir paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist t
 o see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sa
 mpling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and e
 xperienced artists alike\; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawin
 g subjects\, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah 
 Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her uniq
 ue approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. Th
 is class will work both from photographs and from life\, practicing observ
 ational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessio
 ns\, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and bu
 ild muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its
  own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials a
 re provided.
