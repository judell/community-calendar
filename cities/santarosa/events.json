It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Revision takes time, skill, caring, and fortitude. It asks that we be generous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not for the faint of heart, but for writers committed to their relationship with creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows writers to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll share a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling,” which incorporates my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction, memoir, and nonfiction. The session includes a craft presentation, group discussion, and writing time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful revision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revision• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind• Fiction or nonfiction free write, early draft, or manuscript in progress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and revision challenges to discuss, particularly as relate to the session focusThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each time. Check the schedule, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist, author, and strategic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolution: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and, for publication in 2027, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired her to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling, Nine Ways to Mastery, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their writing practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career, she’s found that resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resilience to teaching revision as a writing skill, as well as a practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Together, we’ll explore soil regeneration, biodiversity, systems thinking, and economic sustainability while renewing our collective inspiration and momentum.

    "description": "with Amana Brembry Johnson\n\nThere is a knowing that lives beneath thought, an ancient intelligence woven into the fabric of our being. The Buddha taught that everything needed for liberating the heart is already here, within this body. The path is not about becoming different, but remembering all that has been obscured by the habits of conditioning and forgetfulness.\n\nBy returning to the body as a living archive that has never stopped guiding us, we reconnect with the sacred inheritance of wholeness—a continuity passed down through the Buddhadharma and the unbroken line of ancestors whose memories flow within us. This daylong will include silent sitting meditation, Dharma reflections, breath awareness, and gentle interpersonal connections. During our time together we will reconnect with what is already ours, a sense of belonging, spacious presence, and the dignity of simply being alive. Open to both new and experienced practitioners.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

This acoustic trio (occasionally a quartet) is perfect for smaller venues (no drums) but they nevertheless generate a big response from audiences with their friendly banter and responsiveness to requests from audience members. This is a band with a sense of humor that can easily move between material designed to get you up on your feet dancing or tugging at your heart to buy another beer and lose your sorrows. Their musical palette runs from Bob Wills to Doc Watson to Django Reinhardt and more. The band recently celebrated their first recorded project, Masqurade 2020, which is already garnering critical success. \nDoors Open: 12:30 PM | Show Starts: 1:00 PM\nTickets $17 in advance. $25 at door",

    "description": "Join us for a special event with Megan McDonald, author of Bunny and Clyde On the Lam, and Fairy Door Diaries: Eliza and the Hobgoblins. This event is free, but we appreciate your RSVP below so we can plan for your attendance. ABOUT BUNNY AND CLYDE ON THE LAM They couldn’t be outlaws when they tried, but now they’re being framed as fall guys? Judy Moody creator Megan McDonald and illustrator Scott Nash bring back the lovable pair for a comedy full of mischief, magic tricks, and misperceptions. Thornton’s shiny new coin has vanished into thin air! Did someone steal it? All eyes fall on Bunny and Clyde, two bad bunnies at the scene of the crime. But wait! They’re not bad bunnies. For one thing, Clyde is a chipmunk. For another thing, every time they’ve tried to be bad, they somehow came out looking as good as gold. Now, when they really are I-N-N-O-C-E-N-T, everyone decides they’re guilty? In a tight spot like this, there is only one thing for a declared pair of outlaws to do. “RUN!” says Bunny. “RUN!” says Clyde. They’re on the lam! Will the fugitives be able to outrun the possum posse and shake their bum rap? Buckle up for another wild and wicked ride with Bunny and Clyde! ABOUT FAIRY DOOR DIARIES: ELIZA AND THE HOBGOBLINS Eliza has a second adventure on the other side of the fairy door—and must call on her wits when a band of impish hobgoblins follows her home—in this enchanting tale by the award-winning author of the Judy Moody series. What’s that? Eliza hears faint music coming from behind the teeny-tiny fairy door she created low on the wall. So she presses her ear to the door and—shwoosh!—is whisked into the red, rocky land of hobgoblins, leaving behind the heaps of toys and books that were strewn around her room \\(along with her mother’s orders to clean them up\\). Luckily, Eliza discovers that the pointy-hatted hobs love to play, love a mess, and can grant wishes! But when she wishes that Hobby, Nobby, and Tobby would help her with her room, she learns that what hobgoblins actually love is playing tricks—and as they burst into her space, it’s clear that she’s fallen for their trickery. Can she outrun their mischief before they decorate all of her walls with crayon and turn her ceiling fan into a hobgoblin merry-go-round? Just maybe . . . but only if she can come up with a few tricks of her own! Megan McDonald’s follow-up to Eliza and the Flower Fairies, illustrated in glowing full color by Lenny Wen, is sure to be happily devoured by every child who fervently believes in fairies and other magical folk. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Megan McDonald is the author of the popular Judy Moody and Stink series for older readers and the Judy Moody and Friends series for beginning readers. She has also written many other chapter books and picture books for children, including two books in the Fairy Door Diaries early chapter-book series. Megan McDonald lives in California.",

    "description": "Four Performances Remaining -\n\nMy Children! My Africa! is Athol Fugard’s masterpiece about South Africa circa 1985.  In the last gasp of Apartheid, violent protest and resistance on all sides is at its height. A gentle Black high school teacher in a rural township invites a White high school girl from the town nearby to form a radical, cross-racial competitive debate team with his best pupil.  The racial, economic, and identity conversation that blossoms among the three is cut off as the revolutionary wave sweeps them all away.  Your heart will ache at the beauty of the language and the storytelling from South Africa’s master-writer, Fugard. Directed by Robert Parsons.\n\nHope has broken loose in Athol Fugard’s My Children! My Africa!, and those eager to embrace it had best beware, hope as a dream that evolves into a nightmare reality, it is heartbreaking. — New York Times\n\nFeaturing:\n\nMr. M – Ansley Valentine\n\nThami Mbikwana – Isaac Addai\n\nIsabel Dyson – Emma Lenza\n\n Play sponsored in part by Barbara Carlisle and Ed Brakeman\n\nTHE 222 / 222 Healdsburg Avenue / Healdsburg CA",

This is free event, all donations always gratefully accepted.    Donna Emerson divides her time between Petaluma, California, and her family homestead near Ithaca, New York. Retired from teaching at Santa Rosa Jr. College and her clinical social work practice, her recent poetry publications include La Pressa, The Paterson Literary Review, and Weber: The Contemporary West. Her chapbooks: This Water, 2007, Body Rhymes, 2009, Wild Mercy, 2011, and Following Hay, 2013. Her poetry books are The Place of Our Meeting \\(Finishing Line Press, 2018\\) and Beside the Well \\(Cherry Grove Collections. 2019\\). And now, Daphne Lifts Up \\(Finishing Line Press, 2025\\). Donna has received two nominations for the Pushcart Prize, one for \"Best of the Net,\" two nominations for the California Book Award \\(Body Rhymes, 2009, The Place of Our Meeting, 2018\\), five awards from the annual Allen Ginsberg Contests, and numerous regional awards for her poetry, creative non-fiction, and prose. Many of her poems appear in journals or anthologies with her black and white or color photography. Anais Nin used Donna's portraits of Anais in her late diaries and press coverage in the New York Times.  Donna has taught poetry to elementary school children and made it part of her community college classrooms \\(1990-2015\\). She worked as a volunteer with Alzheimer's patients at a residential facility to help them create individual and group poems and served as Board member and Events Chair for the Marin Poetry Center \\(2012-2014\\). Donna's latest book, \"Daphne Lifts Up\" includes poems about nature around us, nature within us, and relationships with many different people, from family to counseling clients, to students, colleagues at work, animals, birds, and strangers. It addresses birth, illness, death, and resiliency in all these verses.    Gerald Fleming is the author of the poetry collections The Bastard and the Bishop \\(Hanging Loose Press, 2021\\), One \\(Hanging Loose, 2016\\), The Choreographer \\(Sixteen Rivers Press, 2013\\), Night of Pure Breathing \\(Hanging Loose, 2011\\), and Swimmer Climbing onto Shore \\(Sixteen Rivers, 2005\\). His work has appeared in many magazines over the decades, including New Letters, Michigan Quarterly Review, Hanging Loose, Carolina Quarterly, New World Writing, Volt, Paris Lit Up, and Versal.  Fleming edited the print magazines Barnabe Mountain Review and Forward to Velma, the vitreous magazine One \\(More\\) Glass, and The Collected Poetry & Prose of Lawrence Fixel \\(Sixteen Rivers, 2021\\). He has written numerous books for teachers, including Rain, Steam, and Speed \\(Jossey-Bass/Wiley, 2005\\), and lives most of the year near San Francisco, part of the year in Paris. Fleming, a master of the prose poem, is never satisfied to sing the same song, and this adventuresome spirit pays dividends in these new prose poems. Constantly surprising and inventive,  The Bastard and the Bishop offers stories within stories that effortlessly merge the personal and the archetypal, breathing new life into a genre that has increasingly, and often sadly, become predictable.

From his humble beginnings as a street performer, to being featured on the \\#1 rated show in the USA – Dancing With The Stars. Guitarist and creative force behind the event, Benise, comments “I wanted to push the boundaries of Nuevo Flamenco/Spanish guitar while combining the elements of dance and theater. This show is a celebration of all the shows we’ve done over the last 25 years.” \n\nThe Emmy Award-winning composer along with an international cast of musicians and dancers will entertain audiences with a two-hour show that “is an escape from all of their problems,” Benise says. Beyond the new material, Benise says “the live show will incorporate some fan favorites from my street performing days and rock classics like Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.” In addition, Benise adds his signature touch to classics such as “Ave Maria, “Moonlight Sonata,” and Vivaldi’s “Summer” from The Four Seasons.\n\nBenise adds, “This is a great show for the whole family; I really think we have something for everyone. I hope people will be inspired by our story, by the music, by the production--and have the passion to follow their own dreams.” \n\nThe Theatrical World Music and Dance spectacle that has been called “The Latin Riverdance” \n\n‘The Prince of Spanish Guitar’  - Dancing With The Stars\n\n‘Bennissimo!’ - Chicago News\n\n‘Extreme Flamenco Fusion’ - Screen India",

    "description": "Bone by Bone: The Commingled Remains from theTomb at Tell Abraq, UAE (2200-2000 BC)  The tomb at the archaeological site of Tell Abraq, located near modern-day Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was discovered in 1989 and excavated over several field seasons. Over 300 individuals were placed in the tomb including premature and newborn infants, toddlers, teens, and adult males and females of all ages. Over time,the addition of corpses caused the disarticulation of most all of the skeletal remains. Our analysis proceeded on a bone by bone basis and questions about health and disease, trauma and violence, and diet and nutrition were addressed using innovative methods for skeletal analysis. \"Osteobiographies\" were created that provide a glimpse into what life was like over 4000 years ago in in the deserts of Arabia. And, one very enigmatic teenager, the only individual whose remains were not commingled, and perhaps the last person to be put in the tomb, provides a poignant reminder of the toll that disease takes.Event Details    Sunday, February 22nd from 4-5 pm    SRJC Petaluma Student Center in Mike Smith Hall    Debra L. Martin, Distinguished Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, is an expert on violence in past societies, which includes expertise in human osteology and bioarchaeology. She received her PhD from the University of Massachusetts. The analysis of skeletonized human remains from archaeological as well as historic and contemporary settings form a basis for understanding the effects of trauma, fractures, disability and wounds related to lethal and nonlethal violence. She is the Series Editor for Bioarchaeology and Social Theory, a book series dedicated to cutting-edge bioarchaeological work published by Springer Verlag. She is also the Editor of the journal, American Antiquity. Her recent publications include co-authoring Gender Violence in the American Southwest (AD 1100) (Routledge), co-editing Bioarchaeology of Borders and Frontiers (UPF), Massacres (UPF), and Bioarchaeological and Forensic Perspectives on Violence (Cambridge).

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

He studied black-and-white photography in college and had plans to be a photojournalist until life intervened. After spending an adulthood in law enforcement, Phil picked up his camera again and began making art.  Phil’s preference is nature/landscape, but he is drawn to shapes, lines, and shadows found in urban landscapes. “My favorite subjects are old rusted cars, trains, abandoned buildings, and brightly colored doors.  I use several plugins in Photoshop to create surreal images from otherwise ordinary photos.  I create photos in both color and black and white, depending on subject matter and mood.”\n\nPhil is President of the Napa Valley Photographic Society, and a member of the Fairfield Suisun Valley Art Association, the Vacaville Art League, Gold Rush Photo Club, and the Lightwriters Photography Club.  Phil is also a member of the Professional Photographers of America, and the Photographic Society of America.\n\nPhil’s work has been shown at Viewpoint Gallery, Sacramento; Yountville Community Center, The Old Sugar Mill, Arata Fine Arts Gallery, and the Roseville Brewing Company, including shows at the Vacaville Art Gallery, the Napa Public Library, Solano Town Center Gallery, the Gallery at Village 360, and he is a resident artist at The Little Shop in Benicia.  He has won several awards at local shows and contests, including a Juror's Choice Award at the 2013 Vacaville Art Gallery Juried Art Show.  Phil’s photos can be seen at www.philipvenablephotography.com.  He is also on Facebook as Philip Venable Photography.  Contact Phil at philven@comcast.net.\n\nNapa Valley Photographic Society \\(NVPS\\) promotes the art and science of photography, providing education, image appreciation, inspiration, exchange of technologies.

Slow down, look closely, and deepen your appreciation for the small but essential elements that help shape and support the park’s ecosystems.  This hike will be about 1.2 miles roundtrip on uneven terrain. Sturdy walking shoes and weather appropriate layers are recommended.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

    "description": "**Mark Hummel’s 35th Annual Blues Harmonica Blowout with Mark Hummel, Magic Dick, Steve Freund, Anson Funderburgh, Rodrigo Mantovani, RJ Mischo, Curtis Salgado, and drummer Wes Starr.**\n\nMark Hummel’s Blues Harmonica Blowout™ started on a Sunday night in 1991 at Ashkenaz in Berkeley with four harmonica players: Rick Estrin, Mark, Dave Earl and Doug Jay. Each player performed a twenty-to-thirty minute set, and everyone jammed together with Hummel’s Blues Survivors as backup. Over the next five years, it grew to become a multi venue event around California and included bigger names like William Clarke, Norton Buffalo, and Paul DeLay. By the year 2000 the Blowout was headlining Yoshi’s in Oakland as a four-night show with Rod Piazza, Kim Wilson, Rick Estrin, James Harman and Billy Branch. These shows were recorded for Mountain Top Records.  \n\nSince then, the Blues Harmonica Blowout has become a who’s who of older and younger players, black, white, male and female, national, and international. From icons like Snooky Pryor, Carey Bell, James Cotton, Charlie Musselwhite, John Mayall, John Hammond, Little Sonny, Lazy Lester, Billy Boy Arnold, Sam Myers, Corky Siegel, Magic Dick, Huey Lewis, Lee Oscar, Jerry Portnoy, Howard Levy and Paul Oscher to younger players like Sugar Ray Norcia, Jason Ricci, Son Of Dave, Aki Kumar, Curtis Salgado, Kenny Neal, RJ Mischo, Sugar Blue, Annie Raines, Carlos Del Junco, just to name a few. \n\nThe selection of guitarists has also been a stunner including Duke Robillard, Rusty Zinn, Bob Welsh, Little Charlie Baty, Anson Funderburgh, Jr. Watson, Billy Flynn, Steve Freund, Mike Keller, and many more.",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40. Materials fees are not discounted.\n\nBecome a member today and find community, connection, and creativity.",

    "description": "Creating your estate plan, whether it’s a living trust or a will, can be a daunting task.  Estate planning addresses issues that are difficult to think about, such as death, incapacity, finances, and family dynamics.  It can be easy to procrastinate, even though these issues may weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our upcoming free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating \\(or updating\\) your estate plan.  This is an educational webinar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help.  The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this webinar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts, and probate\n\nProtecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims\n\nMost living trusts fail; if you already have a trust, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones\n\nHow to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n\nHow to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan \\($425 value\\).",

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now? Practices: Guided movement warm-up; sensory awareness; movement exploration of stepping toward/away from a “threshold”; body mapping with paint/collage; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants identify their current state and set creative intentions for the series. Session 2 – Trials & Allies: Shadows and Strengths Theme: Meeting obstacles and discovering resources. Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight. Session 4 – Return with the Elixir: Integration & Wholeness Theme: Carrying creative insight back into everyday life. Practices: Movement exploration of “pathways of return”; creation of a triptych \\(Before / Crossing / Return\\); gallery walk and group witnessing; closing ritual with shared intentions. Outcome: Students integrate learning and leave with practical creative practices for ongoing self- discovery and stress relief. Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop greater self-awareness by exploring personal experiences through movement, art-making, and reflective writing. 2. Use creative tools for well-being, including techniques for emotional expression, personal renewal, and stress reduction. 3. Strengthen confidence and connection through supportive group activities and experiments with expressive movement and visual art.",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how \"Be not afraid\" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation, and how even in the midst of troubles, both public and personal, we can help each other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both our own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will focus on experiences of fear, courage, consolation, and resilience in the historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nMarilyn McEntyre, writer and longtime professor of literature, coaches writers and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley, Western Theological Seminary and the Oblate School of Theology. Her books include Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies, When Poets Pray, and Speaking Peace in a Climate of Conflict. A new book about writing, Start With a Word, is coming out in February 2026 and can be pre-ordered at eerdmans.com. See more, and contact her, at marilynmcentyre.com.\n\nCost: $295-$695 depending on choices about lodging/commuting\n\nPartial scholarships available \n\nRegister at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/be-not-afraid",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

In this presentation, Firuze shares her creative process of transforming whale songs, spectrograms, and real marine research into vibrant visual art. Through the true stories of individual whales and the scientific discoveries behind her pieces, she explores how storytelling can spark emotional connection and drive conservation action. This talk invites audiences to listen more deeply to the ocean, understand the lives of the whales who inhabit it, and discover the power of art as a voice for the natural world.\n\nFiruze Gokce reached a significant milestone with the debut of her first solo art exhibition on May 23rd, showcasing her \"Whale Sounds on a Canvas\" collection. This exhibition featured her prints and immersive videos that blended visual art with the auditory experience of whale songs, offering a multi-sensory exploration of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally, her piece \"Brave Little Hunter\" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island, highlighting her ability to convey the emotional depth of the natural world. Firuze was also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in October 2024, further solidifying her place in the art community. Her artwork “Diving into the Depths of the Ocean” received an “Honorary Mention Award” from the Marine Society of Artists.\n\nGuests are welcome to arrive early and enjoy Firuze Gokce’s art exhibit, Whale Sounds on a Canvas II, currently on view at the Laguna Environmental Center from January 10 – April 24, 2026.",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts.

With instructor Dan, students will learn handbuilding methods to coil and pitch their vessels. With specific direction in learning the techniques to build any size of pot, from a large scale vessel to a small cup. We will learn how to support scaling up our forms through drying methods, interior ‘bone’ structure, and mastering directionality with our hands. There will be a focus on how we each make a mark upon a pot, and how to do so with purpose. Each student will create work that reflects the time-honored nature of handbuilding; when intention is given to the silhouette of a form, the lip of a cup, and/or the comfort of a handle. Each class will involve a warmup, a demo, and worktime. Most classes will have \\(fun&thoughtful\\) homework.\n\nRequired Class Supply List\n\nYou can view the requires class supply list here.\n\nLocation\n\nRoom 117, Ceramics Studio",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

I’ve got big emotions right now & I need a place to put them. This project will help me with that & maybe it will help you too. Join us…let’s do this as a community.

We are planning to partner with Indivisible Sonoma County to host a celebration of the finished quilt on 4th of July weekend at a public event (location TBA)!\n\nThe first hour: Learn about the quilt project, brainstorm ideas for your quilt panel and get started on a design.\n\nStay for another hour for studio time to continue working on the design for your quilt square and collaborate on this hopeful grass-roots project!\n\nSome fabric and pattern materials provided to get you started.\n\nLearn more about this FREE project at:\n\nhttps://www.wethepeoplequilt.org",

We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand-up comedy nights with one of the best standup comedians in town (in our opinion, in other people’s opinions, and soon, in your opinion too): Steve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Either way, Steve is back. He’s our main man, living-room ringmaster, and the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an MC for friends’ bands, which eventually led to his first stand-up set - a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants Pass, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead, he embraced the stage as a place for brutally honest, painfully awkward life confessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy, or very, very funny comedy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup - a proud Midwesterner now living in California, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite at The Punchline San Francisco, Cobb’s, San Jose Improv, Rooster T. Feathers, and Don’t Tell Comedy, and performs regularly at clubs and festivals across California and beyond. If sharp, witty, and hilarious is your vibe, Jalisa’s got you covered.\n\nAnd then there’s Ronn Vigh - our headliner. Ronn has written for *Fashion Police* on E! Television and performs stand-up at clubs, colleges, and venues across the country. He still dreams of becoming a weatherman (we support the dream). In the meantime, he’s an avid yogi (when not hungover), a devoted *Golden Girls* fan, and - despite being gay - a lifelong football lover.",

    "description": "Bluegrass, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm, John Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seamlessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time music for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year, with seven acclaimed albums and two Juno nominations, the Jaybirds are simultaneously innovative and unadorned, sophisticated and stripped-down, happily old-fashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance, $40 at the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelchair accessible. Art gallery open during intermission, refreshments for sale.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman \"one of the world's undisputed masters\" of the mandolin, famed for outstanding tone and taste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular favourites for sessions and covers, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded on many other projects, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music with highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller; the duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bluegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary \"new acoustic\" quartet, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit, renowned for highly skilled instrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed the Jaybirds. Of their latest album, Folk Radio UK said \"On That Other Green Shore showcases an accomplished, experienced band at the peak of their powers, with musicianship of the very highest order.\" Peghead Nation called it \"one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017.\" Los Angeles, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 2017. The veteran performer has played with, among others, Doc Watson, Richard Greene, John Jorgensen, Peter Rowan, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty. He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions by Laurie Lewis, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Daylighting the Creek as \"a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the glory days of early bluegrass guitar.\" Chilliwack, BC-based Trisha Gagnon is portrayed by Sing Out! as \"one of the most versatile\" and \"irresistible\" lead vocalists in bluegrass, her strong and distinctive style ranging from \"mournful and plaintive\" to \"hopeful and yearning.\" Trisha anchors what Dirty Linen magazine calls \"gorgeous three-part harmonies.\" She's also known for songwriting, dating back to her early days with the award-winning B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gill and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his own voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contemporary banjo players. \"Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingling,\" said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\), was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015, and Nick is a composer who also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley Station on the new Jaybird album \"showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense of melody,\" said Green Man Review. Spokane, WA-based Greg Spatz is hailed as a \"world-class bluegrass fiddler\" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Audition says Greg's \"virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after time,\" while Bluegrass Unlimited says he \"lays down some seriously fine bluegrass fiddle\" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast, where he's played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield, resophonic guitar master Rob Ickes, and many others including Laurie Lewis, Bryan Bowers, and Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squirrel, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with his wife called All Along the Sea, and is an award-winning",

Everyone welcome.\n\n**Speaking Horse Class** is offered by Heart & Mind Equine Horse Rescue. This began as our volunteer class and has expanded to serve the larger community. A chance to meet our rescued therapy horses, check out our volunteer program, and learn some holistic horse keeping and equine assisted services (e.g. therapy, coaching, leadership, and teambuilding with horses). NO experience necessary, and both horse and mental health professionals are welcome--truly all are welcome (9+ years old.)\n\nCurious about Equine Assisted Psychotherapy? Speaking Horse is not therapy, but it is an opportunity to get a \"taste\" of EAP because we use some of the same tools and exercises in both settings. So come out out and meet the herd (both humans and horses) connected with Friendly Trails and Heart & Mind Equine.\n\nEach month the class is centered on a holistic horse keeping theme, equine assisted learning, understanding herd dynamics, holistic horse care and training, or how they all relate to our human journey. FEBRUARY THEME: Year of the Fire Horse As the Lunar New Year is in February, we will borrow the theme of the passing Year of the Snake, shedding what is old and no longer needed and embracing the power and majesty of the horse. This time of year also coincides with the horses literally shedding (plan to be covered in horse hair as we groom them.) We will explore how the herd's ecosystem changes as they experience spring and the lessons we can learn from them.\n\nHorse lovers, highly sensitive people, mental health providers, parents, and teachers might especially benefit from this class as well as horse owners/riders who hope to improve their relationships with their equine partners. (Though this work is great for dogs as well, your dogs are not welcome at our horse rescue due to liability and distraction concerns.) Newcomers and novices are most welcome.\n\nCome and experience the magic of working with horses firsthand. Get ready to roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty, and connect with these majestic creatures. Whether you're a seasoned equestrian or just starting out, there's something for everyone at our Speaking Horse classes. Don't miss out on this exciting chance to bond with horses and fellow horse lovers. We can't wait to see you there!",

Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

She utilizes color,\nshape and texture on fine quality paper, each card uniquely handmade. Jan’s home in Sebastopol is her studio: the dining room table is her workshop, the kitchen cupboards storing boxes and trays of flowers. She buy card stock by the thousand and pick blooms from her garden and other public places.

Whether attending with a dad, grandfather, uncle, mentor, or family friend, participants experience a night centered on strengthening relationships and creating joyful moments.\n\nThe event has grown into one of the community’s most anticipated gatherings, known for delivering a memorable and engaging experience for all guests. Highlights of the evening include professional DJs, treat boxes for attendees, a flower presentation for every girl, raffle prize drawings throughout the night, and a souvenir photos for every guest.\n\nEvery dollar raised through the Kelseyville Father Daughter Dance is reinvested directly into funding the event. In select years, proceeds have also supported high school scholarships benefiting girls who have participated in the dance. The event is made possible through the dedication of adult volunteers who generously donate their time and efforts.\n\n“Our goal has always been to create a magical, meaningful experience for families,” organizers shared. “Seeing generations of attendees continue this tradition is what makes the event truly special.”\n\nAs the dance continues its long standing legacy, organizers look forward to welcoming both returning families and first time participants to celebrate another year of this treasured Kelseyville event.",

The word collage comes from the French verb coller, meaning \"to glue,\" and is all about merging various materials to tell a visual story. Much like our lives, which are shaped by countless moments and experiences, collage pieces bring together fragments that reveal hidden connections and untold narratives. In this class, you’ll reflect on what matters most to you and how that can be expressed through art. Catherine will help you release the need for perfection and trust your creative instincts. By the end of the workshop, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but also a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for the art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your personal story in your art, Methods for sourcing interesting collage papers, Techniques for crafting textured, multi-layered collages, Strategies for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life, copies of photos, old letters, books, papers from memorable experiences or travels, or documents that hold meaning. If you’re not comfortable using these documents, you should make color copies of them. For this process, it is also best to make laser copies of your photographs.Supplies provided by instructor: some collage papers, acrylic medium, brushesCLICK HERE TO READ DOCUMENT PRIOR TO PURCHASING CLASSAbout the instructor: Catherine Cruz is a French-American artist whose work is informed by the textures and patterns created by the passing of time and the effects of the natural elements on the built environment.

She works from her home studio in Sebastopol, CA, and participates in Art Trails Open Studios.

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own.

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA",

Barbara Postel is descended from Mennonites who lived in southern Ukraine. The members of her family and community who did not leave just before World War I were devastated by waves of repression, exile, and famine. For Barbara, Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine was deeply personal. In 2024, when she discovered there was humble volunteer work to be done in Lviv, she immediately took the opportunity to go and help. Barbara volunteers with Lviv Volunteer Kitchen and the Lviv New Acropolis Cultural Center Camouflage Net Project. She fundraises in support of the Camouflage Net Project.\n\n​This event is free and open to all. \n\nLearn more at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/beacon-of-light-ukraine",

    "description": "American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars, but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity and consistently delivering heartfelt, fashion-resistant music that their fans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa, California, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup were vocalist Mark Tate, guitarist Jim Cassero, bassist Jeff Barnacle, and drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same year when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf night club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest, longest-lasting, most important metal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles and being included on several important metal compilations, Vicious Rumors signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Records, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Varney. By this time, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vacated by Perkins; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for ten years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar, and bassist Dave Starr replaced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut, Soldiers of the Night, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European response. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly after Moomy's departure, but the virtuoso didn't stay long, as he was anxious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind Moore, St. Pierre was also sent packing, and the classic Digital Dictator Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert, guitarists Thorpe and Mark McGee, bassist Starr, and drummer Howe. This group would stay together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up, Digital Dictator, was released in 1988, and as the band's popularity began to grow domestically, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut for the label followed in 1990, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extensive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act, it appeared at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into the spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward trend continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang on: Live in Tokyo, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese tour. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe, the group was released from their contract with Atlantic, perhaps due not only to the band's relative inactivity, but also to the declining stateside popularity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record deals followed, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on through the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next release, Something Burning, Carl Albert died on April 22, 1995. The band decided to continue on, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally released in 1996, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by filling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European base as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-Christ While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent, the guitarist couldn't approach Albert's dexterity, and a new vocalist was needed in order for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Brian O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn, who appears on the 2001 release Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's release, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their ninth studio long-player, Warball, which saw them returning to the more traditional, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings. The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers, 2013's Electric Punishment, and 2016's Concussion Protocol.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

This event is free, but we appreciate your RSVP below so we can plan for your attendance. ABOUT BUNNY AND CLYDE ON THE LAM Learn the basics of fungal biology, foraging, and identification in this in-depth illustrated introduction from the beloved scientist, mushroom enthusiast, and social media star behind Fascinated By Fungi. In Dr. Fun Guy’s Passport to Kingdom Fungi, Dr. Gordon Walker brings his scientific knowledge and love for everything fungi to the page. The first section of this book is written in a comprehensive question-and-answer format. Starting with “What are fungi?,” you’ll learn about everything from what mycelium is and fungi’s evolution and biochemistry to how they are classified and how they impact our world today. You will also find information on best foraging practices and culinary techniques. The second half of this book introduces you to mushroom identification skills and profiles various mushrooms and other fungi, from incredible edibles you can find in the wild to the dangerously toxic, medicinal, and just plain weird. Finally, you’ll find fungal phenomena, showing the amazing breadth and diversity of the fungal kingdom. With colorful and comprehensive science illustrations, mushroom photography, and QR codes linking to resources to help you continue your fungal explorations, this is the perfect portal to step through into the world of mushrooms. “Gordon Walker’s book is fun, yes, and richly illustrated, but at the same time it’s an impressively detailed survey of the fungal kingdom and its fascinating denizens, mushrooms and molds, yeasts, and more.”—Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking and Nose Dive “Gordon Walker’s enthusiasm on the pages \\(and in person\\) is contagious, and he’s a great evangelizer for popular mycology.”—Britt A. Bunyard, PhD, publisher of Fungi Magazine and author of Lives of the Fungi ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dr. Gordon Walker is an award-winning speaker, science communicator, published author, and social media star \\(@fascinatedbyfungi \\) with over 3 million cumulative followers.  He has a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from UC Davis where his research focused on the microbial ecology of wine fermentations, bioprocess control, and yeast genetics. He is a passionate advocate for mushrooms, fungal conservation, and environmental sustainability.  His new book \"Passport to Kingdom Fungi\" will fundamentally transform the way people learn about mushrooms and fungi, serving as the go to resource for a whole new generation of mycophiles and people interested in foraging, wild foods, and fermentation.",

How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

If you find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring, you can sign up for the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Held at The Backdrop in Santa Rosa, the Summit will feature dynamic and informative speakers, and share the tools needed to create meaningful change in your community.\n\nWhat you can expect:\n\n● Hear more about the Housing for Healthy Communities Initiative.\n\n● Learn the practical steps associated with AB 1033, which allows the sale of\n\nADUs as separate homes through condoization—perfect for realtors, builders,\n\nlawyers, and bankers involved in ADU sales, development, and construction.\n\n● Gain powerful communication and advocacy skills to support more housing\n\n\\(transferable skills you can use in your work and advocacy roles outside of\n\nhousing, too!\\)\n\n● Build connections with others who care about housing & community action.\n\n﻿The Housing Action Summit is designed to help you turn urgency into impact and bring the changes we need for our community to thrive. The program will include a reception designed to encourage continued discussion and deeper engagement in the work Generation Housing is leading throughout the North Bay.\n\nRSVPs are open.\n\nTickets available on a sliding scale.\n\nVisit us online at www.generationhousing.org/news/ to reserve your seat",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

Bring a copy of your receipt at check-in to Painting/Drawing Studio adjacent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly, heart-centered gathering where we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of compassion, protection, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and echoed across many cultures, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and all who have passed, those in transition, and those in distress.This ongoing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war, with a special focus now on the approximately 19,000 children who have perished in Israel and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple, meditative act of working with clay, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public exhibits and peace sites, offering spaces for reflection, mourning, and hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each month at SebArts, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to ages 12 - adult, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.There is no fee for this class; donations are welcome to help cover materials and expenses. More than a class, this is a shared space of warmth and care—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

This Pop singer/songwriter has toured from coast to coast making waves all over the country. Michelle's 2021 single Come to Me has caught the attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued making music ever since.

You can learn more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n\"Michelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Whether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a confident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the stage before wielding her violin in classic rock goddess mode. Michelle Lambert is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!\"\n\n-Dennis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influences when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emotional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishes in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian",

    "description": "FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWhy Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stressed out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyond Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Made plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something still isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the right things” — in life, work, business, leadership, or creative endeavors — but feel stuck, stalled, or quietly frustrated underneath it all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But because there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when confidence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up responsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progress without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) through uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of real-world experience — not theory, hype, or hustle culture.\n\nEverything you’ll hear has been lived, tested, failed at, adjusted, and practiced in real careers, real leadership roles, and real life.\n\nWHAT THIS WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a practical, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in planning and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t come first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How small, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited to slow down, get honest, and reconnect with what actually matters right now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about what you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop waiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willingness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed sense of direction\n\n• One honest, doable next step forward\n\n• A practical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretending.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell is an Inspirational Author, Teacher, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Coach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experience.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(and its companion workbook\\), Morning Motivation, and Chill.\n\nHis work is grounded, practical, and focused on real change — without hype, dogma, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TAKE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready, this workshop opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals and changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.",

They have been great contributors and carriers of the lineage and yet have too often remained hidden beneath the surface of history. Their stories are fierce, resilient, and revolutionary. Do you know them?\n\nFrom the first Buddhist nuns who challenged the norms of their time, to modern-day teachers, mothers, activists, and visionaries reshaping spiritual life today, women have always been keystones to the continuation of the Dharma. This benefit event invites all genders to step into that legacy—to see, honor, and draw strength from the women who have shaped the Dharma with their courage and uncompromising truth.\n\nTogether with an inspiring group of contemporary Dharma teachers, we’ll explore these stories and ask: What guidance do these spiritual ancestors offer us now—when clarity, groundedness, and collective courage are so urgently needed?",

Beginning to advanced students welcome.\n\nDuring this workshop students will learn the importance of good art materials, brushes, paints, and paper. Composition/cropping: Understanding form and light source. How to transfer designs to watercolor paper. Techniques and tricks with masking fluid to obtain soft and crisp edges and textures.\n\nStudents will explore basic watercolor washes & glazing techniques for depth and luminosity (what paints play well with others). We will also explore techniques for creating texture with spraying, salt, thirsty brush, etc.\n\nEach student will be given two images of the piece to be painted, one color and one black and white for a value study. The image will be transferred to the watercolor paper using graphite paper, and masking fluid applied where needed. While the fluid dries we will explore painting simpler forms to practice graded washes and color combinations to be used in the final painting. Students will observe demos as we move through the painting and will receive one on one helpful guidance to gain skill and confidence!\n\nSusan Sweet is a local mixed media and watercolor artist whose work is inspired by nature.\n\nTo register, please contact Susan Sweet by email: mailto:susansweetartist@gmail.com mailto:susansweetartist@gmail.com mailto:susansweetartist@gmail.com susansweetartist@gmail.com mailto:susansweetartist@gmail.com mailto:susansweetartist@gmail.com or by phone (707) 367-0672.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Now in its 48th year, this iconic event brings together 50 wineries across Northern Sonoma County for a tasting experience focused entirely on the Past, Present, and Future of wine.\n\nBarrel Tasting is not a food-pairing or themed event-it's all about the wine and how it evolves over time. Taste a current vintage, compare it to the same wine still aging in the barrel, and savor the depth and complexity of select library wines. It's a rare opportunity to explore the winemaking journey side by side, straight from the source.\n\nMeet the winemakers, step into the cellar, and experience the heart and soul of Sonoma County winemaking up close. Come ready to taste, learn, and have fun-Barrel Tasting happens just once a year, and it's not to be missed.\n\nTicket Prices:\n\n$50 Weekend - This ticket is good for both Saturday and Sunday, there will not be a 1-day ticket option.\n\n$10 Designated Driver",

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typically painterly in effect, made by applying or painting ink to an historically, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to acrylic or a gel plate, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing processes, mono-printing creates one final image.  However, it is possible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final image - but it is its own image, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn this class, we will use the idea of experimenting, and using drawing, tracing, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  These found materials create all kinds of markings, shapes and images - as they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the stencils and create openings for more texture, shapes, and imagery to create layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling back the paper for the look, it is the surprise element that keeps me coming back to this process.  This process also works well with other printmaking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut into shapes and images, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images.  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing, they might even be considered poetic.",

    "description": "With more than 50 years of experience and five advanced degrees, Dr. Maria is known worldwide as a medical intuitive, channel, empath, teacher, and Lakota/Diné Traditional Elder.\n\nDuring this time of great upheaval in our world, and specifically in our country, the environments we live in and create for ourselves can have dramatic impacts on our cellular healing and processing. Dr. Maria Michael will talk about how climate change, social justice and our environments impact our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. She will talk about the importance of self care, focusing on the most impacted organs, how to recognize what is needed, and ways in which to support yourself, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally. She will focus on herbal medicine and other somatic and ancient methods to support the immune system. There will be time for an open dialogue with the audience and to answer questions. What makes this evening especially powerful is that it takes place within the amplified bioenergetic field of the EESystem. As Dr. Maria speaks about cellular resonance, coherence, and restoring balance, guests will simultaneously be immersed in a scalar-energy environment designed to support optimal cellular communication and energetic harmony. The experience becomes more than a lecture — it becomes embodied learning.\n\nThis event offers a welcoming introduction to Dr. Maria’s work. For those who feel called to go deeper, Dr Maria will hold on March 15th a group healing circle ceremony/workshop. It is a guided interactive process, in which each participant will experience a variety of techniques using light, sound, touch, energy and ancient wisdom healing techniques. Whether you are new to her work or already familiar with energy-based healing, this evening is an invitation to explore what becomes possible when wisdom, frequency, and intention align. We look forward to welcoming you into the field.\n\nAbout Dr Maria Michael\n\nDr. Maria D. Michael is a world renowned and respected medical intuitive, channel, empath, healer, psychic and teacher for over 40 years. She has been awarded 5 advanced degrees \\(all Summa Cum Laude\\), including a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. She has doctorate-level training in Neuropsychology and Special Education and extensive post-doctoral studies in Psychoanalysis and Jungian Psychology. Additionally, Dr. Michael is trained and experienced in EMDR, Hypnotherapy, LENS Neurofeedback, Neurolinguistic Programming, Eriksonian Hypnosis Training. She is a Lakota/Diné \\(Navajo\\) Traditional elder, has participated in and led traditional Native ceremonies and doctored alongside Lakota Medicine people. She has been sought out worldwide for her powerful Medicine Energies and Healing abilities.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nDr. Maria Michael believes that we all come from the same Creation, and that everyone has the potential and capacity to communicate with Creation. While the Lakota call Creation “The Great Mystery,” other traditions may refer to Creation, with names such as, “God,” “the Universe,” “Allah,” “Yahweh,” “Divine Love,” “Universal Love” or “Cosmic Consciousness.”\n\nWe not only choose our human families, but also we choose, initially at least, our own unique form or tradition of understanding and communication with the Great Mystery. No form or tradition is better than another. Humans are merely attempting to understand “That” which is beyond comprehension.\n\nAll messages from the Great Mystery are compassionate and loving, even though at times these messages may appear difficult. Creation’s message appears to us in whatever way we choose to comprehend it. Sometimes, we are only capable of comprehending deeply sensitive messages that resound in our hearts, and sometimes only strong and “seemingly” shocking messages penetrate our defenses. This loving Spirit guides us to remove those obstacles that stand in our way of becoming all that Creation and We intended us to be.",

All Seats  $25 Hailing from Croatia, Brazil, Seattle and New York City, USA, the Astrid Kuljanic Transatlantic Exploration Company unites four musical worlds, bound by a shared dedication and curiosity for music. Astrid’s instinct for exploration brought her to New York, where she quickly became immersed in musical communities from India and Brazil, Klezmer music, avant-garde improvisation, and electronic experimentation.  She carefully drew from these circles her new band members: accordionist Benjamin Rosenblum, bassist Mat Muntz and percussionist Rogerio Boccato. The band developed a strong connection through regular performances of Astrid’s original music, arrangements of jazz and Brazilian standards, and traditional and popular songs from Eastern Europe.  Performance highlights include The Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., Gramercy Theatre and Waldorf Astoria in New York City, and each performance is charged with interactive improvisation and rhythmic intensity.  The band celebrated their first album – an energetic set of music with rolling momentum – with a sold out concert release party at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.",

The Bay Area sextet is thrilled to bring their signature sound back to the iconic venue. Music begins at **7:30 pm**, with dinner reservations available from **6 pm to 8 pm**.\n\nWreckless Strangers return to their roots with their forthcoming studio album, ***Dirty Souls***. The six-song collection marks the band’s most raw and visceral effort to date — a modern take on the arena rock of the 1970s and ’80s that inspired their earliest musical influences.\n\nThe songwriting is among their most intimate and personal, exploring themes of relationships, loss, empowerment, and perseverance. Co-lead singers **Amber Morris** and **David Noble** function as a single organism, bringing the songs to life with bluesy grit, soul, and humanity bolstered by rock-solid, road-hewn grooves. \n\n***Dirty Souls*** is the band’s third studio outing under the tutelage of Grammy-winning producer **Dave Way**, who fosters a level of depth and organic cohesion that firmly establishes Wreckless Strangers in San Francisco’s storied rock ‘n’ roll legacy.  The first single, \"Dirty Soul,\" came out on January 23 and is available on all streaming platforms. The full album comes out in late March, but concert attendees will have the exclusive opportunity to purchase advance copies of the CD. Review copies are available now, upon request.\n\nVisit **WrecklessStrangers.com** and follow the band on social media for updates.",

Drawing from Forest Buddhist teachings and earth-based awareness, we will cultivate a peace that does not depend on conditions. A peace that arises from being fully present, embodied, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditation, and periods of silence, we will explore the body as part of the living earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than striving for calm, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds us—moment by moment, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to slow down, listen deeply, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace within our own hearts.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typically painterly in effect, made by applying or painting ink to an historically, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to acrylic or a gel plate, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing processes, mono-printing creates one final image.  However, it is possible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final image - but it is its own image, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn this class, we will use the idea of experimenting, and using drawing, tracing, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  These found materials create all kinds of markings, shapes and images - as they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the stencils and create openings for more texture, shapes, and imagery to create layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling back the paper for the look, it is the surprise element that keeps me coming back to this process.  This process also works well with other printmaking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut into shapes and images, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images.  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing, they might even be considered poetic.",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA",

Join us for an afternoon of mystery and storytelling with Jazzmyn, accompanied by middle eastern food and fine wines available for purchase. Settle in and be transported! Free admission, all donations happily accepted.   She writes \"I am nine years old living in Damacus, Syria. My father is on a diplomatic assignment with the United Nations to ease tensions on the volatile border between Jordan and Israel. We are transferred from Damacus, Syria, to Jerusalem, Jordan in late 1955. I came to know and love my Bedouin neighbors. They kindly lend me their only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in the Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beautiful, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and generous neighbors. Ten years ago, I picked up volume number one of \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night\" translated by Sir Richard Francis Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of every young, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volumes of \"Shah Razad\" i felt compelled to continue this extraordinary tradition of storytelling, intended to transmit moral values, by adding my own story: Shah Razad...and the Djinns Who Loved Her.",

The band will debut a new song, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee, available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Society that day. According to Kurt Neumann, the song is a reflection of “Where you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sense of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away and coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is founded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned them an exuberant, loyal, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid 80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages throughout the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The band has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller, and Bruce Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train, Chris Isaak, Warren Zevon, Joan Osbourne, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Perhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and major festival, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest shows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things,” “You Don’t Get Much,” “Idaho,” “If It Makes You,”“Stay,”“All The World,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternative sound has achieved many milestones, including a Rolling Stone Reader’s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987, support slots with U2, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Tom Petty, George Thorogood, The Pretenders, David Bowie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid, Summerfest, ACL Festival and others, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live,” “Letterman,” “Today,” “Imus,” CNN, and ESPN, to name a few. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original series, The Ranch, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent installation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part of their Midwest Artists exhibit.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor: Judith Redwing Keyssar, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator, end-of-life doula, author, poet, song-writer, ceremonialist, national presenter and frequent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. Redwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Education in Palliative Care at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Her professional career includes being the Clinical Director at Zen Hospice Project and the Director of Palliative Care and Nursing at Jewish Family and Children’s Services from 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California State University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care, and has taught courses at OLLI at Sonoma State. Redwing is the author of an award-winning book, “Last Acts of Kindness; Lessons for the Living from the Bedsides of the Dying” and is the recipient of numerous awards in the field of Palliative Care. After studying with John Fox at the Institute for Poetic Medicine, her passion for using poetry as a healing modality has led to the development of a successful international program in Poetic Medicine, through her work at the UCSF MERI Center.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

    "description": "Each month, the Poetry Book Club meets online to discuss one must-read book of poems, whether a timeless classic or an award-winning contemporary. Led by Napa poet Kathleen Patterson, who has been an enthusiastic book club member since its beginning, meetings are open to all levels of poetry readers, both the curious and the committed. ABOUT THE BOOK WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection, My Infinity, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poems investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and emotional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of this collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hilma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction, her radical work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly, Jackson's poems explore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont, where perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a book that questions all that is endless, all that has been thought as limiting, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an American poet and professor. In 2020, she released her debut poetry collection, Moon Jar, and in 2024, she released another titled My Infinity, both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vanderbilt University",

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

    "description": "The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Library and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuses on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event, but we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look forward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK \\#1 New York Times best seller! Booklist Editors’ Choice 2015 - Youth! Named a \"Best Book of 2015\" by Time Magazine, School Library Journal, Barnes & Noble, NPR, PopSugar, The Millions, and The News & Observer! Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen. That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he's probably right. Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here--it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters. \"Rowell imbues her magic with awe and spectacle. It's a powerful, politically minded allegory about sexual, ethnic and class identity - with a heady shot of teenage lust.\" —New York Times Book Review \"It’s a brilliantly addictive, genuinely romantic story about teenagers who can’t be neatly sorted into houses, coping with stress and loss and the confusion of just trying to be who they are. It’s as if Rowell turned the Harry Potter books inside out, and is showing us the marvelous, subversive stuffing inside.\" —Time Magazine \"Full of heart and humor, this fantastical tale is a worthy addition to the wizarding-school genre.\" —People Magazine ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rainbow Rowell is the award-winning \\#1 New York Times bestselling author of Eleanor & Park and the Simon Snow Trilogy, plus several other novels, short stories, and comics. She lives in Omaha, Nebraska, just like most of her characters.",

    "description": "Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of legacy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group, meeting to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous, or not-so-famous\\) poets of the past & present who have left a mark on literature, the art of poetry, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male, female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & erotic, political, pastoral & personal, dreamers, ragers, firebrands, sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize, and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interested poets & potential participants, the library will publish this growing list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review, with a short bio & picture, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poets listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from participants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wednesday of each month, we will gather for a round-table review of several poets, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to explore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meeting to read about their chosen poet, explore one or more biographies & several poems, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gathering. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems, then we will open a discussion among the participants, after which that participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant will then read a chosen poem, followed by a discussion, as well as his or her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present, each segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei Codrescu Anna Akmatova Cesar Vallejo Dylan Thomas E.E. Cummings Elizabeth Bishop Emerald GoingSnake Federico Garcia Lorca Hannah Arendt Jalal al-Din Rumi Jessie Lamont Jesus Papoleto Melendez Joy Harjo John Berryman Kahlil Gibran Shams Hafez Katrine O Jensen Langston Hughes Maria Stepanova Mary Oliver May Sarton May Swenson Maya Angelou Omar Khayyam Pablo Neruda Silvia Plath Wallace Stevens Vaclev Pavel V.

If you've ever had a curiosity about archery, this is your chance to find out more with a fun, interactive lesson.\n\nWe have reserved a special event with the indoor range on a Wednesday evening. It will consist of a basic lesson, and then we all get to practice shooting. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment is provided by them, and we will probably get about an hour or hour and a half to practice.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy). Closed toe shoes recommended.\n\nThere are 17 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event in addition to the regular fee so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of the event. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!",

Each session will start with a demonstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces that might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are freeform coil pots, soft slab work, hard slab technique, a variety of sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping, carving and textural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips and glaze that will add color to the forms we create.About the Instructor: Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After his college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick, he ran a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Turkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-12 art, including Ceramics, Drawing, Photography, Design and Sculpture at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High School and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of these schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teachers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the experimental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help students explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

This juried exhibition looks beyond nostalgia to examine how familiar symbols, stories, and styles evolve over time&mdash;bridging the past and present through creativity and craft. \n\n&ldquo;Americana&rdquo; has long served as a reflection of everyday life and culture, from small-town iconography and handmade crafts to design movements and popular imagery. In Americana Reimagined artists reexamine this broad theme, juxtaposing the old and the new, and honoring timeless motifs while offering fresh perspectives on what they mean today.\n\nJurors \n\nDonna Seager, Donna Seager Fine Arts &amp; Artists' Books  Richard Neill, Multimedia Artist and Film curator Simon Corwin, Petaluma Artist and Jewelry\n\nStates of Anxiety, States of HopeExhibition Dates: March 12 - April 18, 2026Opening Reception: Thursday, March 12, 5:30-7:30pm\n\nAbout States of Anxiety, States of Hope: This exhibition presents a selection of works by artist Inez Storer that reflect on the emotional, cultural, and political complexities of contemporary life. Building on themes explored in Americana Reimagined, Storer's paintings offer a layered meditation on identity, memory, and collective experience in times of uncertainty and transformation.\n\nThrough her distinctive magical realist collage method, Storer constructs richly textured visual narratives that merge personal history with broader social realities. Her works are composed of fragments&mdash;symbols, images, and artifacts drawn from her life and interests.\n\nStorer's paintings guide the viewer on a journey through both historical memory and internal landscapes. They balance darkness and light, anxiety and hope.  She asks us to reflect on the conditions of our moment. States of Anxiety, States of Hope affirms art's capacity to illuminate struggle while nurturing resilience, empathy, and connection.",

Every second Thursday of the month, this Tiburon-based troubadour settles into the warmly lit corner of Novato's beloved neighborhood pub and does what he does best: connects. An accomplished guitarist and award-winning songwriter, Lamboy has earned his stripes across the Bay Area scene both as a solo artist and as frontman of Pacific Standard, his soulful Americana band. His five acclaimed albums draw praise for melodies that are pitch-perfect and lyrics that feel like they were written specifically for you. At Finnegan's, a lively Irish pub and American bar and grill along a tree-lined street in downtown Novato, Lamboy's intimate style is perfectly at home. No pretense. No distance. Just a strong clear voice, commanding guitar, and songs that, as one critic put it, lift you above the everyday. Come early, grab a pint, and let the music find you. https://greglamboy.com/\n\n*Every second Thursday of the month | Finnegan's Marin, 877 Grant Ave, Novato | Free*",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

There will be a focus on how we each make a mark upon a pot, and how to do so with purpose. Each student will create work that reflects the time-honored nature of handbuilding; when intention is given to the silhouette of a form, the lip of a cup, and/or the comfort of a handle. Each class will involve a warmup, a demo, and worktime. Most classes will have \\(fun&thoughtful\\) homework.\n\nRequired Class Supply List\n\nYou can view the requires class supply list here.\n\nLocation\n\nRoom 117, Ceramics Studio",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

Papadakis joins 2-time United States Champion Alissa Czisny and skating artist Rohene Ward in a company of ten world class skaters. From the opening movement they shape formations that move through four acts; each sharing a story that takes the audience on a journey.\n\nTHE SEASONS bursts with color, emotion, and momentum.  Ice Dance International company members launch daring lifts and jumps, crisp footwork, and seamless transitions that thrilled audiences on IDI's 2025 tour.\n\nPapadakis, Czisny and Ward's presence elevates every phrase&mdash;their power, musical instinct, and magnetic connection ignite the audience and sharpen the edge of every moment. This is skating unbound: athletic, cinematic, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 2026, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance dance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo;THE SEASONS isn't just a show&mdash;it's a pulse, a spark, a reminder that when blades meet music and movement meets heart, the ice itself begins to sing.&rdquo; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be community events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI company. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/cross overs, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. Classes will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and advance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chance for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast members. It generally take the cast 25 minutes to finish a show, regroup and get to the meet and greet! There will be flyers and markers for signing.",

Just steps from the heart of the Vallejo Art Walk, this monthly series invites you to discover bold new sounds in a setting made for connection—where the lights are low, the cocktails are strong, and the music runs deep.\n\nCome early for the art, stay late for the music.

Speaker Bio: As California Program Manager for Wildlands Network, Mari develops collaborative and strategic partnerships to further policy, road ecology, and land use initiatives that promote wildlife corridors and core habitat protections throughout the State of California. Mari spent her childhood on a farm in the San Joaquin Valley of California and her summers in the Sierra Nevada, near Ebbetts Pass. Her outdoor exposure inspired her to earn her bachelor's degree in environmental science from Humboldt State University. After college, she rode her bike across the U.S. and lived off the grid in Hawaii before taking a job coordinating settlements at a personal injury law firm in downtown San Francisco to gain exposure to the practice of law. In 2017, she attended the University of Oregon and obtained her law degree in 2020 and became licensed to practice law in both Oregon and California the following year. Mari lives in the San Joaquin Valley. When not strategizing a connected California, you'll find her with her dog, Bodie, either backpacking, trail running, cooking, practicing piano, brewing beer, gardening, or sketching.",

What we do not yet understand shapes our view and obscures freedom. What are the processes by which we realize and align with our deepest knowing?\n\nTogether, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep attention, spiritual friendship, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matters in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experience of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and love.\n\nDuring this day of practice, we’ll offer guided and silent meditation practice, Dharma reflections, and time for dialogue. All are welcome.",

Make delicate gnudi, whipped ricotta crostini, and traditional torta di ricotta romana.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nDiscover the incredible versatility of ricotta cheese in this hands-on Italian cooking class featuring three distinct preparations that showcase this beloved ingredient. You’ll learn techniques ranging from delicate pasta-making to elegant appetizers and classic Italian desserts. Start by creating pillowy ricotta gnudi, those cloud-like dumplings that are lighter than traditional gnocchi, served with a vibrant tomato sauce. Master the art of achieving the perfect texture and learn how to handle the delicate dough for consistently beautiful results. Next, prepare whipped ricotta crostini topped with honey and fresh thyme, an elegant appetizer that balances creamy, sweet, and herbaceous flavors on crispy bread. Finally, you’ll bake torta di ricotta romana, a traditional Roman ricotta cake that’s subtly sweet and wonderfully moist. This classic dessert demonstrates how ricotta creates tender, delicate baked goods with authentic Italian character. Throughout the class, you’ll gain confidence working with fresh ricotta, understanding how its moisture content and handling affect each dish differently. Whether you’re looking to expand your Italian cooking repertoire or simply love ricotta, this class provides techniques and recipes you’ll return to again and again. Perfect for intermediate home cooks ready to explore authentic Italian preparations.Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Unlike traditional drumming, the Rav Vast creates a “sound forest” of overtones that helps the mind settle and the body soften. In this session, we integrate: Vibrational Sound Bath: The ethereal tones of the Rav Vast to lower your heart rate. Somatic Humming: To physically vibrate the vagus nerve from the inside out, syncing your breath with the drum. Flowing Qigong: Gentle, meditative movements to move “Qi” \\(energy\\) and release physical bracing in the body. Experience the shift from “survival mode” to “serenity.” Denise will guide you through: Qigong to open the body’s energy channels. Humming to stimulate your internal “calm” switch. A Rav Vast Sound Bath to wash away tension with beautiful, resonant harmonics. Come home to your body. Leave feeling grounded, peaceful, and renewed.\n\nAbout Denise Aubin, MQT\n\nDenise Aubin is a certified Medical Qigong Therapist \\(MQT\\) and the founder of Dance of Qigong.

Come brave the perilous waters of Point Reyes and join us for a rollicking good time at Point Reyes National Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Please bring your arsenal of sea chanteys, any musical instruments you'd like, and a willingness to laugh a lot!  It's so much fun when audience members lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus, and leading a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea chantey radio station and hear what's out there! Practice lyrics! Teach the chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal, mellow, and supportive, so if you've been wanting to push your comfort edge and lead a song, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather just singalong with the chantey choruses, that's fine too. We always have a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of all levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys, there may be lyrics that are not appropriate for children. Reservations not required.

Over the course of six months, filled with laughter, hilarious misadventures, and the occasional liquid refreshment, these middle-aged women successfully bond and find the confidence to jump start their new lives. Together, they discover lasting friendships and a renewed determination to live in the moment—and most importantly, realize it’s never too late to make new old friends.",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**",

Today, thanks to dedicated restoration efforts, it can once again be enjoyed by all who walk its trails.\n\nThe experience begins with an overview presented by Eric Metz, Director of Operations, who will share the history of the orchard and the challenges involved in its revival. From there, participants will hike through redwoods and mixed oak woodlands on a moderate, six-mile round-trip trek to the orchard.\n\n At the orchard, guests will tour the areas that have been thoughtfully revitalized and learn about unique obstacles overcome in restoring this landscape.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "with James Baraz, MA\n\nSpring is a natural time to reflect on what we are holding on to and what may be ready to be released. Just what does the phrase “let go” mean? Renunciation (*nekkhama* in Pāli), one of the ten perfections, is often misunderstood as sacrifice—something we should do because it’s “good for us.” In early Buddhist teachings, *nekkhama* is described not as deprivation, but as a letting go that supports genuine contentment and well-being, rooted in seeing more clearly what leads to suffering and what leads to freedom.\n\nDuring this daylong program, which includes periods of guided silent sitting and walking meditation, participants will explore how habitual grasping—to thoughts, personal stories, possessions, roles, and a sense of control—shapes inner experience and contributes to stress. Drawing from contemplative teachings and incorporating perspectives from psychology on attachment and habitual mental patterns, our reflections and practices will focus on meeting these patterns with awareness and kindness, loosening unhelpful self-stories, softening the impulse to control, and cultivating generosity. This program is educational in nature and welcomes both new and experienced practitioners.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared.

    "description": "In this 4 week course, participants will learn a unique approach to watercolor, intended to alleviate the frustration that many experience when learning this beautiful yet challenging medium. The class will focus on strengthening one’s observational skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step by step layering process, that trains the artist to see value and color\n\nOur subject matter will be flora and fauna - a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life. \n\nThis class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With 4 class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own. \n\nAll materials provided.\n\nLocation: Bohemian Flowers Farm, 121 Bohemian Hwy, Freestone, CA\n\nDates: Four Sundays - March 8, 15, 22, 29\n\nTime: 1 - 4 pm\n\nAges: Adults\n\nSkill Levels: All Levels",

Set in the not-so-distant future, the narrative centers on 85-year-old Marjorie, whose mind is gradually succumbing to dementia. To combat her fading recollections, her family introduces her to a “Prime”—a lifelike holographic projection of her late husband, Walter, programmed to retell the stories of their shared past. As Marjorie interacts with Walter Prime, the lines between authentic memories and reconstructed narratives blur, prompting profound questions about identity, the reliability of our recollections, and the extent to which technology can replicate the essence of human connection. This thought-provoking drama challenges audiences to consider what we choose to remember, what we wish to forget, and how the digital age reshapes the very fabric of our personal histories.**\n\n***Marjorie Prime* has garnered critical acclaim for its insightful exploration and profound commentary on the human condition in an era where technology increasingly intertwines with our daily lives.**\n\nThursdays, Fridays & Saturdays @ 7:30pm, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:00pm Run Time: One hour, 20 mins including intermission\n\nThursdays Adult $33 Fri/Sat Eve Adult $39.95; Senior $36.95; Under 18 $26.95 Sat/Sun Matinee Adult $47.95; Senior $44.95 \\*All prices include fees (707) 523-4185 **boxoffice@6thstreetplayhouse.com**",

Last summer, Barbosa premiered his second hour-long stand-up special, Ralph Barbosa: Planet Bosa, as part of Hulu’s new Hularious comedy brand. \nHis first hour-long stand-up special, Ralph Barbosa: Cowabunga, premiered on Netflix on October 31, 2023, and ranked as the #3 TV show on Netflix throughout its first week on the service. \nIn July 2024, Barbosa was selected as one of Variety’s 10 Comics to Watch for 2024 and toured theaters throughout North America, including two sold-out theater shows as part of the Netflix Is A Joke Fest 2024, as well as hosting the kick-off show. 2023 was Barbosa’s break-out year, during which he was a guest on The Joe Rogan Experience, made his debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and performed Comedy Central Stand-up Featuring: Ralph Barbosa, which topped 6 million views on YouTube. \nBarbosa also starred in the HBO Max comedy special, Entre Nos: The Winners 3 in 2022, and earlier that year his Don’t Tell Comedy performance was released on YouTube and now has over 6 million views. \n\n\nThis event will be a phone-free experience. Use of phones, smart watches, and accessories will not be permitted in the performance space. Upon arrival at the venue, all phones, smart watches, and accessories will be secured in individual Yondr pouches that will be opened at the end of the event. Guests maintain possession of their devices at all times, and can access them throughout the event only in designated Phone Use Areas within the venue. All devices will be re-secured in Yondr pouches before returning to the performance space. Anyone seen using a device (phone, smart watch or accessories) during the performance will be escorted out of the venue. More info here. \n\n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

    "description": "January 9–March 22, 2026\n\nStep into a wonderland of blooming miniature trees to marvel at the living art of bonsai and the season’s first flowers. Then stroll through our Asian Woodland to admire majestic magnolias, cherries, and camellias in bloom, or join a tour or program to explore this timeless craft.\n\nThis year’s all-new presentation by the skilled artisans of the Redwood Empire Bonsai Society \\(REBS\\) highlights the grace and vitality of flowering bonsai—trees and shrubs trained to bloom in exquisite proportion to their diminutive scale. Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40. Materials fees are not discounted.\n\nBecome a member today and find community, connection, and creativity.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artist, Tosya Shore, presents Celebrating Women, paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air, a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net \n\nFor further information: Contact: Beverly Bird, Press Contact, at bvdrio@sonic.net or 707-799-1490.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

    "description": "There’s something about Marty O’Reilly’s music that feels like it’s always been here—like an old story being told in a new way. His voice is raw and real, his guitar playing gritty and soulful. It’s music that doesn’t try to be anything other than honest, and that’s exactly why it hits so hard.\n\nHe pulls inspiration from the roots of Americana; his sound references folk greats like Woody Guthrie, blues legends like Howlin’ Wolf,  gospel pioneers like Sister Rosetta Thorpe, and master storytellers like Tom Waits. It’s a sound that captivates and connects audiences, and leaves them wanting more.\n\nHis live shows aren’t just concerts—they’re cathartic experiences. One moment it’s soft and haunting, the next it’s wild and electric. The kind that stay with you long after the lights come up.\n\nBut it’s not just about the sound. Marty’s songs dig deep into the human experience—loneliness, connection, love, loss. Whether it’s an intimate solo set or a full band show, he makes every audience feel like they’re part of the story.\n\nOver the years, Marty has built a dedicated following through relentless touring and staying true to his craft. He’s shared the stage with artists like Shakey Graves, St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Sarah Jarosz, and Alice O’Donovan and played at festivals like Bottlerock, SXSW, and High Sierra Music Festival, but his focus has always been on making music that means something.\n\nMarty has poured everything into his music—spending years on the road, self-funding his albums, and navigating the ups and downs of life as an independent artist, husband, and father. But through it all, he’s never lost sight of why he started: to make honest music that connects.\n\nIf you’re looking for music that feels real, that makes you stop and listen, Marty O’Reilly is someone you need to hear.",

Visitors can expect to see original works in acrylic, oil, pastel, watercolor, fiber art, and photography, many of which will be available for purchase. The exhibition highlights the wide range of styles, techniques, and personal visions represented by Oakmont’s artists, making each year’s show a fresh and inspiring experience.\n\nIn addition to fine art, the show will include a lively Artisan Marketplace. Artisans will offer an array of handcrafted items, including jewelry, photography, assemblage art, fiber and fabric pieces, original books, pottery, fused glass, and many other unique small works. These one-of-a-kind creations make perfect gifts and provide an opportunity to support local artists directly.\n\nThe event is designed to be both engaging and festive. Attendees can enjoy live music by Oakmont musicians and appetizers while browsing the exhibits and visiting with artists. A popular highlight of the show is the annual raffle, which adds an extra element of excitement while supporting a meaningful cause. In 2025 more than 50 raffle prizes were generously donated by local businesses.  Raffle drawing and wine reception occurs at 3:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nProceeds from the raffle benefit Art Quest, an organization that supports Santa Rosa students who are pursuing education and careers in the arts. The generosity of past attendees has made a real impact—the 2025 raffle raised $3,200 for Art Quest, helping to foster creativity and opportunity for young artists in our region.\n\nThe Oakmont Art Association invites the community to attend this special event, celebrate 52 years of creativity, and experience the imagination, skill, and passion of its artists.",

We will focus on strengthening one’s observational drawing skills, giving the artist a foundation off of which to build their paintings in a step-by-step layering process that trains the artist to see value and color. Our subject matter will be flora and fauna – a sampling of plants and animals. These subjects are great for beginners and experienced artists alike; their organic shapes make them forgiving drawing subjects, but their beauty can be a muse for life.  Instructor Hannah Day is a passionate nature lover and watercolorist and will share her unique approach to rendering botanicals and animal portraits in watercolor. This class will work both from photographs and from life, practicing observational drawing in addition to watercolor technique. With six class sessions, participants will have the opportunity to develop their skills and build muscle memory with a medium that often feels like it has a mind of its own.  This class is open to artists of all skill levels. All materials are provided.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artist, Tosya Shore, presents Celebrating Women, paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air, a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net \n\nFor further information: Contact: Beverly Bird, Press Contact, at bvdrio@sonic.net or 707-799-1490.",

    "description": "with Pawan Bareja, PhD\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nWine Cork Art\n\nSAVE YOUR CORKS LADIES!\n\nWe are hosting a special event in March, on Saturday the 21st at our old favorite, K Squared Cellars. Local artist Tara Dickinson will be leading us as a group through creating a cork board masterpiece.\n\nEvent fee ($45) includes artist instruction and your personal cork art piece, invite your friends to join us! Please bring all those corks you have saved and don't quite know what to do with. If you don't have any, that's fine too. Let us know in the comments section so we can bring extra.\n\nVino is made available by K Squared for a separate fee *(by the flight or glass)*. The owner, Andrew, will be on hand to serve wine and entertainment.\n\nAbout the Cellars: After spending his first 9 years in the wine industry at Charles Krug Winery in St. Helena, Andrew Moore developed a passion for crafting small lot, premium wines. In 2010, with a \"the wine glass is half full\" type of attitude, Andrew's plans for owning his own winery began with a single barrel of Russian River Pinot Noir produced at home.\n\nIn 2015 K Squared Cellars acquired winery and tasting room space. That single barrel of Pinot Noir and a dream of having their own family winery was realized!\n\nAbout the Artist: Tara Dickinson is our artist and instructor. She has a background in fine arts and years of teaching expressive art labs to all ages. She enjoys sharing tools to help everyone feel comfortable in the creative process while learning new techniques. She moved to Santa Rosa in late 2021 after growing up mostly in FL and is loving the California lifestyle.\n\nWear your artsy clothing, bring your thirst, and corks for this 2-3 hour event.\n\n* Pre-payment *(via Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal)* is required for this limited availability event. **[PLS REGISTER/PAY HERE!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHYNFReJbhlLGQh0_wl4dEJZlF3E4nmEobQzB2W93XO7tz9g/viewform?usp=publish-editor)**\n* Maximum of 20 people, **guests welcome.**\n* We suggest dressing warmly or in layers as the cellar will be a bit cold at this time.\n\nThe event starts promptly at 1:30 pm.\nPlease be a little bit early to get settled in with your wine and supplies. Tara will follow up with everyone who RSVP's 'Yes' to complete payment through her above link.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you all for this fun event in March!\nCheers!\n\\- Joleen and Dai",

Guests can test their luck with basketball-themed games for a chance to unlock special savings or surprise extras to take home. Admission is free with a complimentary reservation requested. This casual open house allows guests to arrive at their leisure and is open to guests 21 and over only; no children or pets permitted.",

She was a production potter for five years. The current focus of her “art” is the sheer pleasure of playful engagement with clay.

Attendees will hear a reading from Funeral for Flaca and view archival childhood photographs to better understand the author and how she found strength through music and writing.

Using scissors we will remove parts of the boxes until we have what we will use as our cover. Then using miscellaneous papers we fold these into the pages of our journals. With simple book-binding skills using a needle and waxed thread we will stitch the pages into our covers. We will also decorate the covers of our journals with collage papers and/or paint.Examples of completed journals will be shown and step by step instruction will be provided along with all supplies. Short exercises to boost your creativity, journal prompts, and a small gift from me are also included.Whether you are a beginning or seasoned artist/writer/crafter or just looking to try something new, this is a great way to get inspired and create something meaningful to you.About the Instructor: Rendell Hourigan received a BBA in Marketing from Texas Tech University, and has pursued art for over 25 years, focusing on sustainable mixed media.

Come join us at 4th Street Cellars in downtown Santa Rosa. They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!",

It is the word before words form—the voice too distant to be understood—a cosmic expression without country or dialect.We’ll begin with a slideshow exploring the depth and range of asemic writing. Looking at ancient scripts, global languages, symbols, the calligraphic line, and the work of contemporary asemic artists, we’ll expand our understanding of what is possible.From there, you’ll begin your own asemic journey. These marks can infiltrate and transform your current artwork, or stand alone as independent works of art.Using ink and watercolor with a variety of tools, we’ll explore how to express what does not need to be said in words. My intention is to guide you toward authentic marks—marks that arise from the heart and move beyond casual scribbling into something deeply felt and uniquely your own. All levels welcome.About the Instructor: Sherrie Lovler holds a BA in Studio Art and has been teaching calligraphy and related arts for several decades. Well-known in the Western calligraphy community, she has taught at international calligraphy conferences as well as at Ghost Ranch, Friends of Calligraphy in San Francisco, Society of Scribes in NYC, La Romita School of Art in Italy, Northern Arizona University, O’Hanlon Center for the Arts, and Sebastopol Center for the Arts. She is the author, illustrator, and designer of \"On Softer Ground: Paintings, Poems and Calligraphy\", which received a Gold Medal for Most Outstanding Book Design from the Independent Publisher Book Awards. Her newest book, \"Distant Voices,\" features 31 full-color paintings and nine poems, accompanied by an introduction exploring her thoughts and creative process Sherrie exhibits her work in juried shows, solo exhibitions, Art Trails and Art at the Source open studios in Sonoma County.

The class will use two different techniques and Jan will explain how to press flowers and which flowers hold their color best. It is a creative experience!\n\n\nTo register for this workshop, please contact Jan at: freshpressedflowercards@yahoo.com mailto:freshpressedflowercards@yahoo.com\n\nCreating note cards from pressed flowers has been Jan’s hobby for 25 years, though she has no formal art training. She utilizes color,\nshape and texture on fine quality paper, each card uniquely handmade. Jan’s home in Sebastopol is her studio: the dining room table is her workshop, the kitchen cupboards storing boxes and trays of flowers. She buy card stock by the thousand and pick blooms from her garden and other public places. Her family is used to me saying, “could we stop for just a few minutes so I can gather some… ”\n\nIt is a wonderful way of life.\n\n*A note to all students: Please park on in the East facing parking lot while attending classes.

This workshop invites you to explore abstract art through both Eastern and Western perspectives, blending meditation, movement, and mark-making to create finished, expressive paintings.Rooted in the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi, we will release the desire for perfection and welcome the unexpected. Discover the quiet magic that happens when ink meets water, when gestures emerge without planning, and when the body and breath guide the brush.The session begins with gentle centering and meditation, allowing you to work from the heart and engage your whole body in the creative process. You will practice painting the ensō—the Zen circle that expresses wholeness, presence, movement, and stillness. Using Asian brushes, ink, and watercolor, you will create calligraphic paintings with layered accents that bring depth, atmosphere, and emotion to your work.Open to all levels. No prior experience required. Ideal for artists, writers, and anyone seeking a mindful, embodied approach to creativity.About the Instructor: Sherrie Lovler holds a BA in Studio Art and has been teaching calligraphy and related arts for several decades.

This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Bring a copy of your receipt at check-in to Painting/Drawing Studio adjacent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly, heart-centered gathering where we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of compassion, protection, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and echoed across many cultures, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and all who have passed, those in transition, and those in distress.This ongoing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war, with a special focus now on the approximately 19,000 children who have perished in Israel and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple, meditative act of working with clay, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public exhibits and peace sites, offering spaces for reflection, mourning, and hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each month at SebArts, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to ages 12 - adult, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.There is no fee for this class; donations are welcome to help cover materials and expenses. More than a class, this is a shared space of warmth and care—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

I'm super excited to be able to offer a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curiosity about this fun activity, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It will consist of an introductory lesson, and then we all get to practice taking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and targets are provided by them, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours to enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-toed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!",

Learn or refresh your understanding of brush handling, brush care and setting up, the benefits of “good paper”, watercolor lights and darks, flat and graded washes, wet-on-wet techniques such as charging, wet-on-dry techniques such as glazing, color wheel, color theory, color mixing, and more. Simple applications of these techniques invite you to experiment and play.\n\nThis class is designed for adults 18+\n\n$270 for 6 classes, 2.5 hours each class\nPayable via check, cash, or Zelle.\n\n*Brushes, palettes, set-ups, and paint will be provided.*\n\n\nTo see Anne's work and to learn more about this class, please visit her website at: http://www.miraaster.com https://www.miraaster.com/ www.miraaster.com\n\n\nTo register for this workshop, please contact Anne by email at: classes@miraaster.com mailto:classes@miraaster.com mailto:amillett@gmail.com",

She has recorded more than 25 albums and has lent her talents to countless fellow artists’ recordings. In recognition of her remarkable career, Harris was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. \nHarris is one of the most admired and influential women in music. She has recorded with such diverse artists as Linda Ronstadt, Daniel Lanois, Bob Dylan, Mark Knopfler, Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Roy Orbison, Ryan Adams, Beck, Elvis Costello, Johnny Cash, Lucinda Williams, Lyle Lovett and Rodney Crowell. Few artists have achieved such honesty or have revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career, Harris continues to share the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Willman is best known as the star and creator of Netflix’s Magic for Humans and Magic Prank Show, where his signature mix of mind-blowing magic and relatable humor has made him a streaming favorite, a viral hit (1 billion views and counting), and a fan favorite for families, comedy lovers, and skeptics alike. \nHe’s appeared on The Tonight Show, The Today Show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, and Conan, and he was recently named “Stage Magician of the Year” by the Magic Castle. He’s performed at the White House, packed theaters across the country, and managed to make grown adults openly weep over a card trick. But the live show? That’s where the real magic happens. \nOne for the Ages is Justin’s biggest tour to date, featuring brand-new material and more. It’s an interactive, laugh-filled, sleight-of-mind experience that’s smart, silly, and astonishing. And yes, it’s the kind of show you can bring your kids, your date, or your dad to. All ages. All generations. All-new. \nThis is one for the ages! \n\n\nVIP Ticket to include: \n\nBest available seating\nPoster\nPost-show Meet & Greet with Justin Willman\n\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.

The class will use two different techniques and Jan will explain how to press flowers and which flowers hold their color best. It is a creative experience!\n\n\nTo register for this workshop, please contact Jan at: freshpressedflowercards@yahoo.com mailto:freshpressedflowercards@yahoo.com\n\nCreating note cards from pressed flowers has been Jan’s hobby for 25 years, though she has no formal art training. She utilizes color,\nshape and texture on fine quality paper, each card uniquely handmade. Jan’s home in Sebastopol is her studio: the dining room table is her workshop, the kitchen cupboards storing boxes and trays of flowers. She buy card stock by the thousand and pick blooms from her garden and other public places. Her family is used to me saying, “could we stop for just a few minutes so I can gather some… ”\n\nIt is a wonderful way of life.\n\n*A note to all students: Please park on in the East facing parking lot while attending classes.

Duets set a milestone in Billboard Chart history because, with the CD, Anka became the only artist to have a CD on the Billboard Top 100 Chart for seven consecutive decades. \nAt 81 years old, Paul Anka continues to write and record. His latest two albums, Making Memories and Sessions, were released in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The albums featured new and never-before recorded songs as well as new takes on old classics, notably “Put Your Head On My Shoulder,” with Olivia Newton John, one of her last recorded songs, and “My Way,” featuring Michael Buble and Andrea Bocelli. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

It follows a critically lauded debut album, See You Around, and standalone singles, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene, Watkins, Jarosz, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival, then co-founded I’m With Her, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative, fable-like storytelling, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity, access, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa.

Guests are invited to sip, savor, and connect—meeting the winemakers behind the pours and tasting dishes that reflect the rich agricultural and cultural diversity of the North Coast. \nFrom elegant caviar to bold barbecue and globally inspired flavors, the culinary offerings are as diverse as they are delicious, all complemented by live music and the vibrant energy of wine country. As festival attendee Dennis McCarter of McCarter Cellars shared, “The great food at the event elevates the great wine, and the great wine elevates the great food.” Established as a must-attend event for food and wine lovers alike, the North Coast Wine & Food Festival is more than a tasting—it’s a joyful celebration of craftsmanship, community, and the good life. \nMust be 21 or older to attend. \nDesignated driver tickets are available, along with a limited selection of non-alcoholic beverages. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose.

We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months.

    "description": "Back to All Shows\n\n\nEmporium Presents\nLeonid & Friends 2026 Tour\n\nSaturday, November 7, 2026\n\n7:30 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \n\n\nLeonid & Friends is a globally acclaimed, genre-defying 11-piece collective renowned for their astonishingly precise recreations of classic Chicago songs, as well as high-energy performances of other rock, pop, and jazz-fusion hits from the 1970s. Formed by multi-talented musician and producer Leonid Vorobyev, the group features elite vocalists and instrumentalists from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, and beyond, all united by a shared passion for celebrating this iconic era of music. \nOriginally conceived as a studio project in Moscow, Leonid & Friends skyrocketed to international fame when their note-perfect video covers went viral online, earning praise from members of Chicago themselves. What began as a YouTube phenomenon has since evolved into a world-class touring act, captivating audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. \nWith more than 500 million combined video views, multiple sold-out U.S. tours, and a devoted global fanbase, the band is beloved worldwide for honoring the classics, while expanding far beyond them \n\n\nAfter-show Meet & Greet\nMeet & Greet is a wonderful opportunity for fans to meet and interact with Leonid & Friends. Quantity is limited at each show. Shortly after the concert, attendees with a M&G wristband will be allowed to meet the band, have a group photo taken, and the opportunity to chat with band members and have merchandise or memorabilia signed.\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand. Platinum Tickets are not part of VIP packages – they are tickets only. \nPlatinum Seating provides fans with direct access to securing some of the best seats in the venue at market value. The market value for Platinum Seating is subject to change based on the overall demand and popularity for the event.  Platinum Seating allows fans to purchase tickets in a safe and secure environment without running the risk of purchasing tickets that may be considered lost, stolen, or counterfeit. \n\n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.",

His comedy specials include Fun Size, the highest rated special on Showtime, and Daddy Issues, which was even more successful. For his third special, he hosted some of the edgiest comedians in the country from the prestigious Montreal Just For Laughs Festival. His last groundbreaking special on Netflix, The Degenerates, garnered more huge ratings and rave reviews. \n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand. Platinum Tickets are not part of VIP packages – they are tickets only. \nPlatinum Seating provides fans with direct access to securing some of the best seats in the venue at market value.
