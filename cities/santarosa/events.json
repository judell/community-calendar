Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now? Practices: Guided movement warm-up; sensory awareness; movement exploration of stepping toward/away from a “threshold”; body mapping with paint/collage; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants identify their current state and set creative intentions for the series. Session 2 – Trials & Allies: Shadows and Strengths Theme: Meeting obstacles and discovering resources. Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight. Session 4 – Return with the Elixir: Integration & Wholeness Theme: Carrying creative insight back into everyday life. Practices: Movement exploration of “pathways of return”; creation of a triptych \\(Before / Crossing / Return\\); gallery walk and group witnessing; closing ritual with shared intentions. Outcome: Students integrate learning and leave with practical creative practices for ongoing self- discovery and stress relief. Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop greater self-awareness by exploring personal experiences through movement, art-making, and reflective writing. 2. Use creative tools for well-being, including techniques for emotional expression, personal renewal, and stress reduction. 3. Strengthen confidence and connection through supportive group activities and experiments with expressive movement and visual art.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

EW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AND STONEWALL BOOK AWARD • From acclaimed author Malinda Lo comes a gripping, tender coming-of-age novel exploring identity, queerness, and historical upheaval set in San Francisco’s Chinatown during the 1950s. “Lush, ambitious and layered, Malinda Lo’s sweeping historical novel is the queer romance we’ve been waiting for.”—Ms. Magazine Seventeen-year-old Lily Hu can’t remember exactly when the feeling took root—that desire to look, to move closer, to touch. Whenever it started growing, it definitely bloomed the moment she and Kathleen Miller walked under the flashing neon sign of a lesbian bar called the Telegraph Club. Suddenly, everything seemed possible. But America in 1954 is not a safe place for two girls to fall in love, especially not in Chinatown. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, including Chinese Americans like Lily. With deportation looming over her father—despite his hard-won citizenship—Lily and Kath risk everything to let their love see the light of day. Meticulously researched, emotionally stirring, and startlingly brave, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a standout work of historical fiction that has taken the world by storm.

    "description": "The Rainbow Book Club is cohosted by Mindy from Napa County Library and Napa Bookmine staff members Kass and Jules. The book club focuses on books that explore and embrace queer identity. This is a free event but we appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! We look forward to welcoming you. ABOUT THE BOOK The instant New York Times bestseller • Oprah’s Book Club Pick • Named a Best Book of 2025 by TIME, The New Yorker, Harper's Bazaar, USA Today, NPR, People, Christian Science Monitor, Scientific American, and Kirkus Reviews • A 2026 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence finalist “Stunning . . . A heartfelt and powerful examination of those living on the fringes of society, and the unique challenges they face to survive and thrive.” — Oprah Winfrey Ocean Vuong returns with a bighearted novel about chosen family, unexpected friendship, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. The hardest thing in the world is to live only once… One late summer evening in the post-industrial town of East Gladness, Connecticut, nineteen-year-old Hai stands on the edge of a bridge in pelting rain, ready to jump, when he hears someone shout across the river. The voice belongs to Grazina, an elderly widow succumbing to dementia, who convinces him to take another path. Bereft and out of options, he quickly becomes her caretaker. Over the course of the year, the unlikely pair develops a life-altering bond, one built on empathy, spiritual reckoning, and heartbreak, with the power to transform Hai’s relationship to himself, his family, and a community on the brink. Following the cycles of history, memory, and time, The Emperor of Gladness shows the profound ways in which love, labor, and loneliness form the bedrock of American life. At its heart is a brave epic about what it means to exist on the fringes of society and to reckon with the wounds that haunt our collective soul. Hallmarks of Ocean Vuong’s writing—formal innovation, syntactic dexterity, and the ability to twin grit with grace through tenderness—are on full display in this story of loss, hope, and how far we would go to possess one of life’s most fleeting mercies: a second chance. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ocean Vuong is the author of the critically acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Wounds and Time Is a Mother, as well as the New York Times bestselling novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous. A recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship and the American Book Award, he was born in Saigon, Vietnam, and currently splits his time between western Massachusetts and New York City. The Emperor of Gladness is his latest novel.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of legacy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group, meeting to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous, or not-so-famous\\) poets of the past & present who have left a mark on literature, the art of poetry, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male, female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & erotic, political, pastoral & personal, dreamers, ragers, firebrands, sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize, and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interested poets & potential participants, the library will publish this growing list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review, with a short bio & picture, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poets listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from participants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wednesday of each month, we will gather for a round-table review of several poets, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to explore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meeting to read about their chosen poet, explore one or more biographies & several poems, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gathering. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems, then we will open a discussion among the participants, after which that participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant will then read a chosen poem, followed by a discussion, as well as his or her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present, each segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei Codrescu Anna Akmatova Cesar Vallejo Dylan Thomas E.E. Cummings Elizabeth Bishop Emerald GoingSnake Federico Garcia Lorca Hannah Arendt Jalal al-Din Rumi Jessie Lamont Jesus Papoleto Melendez Joy Harjo John Berryman Kahlil Gibran Shams Hafez Katrine O Jensen Langston Hughes Maria Stepanova Mary Oliver May Sarton May Swenson Maya Angelou Omar Khayyam Pablo Neruda Silvia Plath Wallace Stevens Vaclev Pavel V.

Based in Sonoma County, California, 3 Acre Holler derives it’s name from Cori’s family property near Forestville, CA. Cori and Layne have played in a variety of bands together in Northern California for a number of years and began their duet as a way to perform songs that didn’t quite fit the happy band mold. They are drawn to Appalachian inspired material and particularly like those songs with darker themes. Unrequited love, moonshine, tragedy and death are frequent visitors to their song list. In addition to their own songs, Cori and Layne give their take on songs by contemporary writers such as Gillian Welch, Martha Scanlon, The O’Kanes, Casey Chambers and guys named Hank. They do like to sing a few happy songs about love, birds and butterflies as well, so don’t worry about leaving one of their gigs in a mopey mood. Instead, you will likely leave their gig with respect for the talent and material they present and possibly with a copy of their new cd in your hand!\n\nSource: GoLocal Cooperative",

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nJoin us for an axe-throwing session to blow off some steam. I'm super excited to be able to offer a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curiosity about this fun activity, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It will consist of an introductory lesson, and then we all get to practice taking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and targets are provided by them, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours to enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-toed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These women, in secrecy and subterfuge, courageously and devotedly continued their practices and worship for centuries and passed down their traditions. About the Author: Lindsey Stewart is a Black feminist philosopher and an Associate Professor of philosophy at the University of Memphis. She is the author of The Politics of Black Joy.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists, Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love, paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

These women, in secrecy and subterfuge, courageously and devotedly continued their practices and worship for centuries and passed down their traditions. About the Author: Lindsey Stewart is a Black feminist philosopher and an Associate Professor of philosophy at the University of Memphis. She is the author of The Politics of Black Joy. Her work has been featured in Blavity, Signs, Hypatia, and the British Journal for the History of Philosophy, and she holds a 2021 Michael Beaney Prize.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

It is structured to serve artists at various stages of development, from those applying foundational knowledge to advanced students exploring profound expressive concepts.\n\nPhase 1: Project Proposal & Private Consultation: All students submit a project proposal. You will meet individually and privately with the instructor to define the scope, set challenging yet achievable goals based on your current skill level, and create a comprehensive roadmap for the duration of the course. This ensures a productive and focused experience, regardless of whether you are a recent beginner or an advanced painter.\n\nPhase 2: Weekly Problem-Solving Studio: You work independently on your project, benefiting from the structure of a studio environment.

This monthly gathering, lead by Britt Sandkulla-Sinclair of Golden Thread Alchemy, explores the connection between personal practice and collective action, creating space for those who believe the two are inherently linked. Based on Sarah Lyons' transformative book of the same name, we explore the radical roots of witchcraft as community care, self-preservation, and resistance. From kitchen table remedies to protest protection, historical practices to modern applications, we're reclaiming tools that have empowered the marginalized for centuries. Because let's face it - the world is pretty messed up right now, and looking away isn't an option. We're making a pact with ourselves and each other to stay engaged, even when it's uncomfortable.

    "description": "How do you write love songs when you’re heartbroken? How do you sing about hope and passion when yours is lost? How do you finish an album when the relationship that inspired it has ended?\n\nDuring the Summer of 2017, David Ramirez had fallen in love with a woman who, despite having only just met, felt incredibly familiar to him. There was a scary but comfortable feeling of deja vu within their moments together. “In past relationships, no matter how eager I was to feel loved and to give love, there had always been a hesitation to crawl out of my old life. I didn’t feel this with her,” he recollects.\n\nRamirez began to pen songs for his next album and hopeful odes to new love spilled out. Songs like “Lover, Will You Lead Me?” filled with vivid images from the heart: I recognized you from some distant dream / Like when it rains on a cold day / I had a chill in my bones / Is it true what they say / “When you know, you know.” \n\nThese were followed by sultry, romantic ballads about how love matures and grows. He wrote “I Wanna Live In Your Bedroom” while sitting on his lover’s bed just minutes after waking up on a hazy fall day. “I was looking around at all the perfectly curated pieces in her room,” he says. “Everything was so intentional and held a story and a place in her heart. I wanted to be one of those pieces.”\n\nOne after another, Ramirez poured his soul into a new work of art that covered both the sweet parts of love and the hard times it can bring. He wrote about potential, survival, hope, and encouragement. He wrote about partnership. \n\nBut art is often bred from spontaneity and suffers under the confines of routines and borders. This is a conflicting dynamic that can cause massive problems when you’re building a partnership, when you’re part of a team. A seeming “whatever” attitude can foster insecurity and doubt in a lover. As more and more troubles emerged in his relationship, Ramirez found solace still at the tip of his pen, holding his guitar, sitting at his piano. \n\n“I was born in August of 1983 just days after Hurricane Alicia had hit my hometown of Houston. As my relationship began ripping at the seams, I started to think of this storm as a precursor to my being born,” Ramirez confides. “Was there something in the universe that imprinted a characteristic of chaos in my blood during my last few days in the womb? Was I destined to wreak havoc everywhere I went?”\n\nSoon, the relationship that had inspired a new burst of creativity in Ramirez and moved him to start writing an album unlike any he had ever attempted before, came to an end. And with that ending, he still had one last song to write. His heart exhausted, he sat on his patio one night and tried to process all of the lyrics that he knew he had written, yet now left him feeling like a stranger to his own story. Through tears and muffled whimpers, he started to write down all of his negative thoughts about love and put the pain of his broken heart into words. From this emotional purge, he began to see the beauty in what he had gone through: the struggle, the pain, the confusion. He soon found himself writing the lyrics that would become album standout “Hallelujah, Love Is Real!”\n\n“I was reminded of a great line in the film Vanilla Sky, ‘The sweet is never as sweet without the sour.’ I decided to celebrate Love,” he explains. “I wasn’t gonna write about how it made me feel in that moment. I was going to write about its existence and how thankful I am having known it.”\n\nThis chapter of Ramirez’s life came to a close in the form of his forthcoming 10-song set, My Love Is A Hurricane, recorded with producer Jason Burt at Modern Electric Studios in Dallas, TX. For the first time in his career, he did no pre-production ahead of time, working from gut feelings throughout the process and spending most of his time in the studio on the edge of his seat. The resulting R&B-influenced, piano-driven production is highlighted by heavy basslines and synths with the occasional gospel backing. This experimentation with new melodies and rhythms places Ramirez’s deeply personal songwriting on top of dreamy, groove-driven landscapes that heal the heart and promote positivity while prompting listeners to want to sing \\(and dance\\) along.\n\nMy Love Is A Hurricane is Ramirez’s fifth full-length record and eighth collection of songs. Early albums like American Soil \\(2009\\) and Apologies \\(2012\\) put him on the map both locally and beyond, while his STRANGETOWN \\(2011\\) and The Rooster \\(2013\\) EPs delivered fan-favorite recordings, “Shoeboxes” and “The Bad Days respectively, that are staple singalongs at his concerts to this day. He made his Thirty Tigers debut with 2015’s FABLES, produced by Noah Gundersen, which features his most widely received single to date, “Harder to Lie.” While this earlier work landed Ramirez firmly in the singer/songwriter canon, a need to do more exploring sonically led to the expansive sound of his most recent album, We’re Not Going Anywhere \\(2017\\). Influenced by ‘80s bands like The Cars and Journey, it is lyrically reflective of the country’s intense political landscape framed from his perspective as a bi-racial American of Mexican heritage.\n\nAs songwriters evolve as people, so does their art, and that could not be more apparent than on Ramirez’s newest offering. The soundscapes utilized on My Love Is A Hurricane may be unlike any recording he has previously crafted, but it's not a departure from his journey. It's a new path created in order to tell a new story. A new canvas needed to hold the scene that his intensely personal lyrics are painting.\n\n“David Ramirez has a voice like a tall tale, one minute strong and thick, the next threadbare and careworn.” — Stereogum\n\n“Mr. Ramirez is a resolutely hesitant singer, never pushing his hurt, letting it instead decay him from within.” — The New York Times\n\n“It's not easy for a writer to maintain the aura of the unspoken in a song. Music and the space surrounding it intensify the impact of confession; the true challenge comes in giving voice to a narrator who's tongue-tied, or simply reticent. Texas singer-songwriter David Ramirez does so beautifully…” — NPR Music\n\n“Quietly mesmerizing” — The Wall Street Journal\n\n“A powerful voice and perceptive pen” — Austin Chronicle\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Understanding the History and Use of the Term &ldquo;Latinx&rdquo;\n\nLos Cien Program\n\nThe term Latinx emerged as an alternative to Latino and Latina, aiming to provide gender inclusivity and cultural recognition across diverse identities within the Latin American diaspora. Yet, its adoption has sparked deep discussion and, at times, division within our community.\n\nThis program invites a thoughtful, respectful dialogue about the evolution of this term &mdash; exploring its linguistic roots, social context, and the varied perspectives it evokes among Latin American, Chicano, and Hispanic communities in Sonoma County and beyond. The goal is to foster understanding, connection, and belonging through an informed and inclusive conversation that honors our community's diversity.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists, Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love, paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Gualala Arts invites the community to experience “Creations,” a group exhibition featuring the distinctive works of three local artists—Ling-Yen Jones, James Docker, and Bea Acosta. This compelling blend of art and craft opens with a reception on Friday, February 13, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Jacob Foyer. The exhibit will remain on view through March 8, offering visitors a chance to explore the unique perspectives and materials each artist brings to their practice.\n\nJames Docker, a seasoned woodworker and designer, brings decades of craftsmanship and conceptual depth to the show. With a Master of Fine Arts from San Francisco State University and formative years spent studying in Kyoto, Japan, Docker’s work reflects a rich tapestry of influences—from Japanese boro textiles and tea ceremony aesthetics to the geometric clarity of Piet Mondrian. His pieces often echo the improvisational structure of jazz, a genre he reveres, and his approach to wood has been described as “quilting in wood.” Docker’s career spans over 60 years, including custom home design throughout The Sea Ranch, Napa Valley, and the Bay Area. His knife blocks and boards, originally crafted for friends and neighbors, exemplify his commitment to both beauty and utility.\n\nJewelry artist Ling-Yen Jones offers a striking contrast with her finely wrought silver, semi-precious stones, and pearls. Based in Mendocino County, Jones creates one-of-a-kind pieces that range from traditional to modern, often incorporating motifs such as leaves, birds, and windows—symbols of growth, hope, and transformation. Her training includes studies with David Laplantz at Humboldt State University, Monterey Peninsula College, and workshops at the Mendocino Art Center. Jones is also the gallery coordinator for the Coast Highway Artist Collective in Point Arena and has exhibited widely across Northern California. Her work, including evocative pieces like “Unmentionables,” draws inspiration from the Ukiyo-E period of Japanese art, blending expressive faces with hidden floral and romantic imagery to explore themes of serenity and everyday grace.\n\nBea Acosta rounds out the trio with her creations in clay and pine needle basketry. Since discovering her passion for clay in 2000, Acosta has studied under Kay Like of Brandybuck Studios, embracing hand-building techniques and natural finishes such as saggar firing with seaweed and horsehair. Her journey expanded in 2004 to include pine needle basketry, where she now devotes most of her creative energy. Using materials like Watsonia and Amaryllis leaves, sweet grass, and sea grass, Acosta weaves vibrant, one-of-a-kind forms that often transcend traditional basket function. Her “pine needle woven creations” are meditative, free-form expressions that reflect a deep reverence for nature and ancestral memory. Living on the coast continues to inspire her intuitive, organic approach to making.\n\nTogether, Jones, Docker, and Acosta offer a rich and varied exhibition that celebrates the intersection of artistry and craftsmanship. “Creations” promises to be a feast for the senses and a testament to the creative spirit thriving along the Mendonoma coast. \n\nCreations\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Together, the works highlight a rare and meaningful artistic relationship and a shared creative spirit that bridges visual art and music culture.\n\n“We are honored to feature Roberta Weir at City Arts Gallery,” said Carmen Slack, Executive Director of the Solano County Arts Council. “Her connection to an important chapter of American music history, combined with her own unique artistic vision, makes this exhibit truly special for our community.”\n\nThe City Arts Gallery is dedicated to highlighting exceptional regional artists and providing accessible, high-quality cultural experiences in downtown Vallejo. This exhibition continues that mission by celebrating a local artist whose work resonates far beyond the gallery walls.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated exhibit offers visitors a unique opportunity to experience the intersection of fine art, mentorship, and cultural history, revealing a lesser-known dimension of Jerry Garcia’s creative life while honoring Roberta Weir’s lasting influence and artistic vision.\n\nThe exhibition also acknowledges the broader creative ecosystem surrounding Garcia, including his connection to legendary concert promoter Bill Graham, whose influence extended through many artists and cultural figures. Several local artists in the Vallejo arts community share historical and creative ties to this vibrant era of music and art.\n\nThe opening of the exhibition will be during the free Vallejo Art Walk on Friday, February 13, 2026, at City Arts Gallery, 420 Virginia Street, downtown Vallejo.The City Arts Gallery is dedicated to celebrating exceptional regional artists and presenting engaging exhibitions that are accessible to the public and rooted in community.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Grains of Sand is a positive “coming-of-age” story about two women in their 80s. Filmed over eight years, the documentary accompanies the filmmaker’s mother and mother-in-law, artists and close friends, as they enter their ninth decade. The Grains of Sand Film Screening will be followed by a Collage Workshop designed to engage with the themes of the film and use them to reflect on our own lives.\n\nTHE FILM\n\nMargot & Barbara, close friends and artists, meet for a work retreat in a stone farmhouse in the German countryside. They are both about to turn 80. As they begin to work on the large stones they have brought to sculpt, they embark on a conversation about creativity and aging, exploring what it means for them to arrive at this stage of their lives. Their wrinkled hands become dusty as they scrape and chisel the stones.\n\nTHE DISCUSSION\n\nWith humor and empathy, Grains of Sand demystifies the aging process and builds identification with the protagonists. The film collapses the experience of eight years into 85 minutes. This moving narrative arc invites people of all ages to engage with what it means to grow old and what matters most as we do so.\n\nTHE COLLAGE WORKSHOP\n\nArt for Barbara and Margot is a way of living. Throughout the film, art transcends the sensual experience to become also a way of reflecting on life itself.\n\nBuilding on the film, Collage Workshop participants will have a chance to experiment in a tactile, visual realm. We discuss scenes from the film which continue to resonate for us, and at the same time begin to play with color and shapes on the page. We can use the materials in front of us to fold in thoughts, memories and references to lived events. Participants find themselves sharing aspects of who they are and connecting with the other participants in unexpected ways. The conversation with those around us at the table becomes a dialogue with ourselves, a kind of collage self-portrait in the materials we bring to paper.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Based in Sonoma County, California, 3 Acre Holler derives it’s name from Cori’s family property near Forestville, CA. Cori and Layne have played in a variety of bands together in northern California for a number of years and began their duet as a way to perform songs that didn’t quite fit the happy band mold. They are drawn to Appalachian inspired material and particularly like those songs with darker themes. Unrequited love, moonshine, tragedy and death are frequent visitors to their song list. In addition to their own songs, Cori and Layne give their take on songs by contemporary writers such as Gillian Welch, Martha Scanlon, The O’Kanes, Casey Chambers and guys named Hank. They do like to sing a few happy songs about love, birds and butterflies as well, so don’t worry about leaving one of their gigs in a mopey mood. Instead, you will likely leave their gig with respect for the talent and material they present and possibly with a copy of their new cd in your hand!\n\nSource: GoLocal Cooperative",

    "description": "SANTA ROSA -- Copperfield's Books welcomes award-winning author Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes to Montgomery Village for her stunning new novel - The Pohaku. Embrace the Aloha spirit with a reading and warm discussion followed by an audience Q&A and book signing. This is a free event, registration recommended. From the award-winning author of Hula, a dazzling saga that moves from Hawaii to California and back, about the generations of women tasked with protecting the history and place that made them. A young woman lies in a hospital bed in a coma, watched over by her estranged grandmother. Some say she jumped off the cliff; others say she was swept away by a wave. But her tutu at her bedside suspects something else is wrong, that the reason for the hardship and heartbreak in their family history is tied to a story that she's never told-one about a powerful stone, the pohaku, that her family was tasked with protecting generations ago. In fits and starts, the grandmother begins . . . We travel back in time to the eighteenth century, when the explorer James Cook becomes the first European to visit the Hawaiian Islands. Cook arrives in pursuit of an ancient prophecy, a key that would unlock the mysteries of the world, but he is killed before he can learn about the mysterious stone-a stone born alongside future Hawaiian royalty, the key to something even more powerful than Cook could have imagined. So begins a thrilling family saga of the women charged with protecting the pohaku, as it is taken from Hawai'i to California and possibly beyond, bringing fortune to the well-intentioned and misfortune to the bad. But with each successive generation, the fractures caused by its displacement widen until it becomes clear that the pohaku's story must survive if there is to be any hope at all of the family's-and a nation's-reconciliation with their home, with nature, and with each other. Reminiscent of Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing, Min Jin Lee's Pachinko, and Tommy Orange's There, There, The Pohaku is an immersive and bold novel about the history, perseverance, and resilience of the Hawaiian people. Author: Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes was born and raised in Hilo, Hawai'i. She is the author of the novel Hula, winner of HONOLULU Magazine's 2024 Book of the Year. She is the recipient of the Best Fiction award from the Southern California Writers Conference, a LoJo Foundation Scholarship, a Writing by Writers Emerging Voices fellowship, and residencies from Hedgebrook, VCCA, and Storyknife. She lives in California.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Gurney. \n\nThe production will reprise the performances of Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, CEO of YWCA Sonoma County, as Melissa Gardner, and former Press Democrat columnist Chris Smith as Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. The longtime Sonoma County friends first appeared in Love Letters in 2016. \n\nTicket sales for the play will raise much-needed funds for YWCA’s vital and singular domestic violence programs serving local families who find themselves in danger in their homes – the place we should all feel safest. For 50 years, YWCA Sonoma County has been the county’s answer to the need by families for refuge, advocacy, and support with domestic violence. \n\nLove Letters is based on the lifelong, intimate correspondence of these two characters whose entire story unfolds through written words exchanged in the form of letters. In a relationship spanning 50 years, their letters contain their hopes and ambitions, dreams and disappointments, victories and defeats throughout their separate lives. \n\nAfter debuting in 1988, Love Letters quickly moved to both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. Over the years, the roles were performed by notable actors such as Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow, Carol Burnett with Dennehy, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen, as well as Angelica Huston and Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. \n\nAccording to Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, “In addition to the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, people deserve respect, dignity and safety to conduct productive lives and care for their children. YWCA is honored to be a leader in the efforts to address needs so many people take for granted.”  \n\nChris Smith, who retired from the PD in 2021 but still contributes to the newspaper on occasion, said, “Bringing the power of the written word and the lost art of letter writing together with support for YWCA Sonoma County is a winning combination for me.” \n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\n\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Back to All Shows\n\n\nYWCA Sonoma County Presents\nLove Letters\n\nFriday, February 13, 2026\n\n7:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \nCelebrating 50 years of service to the community, the domestic violence service provider YWCA Sonoma County is presenting for one show only, a fundraising performance of Love Letters, the acclaimed play by A.R. Gurney. \nThe production will reprise the performances of Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, CEO of YWCA Sonoma County, as Melissa Gardner, and former Press Democrat columnist Chris Smith as Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. The longtime Sonoma County friends first appeared in Love Letters in 2016. \nTicket sales for the play will raise much-needed funds for YWCA’s vital and singular domestic violence programs serving local families who find themselves in danger in their homes – the place we should all feel safest. For 50 years, YWCA Sonoma County has been the county’s answer to the need by families for refuge, advocacy, and support with domestic violence. \nLove Letters is based on the lifelong, intimate correspondence of these two characters whose entire story unfolds through written words exchanged in the form of letters. In a relationship spanning 50 years, their letters contain their hopes and ambitions, dreams and disappointments, victories and defeats throughout their separate lives. \nAfter debuting in 1988, Love Letters quickly moved to both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. Over the years, the roles were performed by notable actors such as Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow, Carol Burnett with Dennehy, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen, as well as Angelica Huston and Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. \nAccording to Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, “In addition to the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, people deserve respect, dignity and safety to conduct productive lives and care for their children. YWCA is honored to be a leader in the efforts to address needs so many people take for granted.”  \nChris Smith, who retired from the PD in 2021 but still contributes to the newspaper on occasion, said, “Bringing the power of the written word and the lost art of letter writing together with support for YWCA Sonoma County is a winning combination for me.” \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.\n\nSource: Luther Burbank Center",

    "description": "SANTA ROSA -- Copperfield's Books welcomes award-winning author Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes to Montgomery Village for her stunning new novel - The Pohaku. Embrace the Aloha spirit with a reading and warm discussion followed by an audience Q&A and book signing. This is a free event, registration recommended. From the award-winning author of Hula, a dazzling saga that moves from Hawaii to California and back, about the generations of women tasked with protecting the history and place that made them. A young woman lies in a hospital bed in a coma, watched over by her estranged grandmother. Some say she jumped off the cliff; others say she was swept away by a wave. But her tutu at her bedside suspects something else is wrong, that the reason for the hardship and heartbreak in their family history is tied to a story that she's never told-one about a powerful stone, the pohaku, that her family was tasked with protecting generations ago. In fits and starts, the grandmother begins . . . We travel back in time to the eighteenth century, when the explorer James Cook becomes the first European to visit the Hawaiian Islands. Cook arrives in pursuit of an ancient prophecy, a key that would unlock the mysteries of the world, but he is killed before he can learn about the mysterious stone-a stone born alongside future Hawaiian royalty, the key to something even more powerful than Cook could have imagined. So begins a thrilling family saga of the women charged with protecting the pohaku, as it is taken from Hawai'i to California and possibly beyond, bringing fortune to the well-intentioned and misfortune to the bad. But with each successive generation, the fractures caused by its displacement widen until it becomes clear that the pohaku's story must survive if there is to be any hope at all of the family's-and a nation's-reconciliation with their home, with nature, and with each other. Reminiscent of Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing, Min Jin Lee's Pachinko, and Tommy Orange's There, There, The Pohaku is an immersive and bold novel about the history, perseverance, and resilience of the Hawaiian people. Author: Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes was born and raised in Hilo, Hawai'i. She is the author of the novel Hula, winner of HONOLULU Magazine's 2024 Book of the Year. She is the recipient of the Best Fiction award from the Southern California Writers Conference, a LoJo Foundation Scholarship, a Writing by Writers Emerging Voices fellowship, and residencies from Hedgebrook, VCCA, and Storyknife. She lives in California.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Snag a table for 4 with preferred seating, your own private call button to summon service, and your first round of drinks (or a bottle of wine) for only $95!\n\nEvery Friday night hilarious comedians from The Bay Area and beyond perform at Barrel Proof Lounge. Stick around after for late-night karaoke &DJ Dancing!\n\nFresh lineup of funny each Friday.\n\nThis Week: Casey Williams (host) Jeremy Talamantes Juan Carlos\n\nHeadliner: Phil Johnson “A benchmark of intelligent zaniness.” – The Milpitas Post “A ‘raging optimist’ is how Johnson describes himself and his comedy reflects his love of upbeat topics and eschews the snarky, negative tone of many others.” – Solano Daily Republic “Comedian Phil Johnson tickles crowds with his jocular jams.” – The San Jose Metro “Phil continued his show with intense energy to the very last joke. His jokes spared no one and spun so quickly at times he would wait for the audience to catch up. ” – The Copper Gazette\n\nBiography Phil Johnson is a man who gets mistaken for a woman, but only by those not paying attention. That revelation kicks off a battle for self-awareness where comedy and music are the weapons of choice. It’s a battle that has taken Phil to such esteemed festivals as the Edinburgh Fringe and Sundance Film Festivals and the Top 8 Finals of the World Series of Comedy .\n\n“I’ve always been the guy who isn’t quite what people expect,” says Phil. Using that experience, Phil pokes holes in the medical marijuana argument, discusses being a white guy at a hip hop show (and the innocent gestures that can get him in trouble), and reveals why Hawaii isn’t the paradise we think it is. From Shakespearean bees to redneck vampires to anthropomorphic cell phones with weight issues, Phil Johnson fills the stage with quirky characters that combine social satire with absurdist flights of fancy. Then the guitar comes out and kicks the show into an even higher gear with songs about the bright future (and dark past) of babies and what he would do if he woke up one morning as an actual woman.\n\nOn stage, Phil’s playful humor and likeable, endearing manner allow him to shake things up without antagonizing the audience. In the end we can only be who we are, try to understand others, and hope they understand us.\n\n21+ Doors - 7p / Show - 8p $15adv / $20door\n\nCheck out **www.BarrelProofLounge.com** for all sorts of good times ahead.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

With a sharp eye for the absurd and a linguist’s love of wordplay, he tackles topics like tech, body image, race, and American weirdness - all delivered from the viewpoint of a guy who happily grew up in the deeply multi-everything community of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPhil’s material is smart, satirical, and unafraid to ask bigger questions while still chasing the laugh.\n\nHe’s been featured at the Sundance Film Festival, Edinburgh Fringe Festival, on Sirius/XM, Bob & Tom Radio, and Amazon Prime. Phil has released multiple comedy specials and albums that showcase his signature blend of tightly written jokes, catchy \\(and occasionally naughty\\) songs, and a performer’s instinct for balancing insight with irreverence.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Before joining forces, the duo behind Sgt. Splendor were already formidable solo artists, Kate Vargas chalking up acclaim at outlets like NPR, SPIN, and Vice \\(including praise from the “Dean of American Rock Critics” Robert Christgau\\); and Eric McFadden amassing an impressive resume including stints on guitar with George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, Fishbone’s Angelo Moore, and Eric Burdon & The Animals, plus a slew of solo albums, and session work with everyone from Jackson Browne to The Clash’s Joe Strummer.\n\nSgt. Splendor’s intoxicating chemistry on the new album has its roots not just in enduring friendships, but also in the love and connection of its creative partners, Vargas and McFadden. After circling each other’s orbits for a time, they finally met at a songwriting retreat hosted by Pat MacDonald \\(of Timbuk 3 / “Future’s So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades” fame\\) in Sturgeon Bay, WI, initially bonding over yet another parallel, a New Mexico upbringing. Their Southwestern roots upbringing come through with Sgt. Splendor—combining mysterioso desert and carnivalesque Waits-ian vibe.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Sheng’s first Netflix special, Sweet & Juicy (2022), produced and directed by Ali Wong, was praised for his laid-back delivery and sharp observations on everyday life. He will return to Netflix with a new special at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., which is set for release in 2026. The special is produced by Ali Wong, Sheng Wang, and John Irwin. Sheng has also appeared on HBO’s 2 Dope Queens and wrote for ABC’s Fresh Off the Boat. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Snag a table for 4 with preferred seating, your own private call button to summon service, and your first round of drinks (or a bottle of wine) for only $95!\n\nEvery Friday night hilarious comedians from The Bay Area and beyond perform at Barrel Proof Lounge. Stick around after for late-night karaoke &DJ Dancing!\n\nFresh lineup of funny each Friday.\n\nThis Week: Casey Williams (host) Jeremy Talamantes Juan Carlos\n\nHeadliner: Phil Johnson “A benchmark of intelligent zaniness.” – The Milpitas Post “A ‘raging optimist’ is how Johnson describes himself and his comedy reflects his love of upbeat topics and eschews the snarky, negative tone of many others.” – Solano Daily Republic “Comedian Phil Johnson tickles crowds with his jocular jams.” – The San Jose Metro “Phil continued his show with intense energy to the very last joke. His jokes spared no one and spun so quickly at times he would wait for the audience to catch up. ” – The Copper Gazette\n\nBiography Phil Johnson is a man who gets mistaken for a woman, but only by those not paying attention. That revelation kicks off a battle for self-awareness where comedy and music are the weapons of choice. It’s a battle that has taken Phil to such esteemed festivals as the Edinburgh Fringe and Sundance Film Festivals and the Top 8 Finals of the World Series of Comedy .\n\n“I’ve always been the guy who isn’t quite what people expect,” says Phil. Using that experience, Phil pokes holes in the medical marijuana argument, discusses being a white guy at a hip hop show (and the innocent gestures that can get him in trouble), and reveals why Hawaii isn’t the paradise we think it is. From Shakespearean bees to redneck vampires to anthropomorphic cell phones with weight issues, Phil Johnson fills the stage with quirky characters that combine social satire with absurdist flights of fancy. Then the guitar comes out and kicks the show into an even higher gear with songs about the bright future (and dark past) of babies and what he would do if he woke up one morning as an actual woman.\n\nOn stage, Phil’s playful humor and likeable, endearing manner allow him to shake things up without antagonizing the audience. In the end we can only be who we are, try to understand others, and hope they understand us.\n\n21+ Doors - 7p / Show - 8p $15adv / $20door\n\nCheck out **www.BarrelProofLounge.com** for all sorts of good times ahead.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Register for more than one workshop and receive a 10% discount. Sign up for all three to make it a full day experience at 20% off! In this workshop, participants will learn the structure of Masunaga’s original bookbinding technique “Waterwheel Binding” by creating a simple model. The session offers a hands-on introduction to the technique and invites participants to explore its unique creative potential. The structure lends itself to many variations, and it can serve as a source of new ideas for participants’ own artistic projects. Waterwheel Binding is a bookbinding technique originally developed in 2011 for the work The Intersection. Instead of using glue, single-sheet pages are woven into an accordion-folded cover with narrow paper strips. The technique can be adapted in many ways by changing the materials or the scale, giving participants the freedom to develop their own creative ideas. The workshop is intended for participants who have an interest in making things – such as artists or those with some bookbinding experience – rather than complete beginners.\n\nJapanese Guest Artist Bookmaking Series\n\nThis class is part of a 3 part series. Register for 2 classes using the code double to receive 10% off your total registration cost for all 3 classes. Register for 3 classes using the code triple to receive 20% off your total registration cost for all 3 classes.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

In this Valentine’s Day poetry writing workshop, spiritual director and author Colette Lafia invites participants to explore the poetry of love as a form of prayer. Drawing from her new book, Leaving the Shore: Experiencing Poetry as Prayer, Colette will guide us into a gentle, contemplative space where writing becomes a way of listening—to our lives, to love in its many forms, and to the presence of the Divine moving within and around us.\n\nTogether, we will slow down and create a holy spaciousness around our experiences of love: romantic love, self-love, divine love, love shaped by longing, grief, devotion, and grace. Through guided writing prompts, brief readings from her new book, quiet reflection, and contemplative pauses, participants will allow words to emerge as poetry and prayer: tender, imperfect, and true.\n\nDuring our time together, you’ll be invited to:\n\nExperience poetry writing as a contemplative, prayerful practice\n\nListen for the poetry of love unfolding in your life\n\nWrite in response to guided prompts rooted in sacred listening\n\nReflect in quiet community, with space for sharing if desired\n\nAll are welcome, whether you’ve written poetry before or are new to it. Come and write your way into love.​\n\nParticipants are encouraged to get a copy of Leaving the Shore: Experiencing Poetry as Prayer, as it will be used throughout the workshop.\n\nRegister at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/poetry-of-love\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

This hands-on experience will guide you through basic knowledge of the natural slow fermentation process using sourdough starter to create nourishing bread for your daily meal with seasonal ingredients. As you learn to mix, knead, fold, and shape, you will start to gain a connection with your dough and how gluten works to create fluffy focaccia bread. With my passion for whole grains, I will guide you on how to incorporate whole grains into your flour mix to make your focaccia more hearty and wholesome. We will cover what seasonal ingredients would be best to top the focaccia and what to avoid.  You will get to taste focaccia and a side salad for lunch, and bring home some dough to bake the next day, now that you know what to do and a starter for your next sourdough baking adventure.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

To be intimate, we must learn to be fully present. Through partner meditations, verbal and nonverbal communication exercises, and group discussion, participants will practice the art of intimacy and evidence-informed skills that strengthen connection and emotional understanding to deepen the shared journey. Debra and George, both psychotherapists and married for 44 years, bring warmth, humor, and extensive clinical experience to this exploration of relational mindfulness. This program is designed and appropriate for couples, as much of the day involves partner practices.\n\nImportant note: This event is not appropriate for attending alone, as the majority of the day will be spent in partner practice. BOTH partners must register for the program separately, even if you will be sharing a Zoom account. Program rate is per person.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Register for more than one workshop and receive a 10% discount. Sign up for all three to make it a full day experience at 20% off! This book was designed by Adachi for a work inspired by DNA and the growth of the giant beanstalk. Its defining feature is a dynamic spiral structure created solely by folding two long sheets of paper, without the use of glue or thread. In this workshop, participants work with two long sheets of paper and thin colored papers. One of the long sheets is translucent and folded in half lengthwise. Participants freely insert colored paper between the folded layers. As the structure is folded and completed, participants discover how the inserted colors shift and emerge through the spiral form. Anyone interested in making things can participate. No prior bookmaking experience is required.\n\nJapanese Guest Artist Bookmaking Series\n\nThis class is part of a 3 part series. Register for 2 classes using the code double to receive 10% off your total registration cost for all 3 classes.

Please arrive ten minutes before and register in the main office.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nThis class is active and jam-packed with children and folk songs. Together we sing, dance, twirl, skip and fly while we experience the joy of making music. During each class children learn the words of simple songs, anticipate the timing of echo songs and glow with excitement during our movement songs.

Register for more than one workshop and receive a 10% discount. Sign up for all three to make it a full day experience at 20% off! This workshop focuses on making boxes using vintage Japanese colored paper. Both the size and construction method of the boxes are carefully designed to minimize paper waste. The core structure of each box is created using a contemporary bookbinding technique known as the V-cut, which allows the corners to be exceptionally sharp and beautifully finished. We hope you will discover a unique charm in these boxes, which combine old materials with new techniques–offering a character different from that of brand-new boxes. Each set consists of a box base and a matching lid. You may choose from three available sizes, as well as your preferred colored paper from approximately ten different varieties of vintage Japanese paper. During the workshop, you will assemble pre-cut core components and use a traditional Japanese brush to apply paste and carefully mount the colored paper onto the surface of the box.

Restore Harmony Through Sound.\n\nExperience transpersonal states of consciousness, pure bliss, cessation of mind chatter, accessing a full spectrum of emotions and receiving highly intuitive “downloads” as you immerse yourself in Eostar’s Sound Healing Odyssey.\n\nRelease, cleanse, re-align body, mind, soul and spirit, using these ancient tools. Eostar’s sound journeys are meditations guided by the sound of various instruments, with varying frequencies and vibrations…most of which are rich in overtones that resonate deeply in one’s body and auric field. These overtones can lead one into a state of total relaxation in which healing and connection to a higher consciousness usually happens spontaneously.\n\nEostar has played sacred acoustic music and sound healing music to audiences along the West Coast and South America for more than two decades as a devotional musician and as sound healer.  She creates sound-scapes using didgeridoo, tank-drums, kalimbas, drums, monochord, crystal bowls, chimes, Tibetan bowls, guitar, Gong and throat-singing.\n\nEostar is a Clinical Hypnotherapist and breathwork teacher as well and she loves weaving these tools together with the sound bath experience she orchestrates.\n\nBegin your afternoon with a journey to the heart during Eostar’s group hypnosis event in the EESystem™  at Noon. \n\nAbout Eostar\n\nEostar Kamala is a multifaceted healer and musician, specializing in therapeutic hypnosis, transformational shadow work, and sound healing. With certifications from the Hypnosis Motivation Institute as a Master Hypnotist and Hypnotherapist, she blends her extensive education—including breathwork facilitation and shamanic training—with her passion for guiding others through their inner journeys.\n\nNow based in Mount Shasta’s energy vortex, Eostar continues to evolve as a teacher and facilitator of plant medicine ceremonies while sharing her devotional music with the world. Her mission is to empower others to embrace their own paths toward healing and self-discovery.\n\nAbout EESystem™​\n\nThe EESystem™ is a ecologically & environmentally safe system used by individuals, doctors, and therapists as well as Meditation and Wellness Centers to improve human development and psychological well-being.  Decades of documented research on the EESystem™ shows people experience improved immune function, relief from pain, detoxification, elevated moods, increased energy, and much more.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*Journey Beyond the Mind. Restore Harmony Through Sound.*\n\nExperience transpersonal states of consciousness, pure bliss, cessation of mind chatter, accessing a full spectrum of emotions and receiving highly intuitive “downloads” as you immerse yourself in Eostar’s Sound Healing Odyssey.\n\nRelease, cleanse, re-align body, mind, soul and spirit, using these ancient tools. Eostar’s sound journeys are meditations guided by the sound of various instruments, with varying frequencies and vibrations…most of which are rich in overtones that resonate deeply in one’s body and auric field. These overtones can lead one into a state of total relaxation in which healing and connection to a higher consciousness usually happens spontaneously.\n\nEostar has played sacred acoustic music and sound healing music to audiences along the West Coast and South America for more than two decades as a devotional musician and as sound healer.  She creates sound-scapes using didgeridoo, tank-drums, kalimbas, drums, monochord, crystal bowls, chimes, Tibetan bowls, guitar, Gong and throat-singing.\n\nEostar is a Clinical Hypnotherapist and breathwork teacher as well and she loves weaving these tools together with the sound bath experience she orchestrates.\n\nBegin your afternoon with a journey to the heart during Eostar’s group hypnosis event in the EESystem™  at Noon. \n\nAbout Eostar\n\nEostar Kamala is a multifaceted healer and musician, specializing in therapeutic hypnosis, transformational shadow work, and sound healing. With certifications from the Hypnosis Motivation Institute as a Master Hypnotist and Hypnotherapist, she blends her extensive education—including breathwork facilitation and shamanic training—with her passion for guiding others through their inner journeys.\n\nNow based in Mount Shasta’s energy vortex, Eostar continues to evolve as a teacher and facilitator of plant medicine ceremonies while sharing her devotional music with the world. Her mission is to empower others to embrace their own paths toward healing and self-discovery.\n\nAbout EESystem™​\n\nThe EESystem™ is a ecologically & environmentally safe system used by individuals, doctors, and therapists as well as Meditation and Wellness Centers to improve human development and psychological well-being.  Decades of documented research on the EESystem™ shows people experience improved immune function, relief from pain, detoxification, elevated moods, increased energy, and much more.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

With carefully curated books and gifts, and adjoining the Coffee Bazaar, owner Michael Rex has created a comfortable, inclusive space for everything from casual browsing to letter writing workshops to free ESL classes to local events. This gem of a local bookstore is all in for helping the community thrive with books, writing, education, and gatherings.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Each team consists of three drivers, reinforcing the endurance format’s emphasis on shared responsibility and race management. Staying true to its arrive-and-drive model, Formula KFX will supply all karts, tires and fuel as part of the $695 entry fee \\(per round\\), eliminating the need for teams to own or maintain equipment. Drivers are required to bring their own helmet, racing suit, gloves and shoes. A neck brace is mandatory for all drivers under 18, and rib protectors are strongly recommended. The series opens Feb. 15 at Sonoma Raceway Karting Center before moving to Buttonwillow Raceway Park on April 26. Round 3 takes the championship to Northern Nevada Kart Club in Reno on June 28, with the finale scheduled for Aug. 16 at SMKA in Santa Maria. Spectator wristbands are required: $20 for adults, $15 for youth \\(5–17\\), and free for kids 4 and under, which are available to purchase at the event.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

With extra water beneath us, we’re able to glide into calm, lush stretches of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly. Sit-on-top kayaks and all gear provided.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "with Kaira Jewel Lingo\n\nHow do we meet moments of overwhelm when it feels like there’s no space inside? In this half-day of mindfulness, we’ll explore body-based practices that help us stay grounded with strong emotions rather than running from them or being swept away. Through mindful breathing, walking, and listening to the body’s wisdom, we return to the steadiness of the present moment.\n\nAs we learn to tend our emotions with care, we also strengthen the inner resilience needed for the larger transformation our world is calling for. These practices help loosen patterns of fear and reactivity so we can participate in the great turning toward more life-giving ways of being together.\n\nDrawing on Buddhist psychology, together we’ll learn to recognize, accept, and gently hold difficult emotions. From this compassionate presence, emotions settle, insight emerges, and new possibilities become available for both personal and collective healing.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists, Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love, paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "with Kaira Jewel Lingo\n\nHow do we meet moments of overwhelm when it feels like there’s no space inside? In this half-day of mindfulness, we’ll explore body-based practices that help us stay grounded with strong emotions rather than running from them or being swept away. Through mindful breathing, walking, and listening to the body’s wisdom, we return to the steadiness of the present moment.\n\nAs we learn to tend our emotions with care, we also strengthen the inner resilience needed for the larger transformation our world is calling for. These practices help loosen patterns of fear and reactivity so we can participate in the great turning toward more life-giving ways of being together.\n\nDrawing on Buddhist psychology, together we’ll learn to recognize, accept, and gently hold difficult emotions. From this compassionate presence, emotions settle, insight emerges, and new possibilities become available for both personal and collective healing.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

During the class, Lena will share about her experience generating colors with plants and fungi during her residency at the Eames Ranch and relay the fundamentals of the process: from foraging and gathering, to extracting color into paint. Participants will create several color charts as well as learn how to adjust hues with a variety of additives, documenting the process along the way and taking recipes home for future experimentation.\n\nAs a longtime teacher of color theory, Lena will weave broader context into the workshop, sharing a brief history of paint-making and the phenomenon behind our perception of colors in interaction, looking at the subject through multiple lenses of art, craft, science, design and environmentalism.\n\nAll materials will be supplied and are included in the workshop fee.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Her insights echo the film’s message that homeopathy is not just a theory, but a living, time-tested system used worldwide—one that invites curiosity, personal empowerment, and a more conscious relationship with health and healing.\n\nBe sure to attend the viewing of Introducing Homeopathy with us in the EESystem on February 7th!\n\nABOUT ANNIE OSBORN\n\nAnnie Osborn is a natural medicine kinesiologist and licensed acupuncturist for 25 years in Sonoma County.  She was the technical specialist for 12 years at Boericke & Tafel Homeopathic Company, where she trained health store staff in homeopathy. There she attended 35 homeopathic conferences.  Annie has a certificate in homeopathic principles and practice, and has been using homeopathy in her practice for over 30 years.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Blending surrealist comedy with epic drama, the play captures humanity’s continual struggle to endure “by the skin of our teeth”—an urgent message in today’s world of conflict and climate crisis.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Her insights echo the film’s message that homeopathy is not just a theory, but a living, time-tested system used worldwide—one that invites curiosity, personal empowerment, and a more conscious relationship with health and healing.\n\n**Be sure to attend the viewing of Introducing Homeopathy with us in the EESystem on February 7th!**\n\n**ABOUT ANNIE OSBORN**\n\nAnnie Osborn is a natural medicine kinesiologist and licensed acupuncturist for 25 years in Sonoma County.  She was the technical specialist for 12 years at Boericke & Tafel Homeopathic Company, where she trained health store staff in homeopathy. There she attended 35 homeopathic conferences.  Annie has a certificate in homeopathic principles and practice, and has been using homeopathy in her practice for over 30 years.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists, Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love, paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Welcome to the wonderful world of Tap! This class offering is for 6 weeks, Tuesdays from 11 am-12 pm, starting February 17th. This open level class is for those who wish to discover tap dance and those who wish to continue exploring. Classes will be led by Starr Hergenrather, Mindy Copeland and Gabe Copeland. A limited supply of tap shoes is available for use at the class.  Please contact us ahead of time to ensure we have the right size for you.  Participation fee is $150 for the session, $125 for OCA members.  Register  Tap Dance provides an avenue for developing coordination, balance, musicality, rhythm, and general love for movement. We will learn the basics \\(if a beginner\\) and beyond, through warm-ups, discover the language of tap dance, learn the Shim Sham, and routines that will launch you onto your own exploration of the dance form. Tap is an extremely fun and rewarding form of dance. Tap Dance originated in the 19th century through a fusion of African and Irish dance styles, becoming a unique American art form in the melting pot of New York City. It developed through percussive footwork, initially on plantations and in urban cellars, and later gained widespread popularity through minstrel shows, vaudeville, and Hollywood musicals. Innovators like  Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson , the  Nicholas Brothers , Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly to name just a few, who shaped its evolution, which continues today with new fusions in contemporary dance. May 26, Bojangle's birthday, is National Tap Dance Day. Starr Hergenrather has been teaching Theatre and Dance for over 54 years, dancing for 70 years, which is amazing since she is only 45 years old! She received her Theatre Arts and Teaching Credentials in 1971 from Denver, CO. Starr has taught theatre/creative dramatics/improvisation/dance to all ages and directed and produced theatre for many, many years. She and her family moved to Sebastopol in 1983. In 1987, she received her Dance credential and degree from SSU. Starr loves the theatre and dance and everything about them. She has performed on stage and in film throughout her teaching career. Before joining the staff at Analy in 2001 where she became the Theatre Arts Program Director and taught one dance class starting in 2010, when the high school lost its Dance instructor due to No Child Left Behind, she taught at Brookhaven School from 1990-2001 teaching a myriad of subjects, including Theatre and Dance, and Rincon Valley Junior High School from 1987-1997, as BJ Van Noy's choreographer and asst. director of her Music Program. Starr's tap mentor was a Vaudeville and later Broadway song and Dance man by the name of Jack Williams. Starr studied with Jack for almost 20 years., until his waning years. Tap, which is a magical form of dance, btw, is Starr's first dance love, next to swing, salsa, and partner dancing, and then just plain social, wild hippie dancing at concerts. Starr also teaches Private Tap Lessons for any level dancer. Starr has a studio at her home.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

This celebration welcomes the Year of the Horse, an archetype of movement, heart-led momentum, freedom, and life force (Qi)-inviting us to release stagnation and move forward in truth and alignment. Join Chris Young-Ginzburg and Heather Star for a deeply nourishing Chinese New Year Sound Healing Journey at the Energy Wave Center.

Their harmonies invite deep emotional release, remembrance, and soul-level realignment-supporting the forward-moving, heart-centered energy of the Horse year.\n\nExperience the Energy Enhancement System™ (EESystem) as you rest in this supportive scalar field. Many experience profound relaxation, cellular rejuvenation, and a gentle resetting of the body’s natural balance—amplifying the effects of sound healing and creating an ideal foundation for welcoming the New Year with vitality, clarity, and grace.\n\nSpace is limited to 14 participants to preserve the intimacy and sacredness of the circle.

THE RUNAWAY NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK - A NEW YORK TIMES READERS PICK: 100 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY WINNER OF THE 2024 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PRIZE FOR AMERICAN FICTION FROM ONE OF TIME MAGAZINE'S 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF 2024 NAMED A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY NPR/FRESH AIR, WASHINGTON POST, THE NEW YORKER, AND TIME MAGAZINE ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2023 \"A murder mystery locked inside a Great American Novel . . . Charming, smart, heart-blistering, and heart-healing.\" -Danez Smith, The New York Times Book Review \"We all need-we all deserve-this vibrant, love-affirming novel that bounds over any difference that claims to separate us.\" -Ron Charles, The Washington Post In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe's theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. As these characters' stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town's white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community-heaven and earth-that sustain us. Books available in the shop, online \\(and e-book\\), and audio.  Event website\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now? Practices: Guided movement warm-up; sensory awareness; movement exploration of stepping toward/away from a “threshold”; body mapping with paint/collage; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants identify their current state and set creative intentions for the series. Session 2 – Trials & Allies: Shadows and Strengths Theme: Meeting obstacles and discovering resources. Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight. Session 4 – Return with the Elixir: Integration & Wholeness Theme: Carrying creative insight back into everyday life. Practices: Movement exploration of “pathways of return”; creation of a triptych \\(Before / Crossing / Return\\); gallery walk and group witnessing; closing ritual with shared intentions. Outcome: Students integrate learning and leave with practical creative practices for ongoing self- discovery and stress relief. Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop greater self-awareness by exploring personal experiences through movement, art-making, and reflective writing. 2. Use creative tools for well-being, including techniques for emotional expression, personal renewal, and stress reduction. 3. Strengthen confidence and connection through supportive group activities and experiments with expressive movement and visual art.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artists, Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich present the Color of Love, paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Latin Cooking Class with Chef Carlos of Guiso Latin Fusion - 2/19\n\n$125.00\n\nJoin Sonoma Family Meal and locally-renowned chef Carlos Mojica of Guiso Latin Fusion in Healdsburg for a Latin cooking class at the Sonoma Family Meal Kitchen! The hands-on, collaborative class will last 2.5 hours, with time to enjoy your meal together at the end.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned cook or just starting out, this class will offer a fun, engaging learning environment, while raising funds for Sonoma Family Meal’s free culinary job training and food-security programs.\n\nIf you haven’t been to the SFM Kitchen yet, this class is also the perfect chance to visit and experience where the magic takes place and how the work gets done.\n\nWHEN: Thursday February 19th, 5-7:30pm WHERE: SFM community kitchen, 1370A Redwood Way, Petaluma\n\nTHE MENU: TBD\n\nABOUT THE CHEF:\n\nChef Carlos was born in El Salvador, where his passion for cooking began in the kitchen with his grandmother and mother, creating simple yet flavorful family meals. After his family migrated to the United States, Carlos worked at his uncle’s restaurant in Sebastopol, further deepening his love for food. While attending Piner High School, in Santa Rosa, he joined a newly established culinary program, where he learned professional kitchen skills and participated in local food competitions with renowned chefs like Guy Fieri and Rich Nolan. In 2008, his high school team won first place in the Santa Rosa Iron Chef competition. During this time, Carlos also took on the responsibility of cooking family meals, solidifying his dream of becoming a chef. \n\nAfter graduating, Carlos started at Jackson’s in Santa Rosa as a dishwasher but quickly worked his way up through various kitchen roles, impressing his colleagues with his dedication and skill. His hard work caught the attention of two restaurateurs, who offered him a sous chef position at their new restaurant. While thriving in this role, Carlos realized his passion for showcasing Latin cuisine and decided to pursue further education. He earned an associate degree from Santa Rosa Junior College’s culinary program and took additional courses at the Culinary Institute of America \\(CIA\\) Greystone, St. Helena focusing on pastry and butchery. Next up, Chef Carlos was the head of food development at La Tortilla Factory in Santa Rosa, creating new recipes and products. \n\nAt 24, Carlos saved $60,000 from playing in a popular, award winning family band and flipping a house with his father. In 2014, he found a small restaurant space in Healdsburg and, with his father as a partner, opened Guiso Latin Fusion on October 15, 2015. Drawing inspiration from Central and South America, Carlos built the restaurant’s reputation organically, eventually gaining recognition from a San Francisco Chronicle food writer, which propelled his success.\n\nFor Carlos, food is art, and every dish tells a story rooted in his culture and childhood. He strives to create a family-like atmosphere in his restaurant, where guests feel connected and leave with memorable experiences. Beyond running his restaurant, Carlos mentors young chefs, develops a rosé wine brand called BELI’S, and continues to “Live a Flavorful Life.” His motto, “Cook My Culture,” reflects his deep connection to his roots and his passion for creating meaningful culinary experiences.\n\nAWARDS\n\n\\+Best Chef, 2025 Healdsburg, CA Healdsburg Tribune \\+The 100 Best Restaurants in America by OpenTable 2025 \\+Multiple Diners choice Awards in 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 \\+Top 100 places to eat in U.S 2024 by Yelp\n\nReserve my spot\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Profs and Pints Napa presents: “The \\(New\\) Science of Attraction,” on psychological research that’s upending assumptions about how we pick partners, with Paul W. Eastwick, professor of psychology at the University of California Davis and author of Bonded by Evolution: The New Science of Love and Connection.\n\nOver the past few decades, a buzzy new branch of science, evolutionary psychology, has spread a deeply flawed story about romantic relationships. Cloaking itself in the language of incontrovertible Darwinian fact, it has popularized the idea that our minds have been shaped by primal drives that pit the genders against each other. It has promoted the myth that men are wired to be promiscuous and the notions that wealth, status, and beauty are the ultimate aphrodisiacs.\n\nIt’s time to say goodbye to such thinking and embrace a more-evolved view of romance, argues Paul W. Eastwick, who co-hosts the Love Factually podcast and operates a UC-Davis research lab that studies attraction and relationships.\n\nCome to Napa Yards for a talk by Dr. Eastwick that will give you a much more sophisticated understanding of matters of the heart. \n\nDrawing from pathbreaking research—including original experiments from his own lab—he’ll offer the take that relationship success hinges on compatibility rather than finding someone who meets some universal ideal of a good partner.\n\nHe’ll show that while popularity factors into first impressions, its influence fades fast. When evaluating mutual friends and acquaintances they’ve known for months, single people barely agree in their ratings of who is or isn’t desirable as a dating partner.\n\nAlthough men and women occasionally say they want different things out of romance, gender differences evaporate once we assess what men and women actually want. Attraction from ancestral times through the present is best depicted as a process of finding—and, often, creating—a compatible relationship.\n\nDr. Eastwick will show how the traits we often look for in a partner—personality, lifestyle, values, and humor—are poor predictors of compatibility. Instead, lasting attraction is built through the gradual forging of strong attachment bonds, through mundane moments in which people offer each other a “safe haven” and “secure base.”\n\nDistilling evolutionary biology, anthropology, and psychology into accessible insights, he’ll explain why we so often choose dating strategies that make us miserable and how we can use a more evolved approach. \\(Tickets available only online.

My path has been shaped by a foundation in existential philosophy and psychology, medicine circles, and a lifelong study of contemplative and esoteric traditions. Out of my own longing for community and a commitment to the needs of the moment, I am passionate about creating spaces for men to gather in honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity — places where we can face our struggles, share our truths, and remember the healing power of connection.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Each book will match a BINGO square. Hurrah! Play along with Napa Bookmine and read some new, fun books, and if you come to every meeting, you may get a BINGO in the meantime. ;\\) This month, we'll be talking about Danzy Senna's Colored Television. This is a free event, but we would appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! Questions? Email us at events@napabookmine.com ABOUT THE BOOK A NATIONAL BESTSELLER | A GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK | A WASHINGTON POST TOP 10 BOOK OF THE YEAR | A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2024 “A laugh-out-loud cultural comedy… This is the New Great American Novel, and Danzy Senna has set the standard.” –LA Times “Funny, foxy and fleet…The jokes are good, the punches land, the dialogue is tart.” – Dwight Garner, The New York Times A brilliant take on love and ambition, failure and reinvention, and the racial-identity-industrial complex from the bestselling author of Caucasia. Jane has high hopes that her life is about to turn around. After a long, precarious stretch bouncing among sketchy rentals and sublets, she and her family are living in luxury for a year, house-sitting in the hills above Los Angeles. The gig magically coincides with Jane’s sabbatical, giving her the time and space she needs to finish her second novel—a centuries-spanning epic her artist husband, Lenny, dubs her “mulatto War and Peace.” Finally, some semblance of stability and success seems to be within her grasp. But things don’t work out quite as hoped. Desperate for a plan B, like countless writers before her Jane turns her gaze to Hollywood. When she finagles a meeting with Hampton Ford, a hot producer with a major development deal at a streaming network, he seems excited to work with a “real writer,” and together they begin to develop “the Jackie Robinson of biracial comedies.” Things finally seem to be going right for Jane—until they go terribly wrong. Funny, piercing, and page turning, Colored Television is Senna’s most on-the-pulse, ambitious, and rewarding novel yet. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Danzy Senna is the author of four previous works of fiction, including the bestselling Caucasia and, most recently, New People, as well as a memoir. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, she teaches writing at the University of Southern California.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Profs and Pints Napa presents: **“The (New) Science of Attraction,”** on psychological research that’s upending assumptions about how we pick partners, with Paul W. Eastwick, professor of psychology at the University of California Davis and author of *Bonded by Evolution: The New Science of Love and Connection.*\n\nOver the past few decades, a buzzy new branch of science, evolutionary psychology, has spread a deeply flawed story about romantic relationships. Cloaking itself in the language of incontrovertible Darwinian fact, it has popularized the idea that our minds have been shaped by primal drives that pit the genders against each other. It has promoted the myth that men are wired to be promiscuous and the notions that wealth, status, and beauty are the ultimate aphrodisiacs.\n\nIt’s time to say goodbye to such thinking and embrace a more-evolved view of romance, argues Paul W. Eastwick, who co-hosts the *Love Factually* podcast and operates a UC-Davis research lab that studies attraction and relationships.\n\nCome to Napa Yards for a talk by Dr. Eastwick that will give you a much more sophisticated understanding of matters of the heart. \n\nDrawing from pathbreaking research—including original experiments from his own lab—he’ll offer the take that relationship success hinges on compatibility rather than finding someone who meets some universal ideal of a good partner.\n\nHe’ll show that while popularity factors into first impressions, its influence fades fast.

THE RUNAWAY NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK • A NEW YORK TIMES READERS PICK: 100 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY WINNER OF THE 2024 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PRIZE FOR AMERICAN FICTION FROM ONE OF TIME MAGAZINE’S 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF 2024 NAMED A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY NPR/FRESH AIR, WASHINGTON POST, THE NEW YORKER, AND TIME MAGAZINE ONE OF BARACK OBAMA’S FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2023 “A murder mystery locked inside a Great American Novel . . . Charming, smart, heart-blistering, and heart-healing.” —Danez Smith, The New York Times Book Review “We all need—we all deserve—this vibrant, love-affirming novel that bounds over any difference that claims to separate us.” —Ron Charles, The Washington Post In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. As these characters’ stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community—heaven and earth—that sustain us. Books are available in the shop, online and ebooks at bookshop.org/shop/alibibookshop and audio: libro.fm/alibibookshop\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Mama’s Broke is a powerful folk duo that deliver a compelling performance with heart and raw energy. Although highly influenced by their Canadian roots, Lisa and Amy are based out of nowhere and everywhere. \n\nTheir two strong voices blend to create haunting harmonies, while they artfully juggle fiddle, banjo, guitar and mandolin, and incorporate traditional dance and foot percussion into their performance. Their original – and often dark – compositions push the boundaries of tradition and the constraints of genre. Drawing from old-time, Quebecois, blues, punk, Celtic, Balkan and  doom metal, they create a soundscape that is both familiar and new. \n\nSince forming the band in 2014, Mama’s Broke has been gaining momentum fast ; having already completed two European, and several Canadian and U.S. tours. They have performed in a wide range of venues, from circus shows in New Orleans, to pirate ships in Amsterdam, to concert halls in Ireland, to theatres in Brooklyn. In this way, they stay true to the transient nature of folklore, as they travel the world sharing and collecting song.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket.

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "PETALUMA -- Copperfield's Books welcomes friend and beloved local author Eirinie Carson to Petaluma for the launch of her hypnotic new Gothic thriller - Bloodfire, Baby: A Novel! Join us for a chilling reading and discussion followed by an audience Q&A and book signing with photo opportunities. This is a free event, registration required due to limited seating. A maternal gothic tale of new motherhood and the torment of a centuries-old haunting Before the shadow appeared, Sofia thought mothering would be all sun-drenched light and white linen sheets, as seen advertised by the momfluencers of Instagram. In her gorgeous home anchored in a posh suburb, far removed from her origins, Sofia revels in her success. Motherhood seems like the natural next step, but when her husband travels for a work trip, leaving Sofia all alone with their unnamed three-week-old baby, she can't quite square how mothering falls solely in her lap. Nobody seems able or willing to help her: not her husband, not her best friend, and certainly not the zealot mother she cut off long ago. Her postpartum reality is overtaken by an ominous figure. Sleep-deprivation collides with a darkness that creeps in and begins to spread, threatening to consume her entirely. As her grip on reality slips away, Sofia learns of an insidious haunting that has plagued the eldest daughters in her family for generations. With her baby's safety on the line, Sofia realizes she must confront her murky history or risk losing more than just the veneer of perfection. Author: Eirinie Carson is a member of the Writers Grotto in San Francisco and a frequent contributor to Mother magazine. Her work has also appeared in LitHub, Notre Dame Review, Mortal Mag, Electric Literature, The Sonora Review, and others. Bloodfire, Baby is her first novel. Praise: ‘Eirinie Carson's BLOODFIRE, BABY arrives kicking and screaming with flames in its hair and lightning in its hands as it heralds a new powerful literary voice being born. Raw, honest, mysterious and ultimately courageous, BLOODIFRE, BABY is the book that will peel away your misconceptions and lay bare the power and the beauty of the feminine mystique. Not to be missed.' -S.A. Cosby author of King of Ashes ‘BLOODFIRE, BABY is a ferocious, hypnotic descent that burrows under your skin and refuses to let go. Carson expertly plunges us into the sleepless, paranoid depths of new motherhood where ancestral ghosts collide with the present-day terror of a negotiable reality. A fever dream, a psychological thriller, and a whip smart commentary on modern motherhood, BLOODFIRE, BABY is destined to be a novel people press into each other's hands, whispering 'you have to read this.'-Chelsea Bieker, author of Madwoman ‘The most nuanced examination of postpartum I have ever read, BLOODFIRE, BABY spans continents and generations in its kaleidoscopic portrayal of motherhood, race, and class. Rarely is a novel as propulsive as it is illuminating, but this is uncannily infused with a heavy, knowing dread that intensifies with each turn of the page. That expert pacing--along with the novel's exquisite language, depth, and scope--announces Eirinie Carson as a refreshing and essential new voice in contemporary fiction.' -Margaret Wilkerson Sexton, author of On The Rooftop ‘BLOODFIRE, BABY is a novel of crackling honesty, daring, and vigor that only a mother could write. Carson's relentless, page-turning plot weaves the frank, uninhibited sensualities of motherhood and body horror into a thick, powerful rope, then ties you tightly to the page right alongside our heroine. Carson's novel is a wild, transformative ride written in neon from the first page to the last. Yes, only a mother could create this haunting, mighty book, but everyone must read it.' --Savala Nolan, Don't Let it Get You Down: Essays on Race, Gender, and the Body\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

From his humble beginnings as a street performer, to being featured on the \\#1 rated show in the USA – Dancing With The Stars. Guitarist and creative force behind the event, Benise, comments “I wanted to push the boundaries of Nuevo Flamenco/Spanish guitar while combining the elements of dance and theater. This show is a celebration of all the shows we’ve done over the last 25 years.” \n\nThe Emmy Award-winning composer along with an international cast of musicians and dancers will entertain audiences with a two-hour show that “is an escape from all of their problems,” Benise says. Beyond the new material, Benise says “the live show will incorporate some fan favorites from my street performing days and rock classics like Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.” In addition, Benise adds his signature touch to classics such as “Ave Maria, “Moonlight Sonata,” and Vivaldi’s “Summer” from The Four Seasons.\n\nBenise adds, “This is a great show for the whole family; I really think we have something for everyone. I hope people will be inspired by our story, by the music, by the production--and have the passion to follow their own dreams.” \n\nThe Theatrical World Music and Dance spectacle that has been called “The Latin Riverdance” \n\n‘The Prince of Spanish Guitar’  - Dancing With The Stars\n\n‘Bennissimo!’ - Chicago News\n\n‘Extreme Flamenco Fusion’ - Screen India\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Almaas)\n\nExperience an exploration of the spiritual journey as a path of love, where the heart’s discontent becomes the doorway to ultimate fulfillment.\n\nAlthough the heart seeks fulfillment in people, possessions, and experiences, no external love can truly satisfy our deepest longing. Our discontent is an opportunity—a sacred invitation to turn inward. True fulfillment arises only when we empty our hearts to make space for the formless and intangible inner Beloved that is our true nature.\n\nJoin A. H. Almaas, founder of the Ridhwan School and the Diamond Approach, on a transformative journey of the heart. Discover how the search for love leads us through emptiness into a luminous darkness—a place where the mind is confounded, but the heart awakens to a passionate love for the unknown and to its potential for resting into the deepest fulfillment possible.\n\nThis half-day program is based on the new book, *The Inner Beloved: The Heart’s Journey to Divine Unity (Shambhala, 2026)*. Copies of the book will be available for purchase at the bookstore, and onsite participants may have their copy of the book signed.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Almaas\\)\n\nExperience an exploration of the spiritual journey as a path of love, where the heart’s discontent becomes the doorway to ultimate fulfillment.\n\nAlthough the heart seeks fulfillment in people, possessions, and experiences, no external love can truly satisfy our deepest longing. Our discontent is an opportunity—a sacred invitation to turn inward. True fulfillment arises only when we empty our hearts to make space for the formless and intangible inner Beloved that is our true nature.\n\nJoin A. H. Almaas, founder of the Ridhwan School and the Diamond Approach, on a transformative journey of the heart. Discover how the search for love leads us through emptiness into a luminous darkness—a place where the mind is confounded, but the heart awakens to a passionate love for the unknown and to its potential for resting into the deepest fulfillment possible.\n\nThis half-day program is based on the new book, The Inner Beloved: The Heart’s Journey to Divine Unity \\(Shambhala, 2026\\). Copies of the book will be available for purchase at the bookstore, and onsite participants may have their copy of the book signed.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

When we are writing from “reality,” how do we guide readers’ emotions in the direction of the story? In this presentation, we’ll examine work by accomplished authors and our own writing for ways to paint vividly with words, enliven narrative, and awaken readers’ awareness through sensory details within a realm of sensory information that says “these characters, this place, this time, this story.”\n\nAbout the Presenter:Christine Walker is a visual artist and author of the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird” \\(Sibylline Press\\) and the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life” \\(Warner Books\\), and co-author and illustrator of the children’s book “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater.” She has an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

When we are writing from “reality,” how do we guide readers’ emotions in the direction of the story? In this presentation, we’ll examine work by accomplished authors and our own writing for ways to paint vividly with words, enliven narrative, and awaken readers’ awareness through sensory details within a realm of sensory information that says “these characters, this place, this time, this story.”\n\n**About the Presenter:**Christine Walker is a visual artist and author of the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird” (Sibylline Press) and the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life” (Warner Books), and co-author and illustrator of the children’s book “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater.” She has an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary.

Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Laura Roney’s Dance!, a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Naturalization records can provide valuable information such as a person’s date of  birth and location, occupation, immigration year, marital status, spouse information, witnesses' names and addresses. Naturalization and the individual steps to citizenship could be done at any “court of record” in the United States.\n\n Christine is the Program Director of the Whittier Area Genealogical Society. She is also a member of the Tualatin Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames and the Association of Professional Genealogists.  Her interest in genealogy began in 1977 with the airing of the TV mini-series “Roots”. Her enthusiasm was piqued when she was given a typed pedigree chart, commissioned by her maternal grandfather, of their Dutch heritage from the New Netherlands in the 1650’s.\n\nFREE\n\n Via ZOOM\n\n Register at **https://www.scgsonline.org**\n\n Registration closes Friday, February 20th\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Come brave the perilous waters of Point Reyes and join us for a rollicking good time at Point Reyes National Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Please bring your arsenal of sea chanteys, any musical instruments you'd like, and a willingness to laugh a lot!  It's so much fun when audience members lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus, and leading a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea chantey radio station and hear what's out there! Practice lyrics! Teach the chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal, mellow, and supportive, so if you've been wanting to push your comfort edge and lead a song, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather just singalong with the chantey choruses, that's fine too. We always have a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of all levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys, there may be lyrics that are not appropriate for children. Reservations not required. To be added to the notification email list for future singalong dates, please email pore\\_info@nps.gov For more information, please visit: nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/calendar.htm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

It’s a dynamic, behind-the-scenes experience that blends wine, storytelling and hands-on artistry.\n\nPerfect for curious wine lovers and anyone looking for a memorable wine country experience.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

He became initiated into the rich tradition of hindustani classical music as a sitarist under the legendary Ustad Aashish Khan. Will has since become a shining expression of this tradition with international performances in the realm of traditional sitar. As a kid, Will had an insatiable curiosity for exploring the world's music. He found profound depth in the traditional music of the world and nurtured that itch by studying World Music Performance at the California institute of the Arts, completing his World Music performance MFA in 2013. Since then, Will's musical journey has been rich and diverse. He believes passionately that music is essential to all of humanity. Hearing the rich tapestry of melody for sitar, guitar, cello, saxophone and tabla in the Integration Ensemble connects audiences to the richness of the world's traditions in a vibrant, fresh expression of humanity's greatest gift, music!

En 2008 consolidó su éxito al colocar tres de sus álbumes en el Top 100 de ventas, según Soundscan y Billboard, logrando múltiples premios, incluyendo Discos de Platino y el reconocimiento como Mejor Grupo de Tierra Caliente. \n\nEn esta nueva etapa Humberto Plancarte, busca brindar a sus fanáticos una nueva propuesta musical, mezclando las raíces del regional mexicano con arreglos musicales orquestados, baladas, cumbias y el icónico sabor de Tierra Caliente, apostando por sus letras honestas y románticas que veneran el amor. \n\nHumberto Plancarte, originally from Rancho Las Juntas de Poturo in the municipality of Churumuco, Michoacán, began his musical career in 1998 with the goal of leaving a lasting legacy with his audience. Two years later, in 2000, he founded the group Tierra Cali. \n\nHumberto became known for revitalizing música grupera, blending elements of norteño, banda, tropical rhythms, and more to create a unique sound that proudly represents Mexican culture. In 2008, he solidified his success by placing three of his albums in the Top 100 sales charts, according to SoundScan and Billboard, earning multiple awards, including “Discos de Platino” and the title of Best Tierra Caliente Group. \n\nNow entering a new chapter in his career, Humberto Plancarte offers fans a fresh musical proposal that fuses the roots of Regional Mexican music with orchestral arrangements, ballads, cumbias, and the iconic Tierra Caliente flavor—anchored in honest, romantic lyrics that celebrate love. \n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\n\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The current West County Museum in downtown Sebastopol was the terminal.  Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14,000 railroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set of artifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transportation, manufacturing, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad industry since 1956, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pacific Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum, Fred often ran P&SR passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junction, the only remaining operating car from that railroad.\n\nThis talk is a project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society. It will be preceded by a short update by the society board about what is happening at the Historical Society.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Local watercolor artist and college instructor, Barbara Marlin, creator of the Daphne Lifts Up book cover will display the original artwork and selected prints of other work at the event. Following the readings and music, a Q&A will follow, with book sales and signing in the lobby. Refreshments will be available for sale. This is free event, all donations always gratefully accepted.    Donna Emerson divides her time between Petaluma, California, and her family homestead near Ithaca, New York. Retired from teaching at Santa Rosa Jr. College and her clinical social work practice, her recent poetry publications include La Pressa, The Paterson Literary Review, and Weber: The Contemporary West. Her chapbooks: This Water, 2007, Body Rhymes, 2009, Wild Mercy, 2011, and Following Hay, 2013. Her poetry books are The Place of Our Meeting \\(Finishing Line Press, 2018\\) and Beside the Well \\(Cherry Grove Collections. 2019\\). And now, Daphne Lifts Up \\(Finishing Line Press, 2025\\). Donna has received two nominations for the Pushcart Prize, one for \"Best of the Net,\" two nominations for the California Book Award \\(Body Rhymes, 2009, The Place of Our Meeting, 2018\\), five awards from the annual Allen Ginsberg Contests, and numerous regional awards for her poetry, creative non-fiction, and prose. Many of her poems appear in journals or anthologies with her black and white or color photography. Anais Nin used Donna's portraits of Anais in her late diaries and press coverage in the New York Times.  Donna has taught poetry to elementary school children and made it part of her community college classrooms \\(1990-2015\\). She worked as a volunteer with Alzheimer's patients at a residential facility to help them create individual and group poems and served as Board member and Events Chair for the Marin Poetry Center \\(2012-2014\\). Donna's latest book, \"Daphne Lifts Up\" includes poems about nature around us, nature within us, and relationships with many different people, from family to counseling clients, to students, colleagues at work, animals, birds, and strangers. It addresses birth, illness, death, and resiliency in all these verses.    Gerald Fleming is the author of the poetry collections The Bastard and the Bishop \\(Hanging Loose Press, 2021\\), One \\(Hanging Loose, 2016\\), The Choreographer \\(Sixteen Rivers Press, 2013\\), Night of Pure Breathing \\(Hanging Loose, 2011\\), and Swimmer Climbing onto Shore \\(Sixteen Rivers, 2005\\). His work has appeared in many magazines over the decades, including New Letters, Michigan Quarterly Review, Hanging Loose, Carolina Quarterly, New World Writing, Volt, Paris Lit Up, and Versal.  Fleming edited the print magazines Barnabe Mountain Review and Forward to Velma, the vitreous magazine One \\(More\\) Glass, and The Collected Poetry & Prose of Lawrence Fixel \\(Sixteen Rivers, 2021\\). He has written numerous books for teachers, including Rain, Steam, and Speed \\(Jossey-Bass/Wiley, 2005\\), and lives most of the year near San Francisco, part of the year in Paris. Fleming, a master of the prose poem, is never satisfied to sing the same song, and this adventuresome spirit pays dividends in these new prose poems. Constantly surprising and inventive,  The Bastard and the Bishop offers stories within stories that effortlessly merge the personal and the archetypal, breathing new life into a genre that has increasingly, and often sadly, become predictable.     Jared Emerson-Johnson is a video game music composer, sound designer, voice director and voice actor. He is the Music Supervisor and lead composer at Bay Area Sound, an audio production company specializing in sound design, music a\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

The current West County Museum in downtown Sebastopol was the terminal.  Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14,000 railroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set of artifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transportation, manufacturing, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad industry since 1956, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pacific Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum, Fred often ran P&SR passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junction, the only remaining operating car from that railroad.\n\nThis talk is a project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society. It will be preceded by a short update by the society board about what is happening at the Historical Society.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

From his humble beginnings as a street performer, to being featured on the \\#1 rated show in the USA – Dancing With The Stars. Guitarist and creative force behind the event, Benise, comments “I wanted to push the boundaries of Nuevo Flamenco/Spanish guitar while combining the elements of dance and theater. This show is a celebration of all the shows we’ve done over the last 25 years.” \n\nThe Emmy Award-winning composer along with an international cast of musicians and dancers will entertain audiences with a two-hour show that “is an escape from all of their problems,” Benise says. Beyond the new material, Benise says “the live show will incorporate some fan favorites from my street performing days and rock classics like Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.” In addition, Benise adds his signature touch to classics such as “Ave Maria, “Moonlight Sonata,” and Vivaldi’s “Summer” from The Four Seasons.\n\nBenise adds, “This is a great show for the whole family; I really think we have something for everyone. I hope people will be inspired by our story, by the music, by the production--and have the passion to follow their own dreams.” \n\nThe Theatrical World Music and Dance spectacle that has been called “The Latin Riverdance” \n\n‘The Prince of Spanish Guitar’  - Dancing With The Stars\n\n‘Bennissimo!’ - Chicago News\n\n‘Extreme Flamenco Fusion’ - Screen India\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

From virtually invisible colonies of aggregating anemones to sea stars tucked under kelp, there are fragile intertidal creatures everywhere.\n\nTidepool education volunteers teach school and adult groups how to safely observe and interact with the fascinating life forms of the intertidal zone. Participants learn about the importance of protecting the fragile plants and animals that inhabit this special ecosystem. Tidepool Roving volunteers stationed on beaches during low tides provide park visitors with a safe and educational experience exploring the tidepools. Additionally, docents provide interpretation when our Touch Table is featured at events or along the coast.\n\nNo experience necessary! As a new volunteer, you will shadow experienced volunteers until you feel comfortable on your own.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on **Monday February 23 for part one of our two-part training**\n\n**Part 1 of the training: Monday February 23  6 – 8pm on zoom**\n\n**Part 2 of the training: *Field Visit* Sunday March 1 from** **3 – 5 PM at Campbell Cove, Bodega Head, Sonoma Coast State Park Map to Campbell Cove**\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Play D&D, build community, and grow empathy through weekly storytelling sessions.\n\nAbout the class\n\nclass descriptionAdventure Gaming classes presented by The Game Academy are held weekly for 2-hour sessions over an 8-week term. Participating players explore collaborative storytelling in a mentorship model using games like Dungeons & Dragons to build community, foster empathy, and support social-emotional growth. Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school. More more information, please contact Melissa Agocs at melissa@sonomacommunitycenter.org.\n\nMembership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this webinar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts, and probate\n\nProtecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims\n\nMost living trusts fail; if you already have a trust, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones\n\nHow to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n\nHow to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan \\($425 value\\).\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Creating your estate plan, whether it’s a living trust or a will, can be a daunting task.  Estate planning addresses issues that are difficult to think about, such as death, incapacity, finances, and family dynamics.  It can be easy to procrastinate, even though these issues may weigh heavily on your mind.\n\nWe invite you to attend one of our upcoming free webinars so you can take the first step toward having peace of mind by creating (or updating) your estate plan.  This is an educational webinar, where we highlight some of the concerns that many families face and how an estate plan can help.  The attorneys also break down how wills and trusts differ, and some of the common estate planning pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the education you need to protect yourself and your family, and leave a legacy of peace. If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\n**At this webinar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:**\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts, and probate\n\nProtecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims\n\nMost living trusts fail; if you already have a trust, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones\n\nHow to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n\nHow to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan ($425 value).\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now? Practices: Guided movement warm-up; sensory awareness; movement exploration of stepping toward/away from a “threshold”; body mapping with paint/collage; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants identify their current state and set creative intentions for the series. Session 2 – Trials & Allies: Shadows and Strengths Theme: Meeting obstacles and discovering resources. Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight. Session 4 – Return with the Elixir: Integration & Wholeness Theme: Carrying creative insight back into everyday life. Practices: Movement exploration of “pathways of return”; creation of a triptych \\(Before / Crossing / Return\\); gallery walk and group witnessing; closing ritual with shared intentions. Outcome: Students integrate learning and leave with practical creative practices for ongoing self- discovery and stress relief. Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop greater self-awareness by exploring personal experiences through movement, art-making, and reflective writing. 2. Use creative tools for well-being, including techniques for emotional expression, personal renewal, and stress reduction. 3. Strengthen confidence and connection through supportive group activities and experiments with expressive movement and visual art.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "February 26-28, 2026\n\nSt Columba’s Writing and Spirituality Series presents Be Not Afraid: Finding Words that Equip us for the Moment. This spring in-person writing retreat led by Marilyn MacEntyre follows her successful online workshops and in-person retreats in 2023-25.\n\nWe are delighted to invite you to her 2026 spring offering, this retreat will run February 26-28 2026, 4:00 pm Thursday through 3:00 pm Saturday.\n\nEscalating political conflict, a polarized economy, ongoing warfare, and climate anxieties give us plenty of occasion to come face to face with our fears. We may have to dig deeper for hope these days, but we know where to find it. In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how \"Be not afraid\" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation, and how even in the midst of troubles, both public and personal, we can help each other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both our own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will focus on experiences of fear, courage, consolation, and resilience in the historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nMarilyn McEntyre, writer and longtime professor of literature, coaches writers and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley, Western Theological Seminary and the Oblate School of Theology. Her books include Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies, When Poets Pray, and Speaking Peace in a Climate of Conflict. A new book about writing, Start With a Word, is coming out in February 2026 and can be pre-ordered at eerdmans.com. See more, and contact her, at marilynmcentyre.com.\n\nCost: $295-$695 depending on choices about lodging/commuting\n\nPartial scholarships available \n\nRegister at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/be-not-afraid\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

In this presentation, Firuze shares her creative process of transforming whale songs, spectrograms, and real marine research into vibrant visual art. Through the true stories of individual whales and the scientific discoveries behind her pieces, she explores how storytelling can spark emotional connection and drive conservation action. This talk invites audiences to listen more deeply to the ocean, understand the lives of the whales who inhabit it, and discover the power of art as a voice for the natural world.\n\nFiruze Gokce reached a significant milestone with the debut of her first solo art exhibition on May 23rd, showcasing her \"Whale Sounds on a Canvas\" collection. This exhibition featured her prints and immersive videos that blended visual art with the auditory experience of whale songs, offering a multi-sensory exploration of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally, her piece \"Brave Little Hunter\" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island, highlighting her ability to convey the emotional depth of the natural world. Firuze was also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in October 2024, further solidifying her place in the art community. Her artwork “Diving into the Depths of the Ocean” received an “Honorary Mention Award” from the Marine Society of Artists.\n\nGuests are welcome to arrive early and enjoy Firuze Gokce’s art exhibit, Whale Sounds on a Canvas II, currently on view at the Laguna Environmental Center from January 10 – April 24, 2026.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

    "description": "Join the Laguna de Santa Rosa Foundation in welcoming artist and marine conservation advocate Firuze Gokce for an inspiring talk that blends art, science, and storytelling. In this presentation, Firuze shares her creative process of transforming whale songs, spectrograms, and real marine research into vibrant visual art. Through the true stories of individual whales and the scientific discoveries behind her pieces, she explores how storytelling can spark emotional connection and drive conservation action. This talk invites audiences to listen more deeply to the ocean, understand the lives of the whales who inhabit it, and discover the power of art as a voice for the natural world.\n\nFiruze Gokce reached a significant milestone with the debut of her first solo art exhibition on May 23rd, showcasing her \"Whale Sounds on a Canvas\" collection. This exhibition featured her prints and immersive videos that blended visual art with the auditory experience of whale songs, offering a multi-sensory exploration of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally, her piece \"Brave Little Hunter\" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island, highlighting her ability to convey the emotional depth of the natural world. Firuze was also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in October 2024, further solidifying her place in the art community. Her artwork “Diving into the Depths of the Ocean” received an “Honorary Mention Award” from the Marine Society of Artists.\n\nGuests are welcome to arrive early and enjoy Firuze Gokce’s art exhibit, Whale Sounds on a Canvas II, currently on view at the Laguna Environmental Center from January 10 – April 24, 2026.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

The church's Shower Ministry is open three days per week and in 2025 provided 1,164 showers. Every Tuesday the church serves a hot soup-and-bread luncheon. Food is available the other two days the Shower Ministry is open each week. And the parish hall at 209 Matheson St. is the site of Healdsburg's weekly Sunday dinner. Produced by a cooperative of seven of Healdsburg's churches, the Sunday meal traditionally served about 40 people weekly but in recent months has grown to serving 80 or more.\n\nThe cost of producing the fundraiser has been covered by sponsors. All money raised from ticket sales and the silent auction will be used for upgrading the parish hall facilities. Tickets are $125 each and are available through Eventbrite; go to www.eventbrite.com and search \"Sip Savor Serve\" for Feb. 26.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Oliver will be joined in conversation by beloved friend and local librarian, Mychal Threets. Join us for an unforgettable evening of literary insight followed by an audience Q&A and book signing with photo opportunities. All event proceeds will be donated to local non-profit and vital literacy initiative,  Read On Sonoma . This is a free event, registration required due to limited seating. Honest and thought-provoking, Unread is an inspiring, hopeful memoir of growth and change - Booklist As a result of childhood learning disabilities and educational neglect, Oliver James graduated from high school and became one of approximately 45 million functionally illiterate Americans. However, at age 32, with big dreams and few tools to actualize them, he dedicated himself to learning the key skill that had evaded him his entire life: reading. Oliver has become a TikTok/BookTok sensation for the way he's candidly documented his decision to learn to read as an adult, and his struggles and triumphs along the way. Here, he tells the full story behind his journey for the first time through the 21 key books that shaped and informed his experience. His story reveals the ways in which reading can teach each of us how to be better, more empathetic people. In just 365 days, Oliver went from barely being able to read a restaurant menu to closing in on his goal of finishing 100 books in a year. Unread is a moving reminder to all of us that words and stories have power, and that, no matter our past, it's never too late to grow. Author: Oliver James is a California-based personal trainer, motivational speaker, literacy activist, and influencer. He has been featured in or on Today, NPR, Jennifer Hudson Show, Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, Rachael Ray, and ABC News, among many others. Additionally, he is the recent recipient of the 2023 Barbara Bush National Literacy Award. He lives in Costa Mesa, California. Mychal Threets is a librarian, literary ambassador, and the library's number one fan \\(according to himself, admittedly\\). He was raised in his local library as a home-school kid and grew up in Fairfield, CA, right between Sacramento and San Francisco. Online, he shares videos of affirmations to assure people that their mental health always matters, and he encourages everyone to know they belong at the library. A former PBS kid himself, Mychal is proud to serve as PBS resident librarian.  I'm So Happy You're Here \\(coming 2/3/26\\) is his first book. His cats, Machine Gun Kitty and Kissin' Kat Barlow, did not help at all, but he still appreciates them.

Praise: \"Unread feels like both story and concordance, a good read and a great resource for others who are on their way up the mountain of literacy. But mostly, this book is a testament to human will. It's a reminder that in order to enunciate resilience, one must learn the phonetics of desire, survival, and freedom. Oliver James is a marvel.\" -Jason Reynolds, New York Times bestselling author of the Track series \"An inspiring and deeply human story about resilience, courage, and the transformative power of literacy. . . . Oliver's honest and public journey, shared with millions online, has shone a much-needed light on America's literacy crisis. . . . He not only tells his personal story but reminds us that it's never too late to learn, to dream, and to rewrite your own story.\" -Andrew Roberts, President, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy \"Oliver James is a big dreamer whose life was transformed through books-and he made the brave, bold choice to dive headfirst into wherever this would take him. . . . He's the living, breathing, thriving example of what reading can do for a person. Though Oliver found the light at the end of the tunnel, there are quite likely millions of children who are headed down the dark road he went through-but if their parents, educators, and leaders would read this memoir . . . there is still a chance to turn it all around for them, too. This raw, unfiltered deep-dive into the mind's eye of a man who has been through it all should be a must-read for educators of our at-risk youth.\" -I. C. Robledo, author of 365 Quotes to Live Your Life By \"Unread isn't just inspiration-it's motivation for each of us to become the hero of our own story. This book is a testament both to the power of reading and to the strength within all of us to overcome our greatest obstacles. Oliver James is a role model for us all.\" -Kelley Coleman, author of Everything No One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child \"A thoughtful and inspiring story about vulnerability and courage. Poignant proof that reading helps to change lives.\" -Kirkus\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

We will learn how to support scaling up our forms through drying methods, interior ‘bone’ structure, and mastering directionality with our hands. There will be a focus on how we each make a mark upon a pot, and how to do so with purpose. Each student will create work that reflects the time-honored nature of handbuilding; when intention is given to the silhouette of a form, the lip of a cup, and/or the comfort of a handle.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Bluegrass, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm, John Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seamlessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time music for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year, with seven acclaimed albums and two Juno nominations, the Jaybirds are simultaneously innovative and unadorned, sophisticated and stripped-down, happily old-fashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance, $40 at the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelchair accessible. Art gallery open during intermission, refreshments for sale.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman \"one of the world's undisputed masters\" of the mandolin, famed for outstanding tone and taste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular favourites for sessions and covers, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded on many other projects, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music with highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller; the duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bluegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary \"new acoustic\" quartet, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit, renowned for highly skilled instrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed the Jaybirds. Of their latest album, Folk Radio UK said \"On That Other Green Shore showcases an accomplished, experienced band at the peak of their powers, with musicianship of the very highest order.\" Peghead Nation called it \"one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017.\" Los Angeles, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 2017. The veteran performer has played with, among others, Doc Watson, Richard Greene, John Jorgensen, Peter Rowan, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty. He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions by Laurie Lewis, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Daylighting the Creek as \"a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the glory days of early bluegrass guitar.\" Chilliwack, BC-based Trisha Gagnon is portrayed by Sing Out! as \"one of the most versatile\" and \"irresistible\" lead vocalists in bluegrass, her strong and distinctive style ranging from \"mournful and plaintive\" to \"hopeful and yearning.\" Trisha anchors what Dirty Linen magazine calls \"gorgeous three-part harmonies.\" She's also known for songwriting, dating back to her early days with the award-winning B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gill and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his own voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contemporary banjo players. \"Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingling,\" said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\), was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015, and Nick is a composer who also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley Station on the new Jaybird album \"showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense of melody,\" said Green Man Review. Spokane, WA-based Greg Spatz is hailed as a \"world-class bluegrass fiddler\" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Audition says Greg's \"virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after time,\" while Bluegrass Unlimited says he \"lays down some seriously fine bluegrass fiddle\" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast, where he's played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield, resophonic guitar master Rob Ickes, and many others including Laurie Lewis, Bryan Bowers, and Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squirrel, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with his wife called All Along the Sea, and is an award-winning\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand-up comedy nights with one of the best standup comedians in town (in our opinion, in other people’s opinions, and soon, in your opinion too): Steve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Either way, Steve is back. He’s our main man, living-room ringmaster, and the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an MC for friends’ bands, which eventually led to his first stand-up set - a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants Pass, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead, he embraced the stage as a place for brutally honest, painfully awkward life confessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy, or very, very funny comedy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup - a proud Midwesterner now living in California, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite at The Punchline San Francisco, Cobb’s, San Jose Improv, Rooster T. Feathers, and Don’t Tell Comedy, and performs regularly at clubs and festivals across California and beyond. If sharp, witty, and hilarious is your vibe, Jalisa’s got you covered.\n\nAnd then there’s Ronn Vigh - our headliner. Ronn has written for *Fashion Police* on E! Television and performs stand-up at clubs, colleges, and venues across the country. He still dreams of becoming a weatherman (we support the dream). In the meantime, he’s an avid yogi (when not hungover), a devoted *Golden Girls* fan, and - despite being gay - a lifelong football lover.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

This event is inspired by the Japanese practice of shinrin yoku or “forest bathing.” Forest bathing is the intentional practice of slowing down and immersing oneself in the sights, sounds, smells, and sensations of the natural world in order to restore well-being and deepen our relationship with nature.\n\nThis walk will be led by Susan Karle, a Certified Forest Therapy Guide, who brings over a decade of experience guiding nature connection practices with people of all ages. Her approach integrates her background in grief and trauma work with a deep respect for the healing power of nature.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

This event is inspired by the Japanese practice of shinrin yoku or “forest bathing.” Forest bathing is the intentional practice of slowing down and immersing oneself in the sights, sounds, smells, and sensations of the natural world in order to restore well-being and deepen our relationship with nature.\n\nThis walk will be led by Susan Karle, a Certified Forest Therapy Guide, who brings over a decade of experience guiding nature connection practices with people of all ages. Her approach integrates her background in grief and trauma work with a deep respect for the healing power of nature.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.\n\nSource: Press Democrat\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s A Year to Live, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\nProgram Includes\n\nFormat: Online via Zoom \\(must know how to join a specific breakout room manually\\)\n\nTeachings: Monthly \\(12\\) large group sessions \\(attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st\\)\n\nHome Groups \\(required!\\): Monthly \\(12\\), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location \\(online or in-person\\) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\nHome practice: Guided meditations, readings, reflections \\(estimated 5-7 hours/month \\+ monthly Home Groups \\+ daily meditation\\)\n\nAccess: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\nQ&As: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded \\(optional\\)\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.\n\nSource: Press Democrat\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

With extra water beneath us, we’re able to glide into calm, lush stretches of the river that are normally out of reach.\n\nThis unhurried paddle highlights the natural beauty of the Petaluma River’s brackish, tidal waterway. Watch for great egrets, blue herons, snowy egrets, turtles basking along the banks, and abundant plant life. The calm water and peaceful surroundings create a deeply grounding experience—many guests say they feel their stress melt away within minutes.\n\nAlong the way, knowledgeable guides share stories of the river’s ecology and human history, offering insight into how this upper channel has shaped—and continues to shape—Petaluma. It’s a rare opportunity to experience how close wild nature lives to the heart of downtown.\n\nBeginner-friendly.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars, but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity and consistently delivering heartfelt, fashion-resistant music that their fans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa, California, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup were vocalist Mark Tate, guitarist Jim Cassero, bassist Jeff Barnacle, and drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same year when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf night club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest, longest-lasting, most important metal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles and being included on several important metal compilations, Vicious Rumors signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Records, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Varney. By this time, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vacated by Perkins; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for ten years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar, and bassist Dave Starr replaced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut, Soldiers of the Night, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European response. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly after Moomy's departure, but the virtuoso didn't stay long, as he was anxious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind Moore, St. Pierre was also sent packing, and the classic Digital Dictator Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert, guitarists Thorpe and Mark McGee, bassist Starr, and drummer Howe. This group would stay together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up, Digital Dictator, was released in 1988, and as the band's popularity began to grow domestically, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut for the label followed in 1990, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extensive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act, it appeared at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into the spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward trend continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang on: Live in Tokyo, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese tour. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe, the group was released from their contract with Atlantic, perhaps due not only to the band's relative inactivity, but also to the declining stateside popularity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record deals followed, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on through the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next release, Something Burning, Carl Albert died on April 22, 1995. The band decided to continue on, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally released in 1996, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by filling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European base as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-Christ While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent, the guitarist couldn't approach Albert's dexterity, and a new vocalist was needed in order for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Brian O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn, who appears on the 2001 release Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's release, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their ninth studio long-player, Warball, which saw them returning to the more traditional, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings. The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers, 2013's Electric Punishment, and 2016's Concussion Protocol.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com\n\nSource: North Bay Bohemian",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: Press Democrat\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

It has over 700 intelligently sequenced slow, conscious breath powered with precision movement variations with pause (vinyasas), exploring many aesthetic variations of each posture to correctly establish the main asanas while the mind merges with the breath.\nIncludes drishti, pratikriyas, bandha, vaseth, mudra, mantra, surya & ding namaskar with breath & mantra, cleansing kriyas, Himalayan pranayama including including ujjayi variations, heating & cooling breaths, solar, lunar & soli-lunar nadi shuddhi practices, pranava & samantraka pranayama, pratyahara, subtle & contemplative practices in 12 kramas (sequences).\n\nThe whole process gradually transforms the body and mind, releasing old patterns of physical and mental tension and dysfunctional patterns of movement, providing tonic, energetic and psychophysiological effects.

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm\n\nSource: Press Democrat\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.\n\nSource: Press Democrat",

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nI'm super excited to be able to offer another ladies' Archery night in Santa Rosa! If you've ever had a curiosity about archery, this is your chance to find out more with a fun, interactive lesson.\n\nWe have reserved a special event with the indoor range on a Wednesday evening. It will consist of a basic lesson, and then we all get to practice shooting. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment is provided by them, and we will probably get about an hour or hour and a half to practice.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy). Closed toe shoes recommended.\n\nThere are 17 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event in addition to the regular fee so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of the event. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

Come join us at 4th Street Cellars in downtown Santa Rosa. They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nJoin us for an axe-throwing session to blow off some steam. I'm super excited to be able to offer a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curiosity about this fun activity, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It will consist of an introductory lesson, and then we all get to practice taking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and targets are provided by them, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours to enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-toed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

It follows a critically lauded debut album, See You Around, and standalone singles, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene, Watkins, Jarosz, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival, then co-founded I’m With Her, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative, fable-like storytelling, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity, access, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Formed by multi-talented musician and producer Leonid Vorobyev, the group features elite vocalists and instrumentalists from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, and beyond, all united by a shared passion for celebrating this iconic era of music. \nOriginally conceived as a studio project in Moscow, Leonid & Friends skyrocketed to international fame when their note-perfect video covers went viral online, earning praise from members of Chicago themselves. What began as a YouTube phenomenon has since evolved into a world-class touring act, captivating audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. \nWith more than 500 million combined video views, multiple sold-out U.S. tours, and a devoted global fanbase, the band is beloved worldwide for honoring the classics, while expanding far beyond them \n\n\nAfter-show Meet & Greet\nMeet & Greet is a wonderful opportunity for fans to meet and interact with Leonid & Friends. Quantity is limited at each show. Shortly after the concert, attendees with a M&G wristband will be allowed to meet the band, have a group photo taken, and the opportunity to chat with band members and have merchandise or memorabilia signed.\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand.
