Based on deep breathing & the subtle movement of prana directed into the cartilage tissue, sinuous musculature, internal organs, nerve pathways and nadis. It has over 700 intelligently sequenced slow, conscious breath powered with precision movement variations with pause (vinyasas), exploring many aesthetic variations of each posture to correctly establish the main asanas while the mind merges with the breath.\nIncludes drishti, pratikriyas, bandha, vaseth, mudra, mantra, surya & ding namaskar with breath & mantra, cleansing kriyas, Himalayan pranayama including including ujjayi variations, heating & cooling breaths, solar, lunar & soli-lunar nadi shuddhi practices, pranava & samantraka pranayama, pratyahara, subtle & contemplative practices in 12 kramas (sequences).\n\nThe whole process gradually transforms the body and mind, releasing old patterns of physical and mental tension and dysfunctional patterns of movement, providing tonic, energetic and psychophysiological effects. This system is presented from the teachings Srivatsa Ramaswami learned through his over 33 years of one on one study with Sri Krishnamacharya and teachings from a similar Himalayan method.\n\nThis ongoing class will explore the entire system of 12 Kramas with each class focusing on a particular krama (sequence) & pranayama & contemplative practices.\n\nPlease practice on an empty stomach. Morning beverage ok but please take it 30min or more before class.\n\n$25 Drop In, Discounted Class Passes & Memberships\nRegister -[https://momence.com/Soft-Medicine-Sanctuary/Yoga-Vinyasa-Krama-/122789095?skipPreview=true](https://momence.com/Soft-Medicine-Sanctuary/Yoga-Vinyasa-Krama-/122789095?skipPreview=true)\n\nSource: Meetup: Nataraja Yoga",

I will email passcode to those who register.\nBe sure to enable email on MeetUp!\nThen, please check your email!\nJoin us virtually for an hour + of writing using Zoom. Let's keep together as much as we can during these uncertain times and keep on writing. Look for the schedule online and join us.\n\nWe’ve discovered that it’s strikingly helpful to write with other writers. See if it’s true for you at 3pm on Friday afternoon. Be it a book, blog, script, essay, dissertation, resume, melody, poem or just plain work stuff, you are invited to write it with us.

We invite participants to create a portrait of their beloved pet, under the guidance of an experienced Teaching Artist, with proceeds shared between SebArts and the Humane Society of Sonoma County. The event will blend creativity and compassion - core values shared by both organizations. Paint Your Pet is a 3 hour guided painting workshop where participants bring a photo of their pet (or choose from adoptable pets featured by the Humane Society) and learn to create a custom portrait using watercolor paint. Celebrate the human animal bond through art and creative expression while raising funds to support SebArts art programs and the Humane Society of Sonoma County’s animal care and adoption services.About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Revision takes time, skill, caring, and fortitude. It asks that we be generous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not for the faint of heart, but for writers committed to their relationship with creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows writers to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll share a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling,” which incorporates my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction, memoir, and nonfiction. The session includes a craft presentation, group discussion, and writing time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful revision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revision• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind• Fiction or nonfiction free write, early draft, or manuscript in progress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and revision challenges to discuss, particularly as relate to the session focusThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each time. Check the schedule, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist, author, and strategic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolution: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and, for publication in 2027, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired her to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling, Nine Ways to Mastery, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their writing practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career, she’s found that resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resilience to teaching revision as a writing skill, as well as a practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

Based on deep breathing & the subtle movement of prana directed into the cartilage tissue, sinuous musculature, internal organs, nerve pathways and nadis. It has over 700 intelligently sequenced slow, conscious breath powered with precision movement variations with pause (vinyasas), exploring many aesthetic variations of each posture to correctly establish the main asanas while the mind merges with the breath.\nIncludes drishti, pratikriyas, bandha, vaseth, mudra, mantra, surya & ding namaskar with breath & mantra, cleansing kriyas, Himalayan pranayama including including ujjayi variations, heating & cooling breaths, solar, lunar & soli-lunar nadi shuddhi practices, pranava & samantraka pranayama, pratyahara, subtle & contemplative practices in 12 kramas (sequences).\n\nThe whole process gradually transforms the body and mind, releasing old patterns of physical and mental tension and dysfunctional patterns of movement, providing tonic, energetic and psychophysiological effects. This system is presented from the teachings Srivatsa Ramaswami learned through his over 33 years of one on one study with Sri Krishnamacharya and teachings from a similar Himalayan method.\n\nThis ongoing class will explore the entire system of 12 Kramas with each class focusing on a particular krama (sequence) & pranayama & contemplative practices.\n\nPlease practice on an empty stomach. Morning beverage ok but please take it 30min or more before class.\n\n$25 Drop In, Discounted Class Passes & Memberships\nRegister -[https://momence.com/Soft-Medicine-Sanctuary/Yoga-Vinyasa-Krama-/122789095?skipPreview=true](https://momence.com/Soft-Medicine-Sanctuary/Yoga-Vinyasa-Krama-/122789095?skipPreview=true)\n\nSource: Meetup: Nataraja Yoga",

Come join us at 4th Street Cellars in downtown Santa Rosa. They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

Be it a book, blog, script, essay, dissertation, resume, melody, poem or just plain work stuff, you are invited to write it with us. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice. Instead of just thinking about writing, come and get some real writing done.\n\nJOIN US!\n\n1. RSVP - space is limited to 12 people. (registration closes at one half hour before the event starts). You will receive the link to access the event at that time. REMEMBER TO CHECK YOUR EMAIL FOR PASSCODE!\n2. Before or at 3pm join the meeting with the link you receive AND ADD PASSCODE.\n\nPlease note:\n\n1. If you don't have Zoom set up on your computer yet, leave 15-30 minutes ahead of time to get it set up!\n2. If you have difficulty with audio (don't have a microphone set up), as long as you have a speaker, you can call in (you'll see phone numbers when you log in).\n3. If you are late, you won't be able to intro with us, but you are still welcome to join in.\n4.

The word collage comes from the French verb coller, meaning \"to glue,\" and is all about merging various materials to tell a visual story. Much like our lives, which are shaped by countless moments and experiences, collage pieces bring together fragments that reveal hidden connections and untold narratives. In this class, you’ll reflect on what matters most to you and how that can be expressed through art. Catherine will help you release the need for perfection and trust your creative instincts. By the end of the workshop, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but also a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for the art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your personal story in your art, Methods for sourcing interesting collage papers, Techniques for crafting textured, multi-layered collages, Strategies for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life, copies of photos, old letters, books, papers from memorable experiences or travels, or documents that hold meaning. If you’re not comfortable using these documents, you should make color copies of them. For this process, it is also best to make laser copies of your photographs.Supplies provided by instructor: some collage papers, acrylic medium, brushesCLICK HERE TO READ DOCUMENT PRIOR TO PURCHASING CLASSAbout the instructor: Catherine Cruz is a French-American artist whose work is informed by the textures and patterns created by the passing of time and the effects of the natural elements on the built environment.

If you find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring, you can sign up for the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

Based on deep breathing & the subtle movement of prana directed into the cartilage tissue, sinuous musculature, internal organs, nerve pathways and nadis. It has over 700 intelligently sequenced slow, conscious breath powered with precision movement variations with pause (vinyasas), exploring many aesthetic variations of each posture to correctly establish the main asanas while the mind merges with the breath.\nIncludes drishti, pratikriyas, bandha, vaseth, mudra, mantra, surya & ding namaskar with breath & mantra, cleansing kriyas, Himalayan pranayama including including ujjayi variations, heating & cooling breaths, solar, lunar & soli-lunar nadi shuddhi practices, pranava & samantraka pranayama, pratyahara, subtle & contemplative practices in 12 kramas (sequences).\n\nThe whole process gradually transforms the body and mind, releasing old patterns of physical and mental tension and dysfunctional patterns of movement, providing tonic, energetic and psychophysiological effects. This system is presented from the teachings Srivatsa Ramaswami learned through his over 33 years of one on one study with Sri Krishnamacharya and teachings from a similar Himalayan method.\n\nThis ongoing class will explore the entire system of 12 Kramas with each class focusing on a particular krama (sequence) & pranayama & contemplative practices.\n\nPlease practice on an empty stomach.

Bring a copy of your receipt at check-in to Painting/Drawing Studio adjacent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly, heart-centered gathering where we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of compassion, protection, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and echoed across many cultures, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and all who have passed, those in transition, and those in distress.This ongoing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war, with a special focus now on the approximately 19,000 children who have perished in Israel and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple, meditative act of working with clay, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public exhibits and peace sites, offering spaces for reflection, mourning, and hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each month at SebArts, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to ages 12 - adult, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.There is no fee for this class; donations are welcome to help cover materials and expenses. More than a class, this is a shared space of warmth and care—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor: Judith Redwing Keyssar, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator, end-of-life doula, author, poet, song-writer, ceremonialist, national presenter and frequent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. Redwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Education in Palliative Care at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Her professional career includes being the Clinical Director at Zen Hospice Project and the Director of Palliative Care and Nursing at Jewish Family and Children’s Services from 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California State University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care, and has taught courses at OLLI at Sonoma State. Redwing is the author of an award-winning book, “Last Acts of Kindness; Lessons for the Living from the Bedsides of the Dying” and is the recipient of numerous awards in the field of Palliative Care. After studying with John Fox at the Institute for Poetic Medicine, her passion for using poetry as a healing modality has led to the development of a successful international program in Poetic Medicine, through her work at the UCSF MERI Center.

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nI'm super excited to be able to offer another ladies' Archery night in Santa Rosa! If you've ever had a curiosity about archery, this is your chance to find out more with a fun, interactive lesson.\n\nWe have reserved a special event with the indoor range on a Wednesday evening. It will consist of a basic lesson, and then we all get to practice shooting. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment is provided by them, and we will probably get about an hour or hour and a half to practice.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy). Closed toe shoes recommended.\n\nThere are 17 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event in addition to the regular fee so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of the event. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

Each session will start with a demonstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces that might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are freeform coil pots, soft slab work, hard slab technique, a variety of sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping, carving and textural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips and glaze that will add color to the forms we create.About the Instructor: Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After his college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick, he ran a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Turkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-12 art, including Ceramics, Drawing, Photography, Design and Sculpture at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High School and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of these schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teachers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the experimental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help students explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

Instruction will cover the basics of wheel throwing, hand-building (slab, coil, freeform), and glazing techniques. Students will also have unstructured time to work on their own creations.The class will explore the benefits of letting go of the need to be productive and \"perfect\". The main goal of this course is to familiarize students with how clay rooms work and why they’re a fun place to be.About the Instructor: Alice Rathjen has over 40 years experience working with clay. She was a production potter for five years. The current focus of her “art” is the sheer pleasure of playful engagement with clay. She enjoys throwing exquisite bowls, mugs and cups and seeing them go on adventures.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

Using scissors we will remove parts of the boxes until we have what we will use as our cover. Then using miscellaneous papers we fold these into the pages of our journals. With simple book-binding skills using a needle and waxed thread we will stitch the pages into our covers. We will also decorate the covers of our journals with collage papers and/or paint.Examples of completed journals will be shown and step by step instruction will be provided along with all supplies. Short exercises to boost your creativity, journal prompts, and a small gift from me are also included.Whether you are a beginning or seasoned artist/writer/crafter or just looking to try something new, this is a great way to get inspired and create something meaningful to you.About the Instructor: Rendell Hourigan received a BBA in Marketing from Texas Tech University, and has pursued art for over 25 years, focusing on sustainable mixed media. She has studied with artists including Chery Baird, Jenny London, and Teri Sloat, exploring drawing, collage, and soft pastels. Her training includes workshops and courses in art journaling, mosaics, and mark-making. She’s exhibited work at the Sebastopol Center for the Arts, The Graton Gallery, and her SOFA district studio. Drawn to the beauty of discarded materials and passionate about recycling, she incorporates reclaimed materials into her work and now leads art workshops to inspire eco-conscious creativity in others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

Come join us at 4th Street Cellars in downtown Santa Rosa. They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart\n\nSource: Sebastopol Center for the Arts",

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nJoin us for an axe-throwing session to blow off some steam. I'm super excited to be able to offer a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curiosity about this fun activity, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It will consist of an introductory lesson, and then we all get to practice taking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and targets are provided by them, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours to enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-toed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",

We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged.

Duets set a milestone in Billboard Chart history because, with the CD, Anka became the only artist to have a CD on the Billboard Top 100 Chart for seven consecutive decades. \nAt 81 years old, Paul Anka continues to write and record. His latest two albums, Making Memories and Sessions, were released in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The albums featured new and never-before recorded songs as well as new takes on old classics, notably “Put Your Head On My Shoulder,” with Olivia Newton John, one of her last recorded songs, and “My Way,” featuring Michael Buble and Andrea Bocelli. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

It follows a critically lauded debut album, See You Around, and standalone singles, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene, Watkins, Jarosz, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival, then co-founded I’m With Her, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative, fable-like storytelling, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity, access, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Come join us at 4th Street Cellars in downtown Santa Rosa. They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!\n\nSource: Meetup: Women's Wine Club",
