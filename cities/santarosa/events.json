Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

    "description": "Rosicrucians AMORC, Santa Rosa, CA\nA focal point of the Rosicrucian teachings is mysticism, the conscious union of the self with the Divine or God. The centrality of mysticism to our Order is reflected in the very name of our Order, Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis. An evolving personal conception and realization of the Divine is part of the spiritual journey of Rosicrucian students, reflected in the Rosicrucian invocation, “God of our Heart, God or our Realization.” During this teleconference, Julian Johnson will lead us in exploring the dominant conceptions of the Divine which are presented in the earliest monographs of the Rosicrucian studies, in addition to the Rosicrucian conception of the Divine or Absolute. We will also look at how modern neuroscience surprisingly reveals connections between our conceptions of God and our body and mind.\n\n**Please RSVP to access log-in link.

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now?

Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight. Session 4 – Return with the Elixir: Integration & Wholeness Theme: Carrying creative insight back into everyday life.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

The hands-on, collaborative class will last 2.5 hours, with time to enjoy your meal together at the end.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned cook or just starting out, this class will offer a fun, engaging learning environment, while raising funds for Sonoma Family Meal’s free culinary job training and food-security programs.\n\nIf you haven’t been to the SFM Kitchen yet, this class is also the perfect chance to visit and experience where the magic takes place and how the work gets done.\n\nWHEN: Thursday February 19th, 5-7:30pm WHERE: SFM community kitchen, 1370A Redwood Way, Petaluma\n\nTHE MENU: TBD\n\nABOUT THE CHEF:\n\nChef Carlos was born in El Salvador, where his passion for cooking began in the kitchen with his grandmother and mother, creating simple yet flavorful family meals. After his family migrated to the United States, Carlos worked at his uncle’s restaurant in Sebastopol, further deepening his love for food. While attending Piner High School, in Santa Rosa, he joined a newly established culinary program, where he learned professional kitchen skills and participated in local food competitions with renowned chefs like Guy Fieri and Rich Nolan. In 2008, his high school team won first place in the Santa Rosa Iron Chef competition. During this time, Carlos also took on the responsibility of cooking family meals, solidifying his dream of becoming a chef. \n\nAfter graduating, Carlos started at Jackson’s in Santa Rosa as a dishwasher but quickly worked his way up through various kitchen roles, impressing his colleagues with his dedication and skill. His hard work caught the attention of two restaurateurs, who offered him a sous chef position at their new restaurant. While thriving in this role, Carlos realized his passion for showcasing Latin cuisine and decided to pursue further education. He earned an associate degree from Santa Rosa Junior College’s culinary program and took additional courses at the Culinary Institute of America \\(CIA\\) Greystone, St. Helena focusing on pastry and butchery. Next up, Chef Carlos was the head of food development at La Tortilla Factory in Santa Rosa, creating new recipes and products. \n\nAt 24, Carlos saved $60,000 from playing in a popular, award winning family band and flipping a house with his father. In 2014, he found a small restaurant space in Healdsburg and, with his father as a partner, opened Guiso Latin Fusion on October 15, 2015. Drawing inspiration from Central and South America, Carlos built the restaurant’s reputation organically, eventually gaining recognition from a San Francisco Chronicle food writer, which propelled his success.\n\nFor Carlos, food is art, and every dish tells a story rooted in his culture and childhood. He strives to create a family-like atmosphere in his restaurant, where guests feel connected and leave with memorable experiences. Beyond running his restaurant, Carlos mentors young chefs, develops a rosé wine brand called BELI’S, and continues to “Live a Flavorful Life.” His motto, “Cook My Culture,” reflects his deep connection to his roots and his passion for creating meaningful culinary experiences.\n\nAWARDS\n\n\\+Best Chef, 2025 Healdsburg, CA Healdsburg Tribune \\+The 100 Best Restaurants in America by OpenTable 2025 \\+Multiple Diners choice Awards in 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 \\+Top 100 places to eat in U.S 2024 by Yelp\n\nReserve my spot",

Led by Collin Hoctor, this group brings community, shares wisdom, and brings healing to those who desire to walk a deeper, more meaningful life.\n\nFrom Collin:\n\nI am a psychotherapist and guide whose work weaves together spirituality, nature-based practices, psychedelic therapy, and recovery. My path has been shaped by a foundation in existential philosophy and psychology, medicine circles, and a lifelong study of contemplative and esoteric traditions. Out of my own longing for community and a commitment to the needs of the moment, I am passionate about creating spaces for men to gather in honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity — places where we can face our struggles, share our truths, and remember the healing power of connection.",

Each book will match a BINGO square. Hurrah! Play along with Napa Bookmine and read some new, fun books, and if you come to every meeting, you may get a BINGO in the meantime. ;\\) This month, we'll be talking about Danzy Senna's Colored Television. This is a free event, but we would appreciate your RSVP so we can plan for your attendance! Questions? Email us at events@napabookmine.com ABOUT THE BOOK A NATIONAL BESTSELLER | A GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK | A WASHINGTON POST TOP 10 BOOK OF THE YEAR | A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2024 “A laugh-out-loud cultural comedy… This is the New Great American Novel, and Danzy Senna has set the standard.” –LA Times “Funny, foxy and fleet…The jokes are good, the punches land, the dialogue is tart.” – Dwight Garner, The New York Times A brilliant take on love and ambition, failure and reinvention, and the racial-identity-industrial complex from the bestselling author of Caucasia. Jane has high hopes that her life is about to turn around. After a long, precarious stretch bouncing among sketchy rentals and sublets, she and her family are living in luxury for a year, house-sitting in the hills above Los Angeles. The gig magically coincides with Jane’s sabbatical, giving her the time and space she needs to finish her second novel—a centuries-spanning epic her artist husband, Lenny, dubs her “mulatto War and Peace.” Finally, some semblance of stability and success seems to be within her grasp. But things don’t work out quite as hoped. Desperate for a plan B, like countless writers before her Jane turns her gaze to Hollywood. When she finagles a meeting with Hampton Ford, a hot producer with a major development deal at a streaming network, he seems excited to work with a “real writer,” and together they begin to develop “the Jackie Robinson of biracial comedies.” Things finally seem to be going right for Jane—until they go terribly wrong. Funny, piercing, and page turning, Colored Television is Senna’s most on-the-pulse, ambitious, and rewarding novel yet. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Danzy Senna is the author of four previous works of fiction, including the bestselling Caucasia and, most recently, New People, as well as a memoir. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, she teaches writing at the University of Southern California.",

    "description": "Profs and Pints Napa presents: “The \\(New\\) Science of Attraction,” on psychological research that’s upending assumptions about how we pick partners, with Paul W. Eastwick, professor of psychology at the University of California Davis and author of Bonded by Evolution: The New Science of Love and Connection.\n\nOver the past few decades, a buzzy new branch of science, evolutionary psychology, has spread a deeply flawed story about romantic relationships. Cloaking itself in the language of incontrovertible Darwinian fact, it has popularized the idea that our minds have been shaped by primal drives that pit the genders against each other. It has promoted the myth that men are wired to be promiscuous and the notions that wealth, status, and beauty are the ultimate aphrodisiacs.\n\nIt’s time to say goodbye to such thinking and embrace a more-evolved view of romance, argues Paul W. Eastwick, who co-hosts the Love Factually podcast and operates a UC-Davis research lab that studies attraction and relationships.\n\nCome to Napa Yards for a talk by Dr. Eastwick that will give you a much more sophisticated understanding of matters of the heart. \n\nDrawing from pathbreaking research—including original experiments from his own lab—he’ll offer the take that relationship success hinges on compatibility rather than finding someone who meets some universal ideal of a good partner.\n\nHe’ll show that while popularity factors into first impressions, its influence fades fast. When evaluating mutual friends and acquaintances they’ve known for months, single people barely agree in their ratings of who is or isn’t desirable as a dating partner.\n\nAlthough men and women occasionally say they want different things out of romance, gender differences evaporate once we assess what men and women actually want. Attraction from ancestral times through the present is best depicted as a process of finding—and, often, creating—a compatible relationship.\n\nDr. Eastwick will show how the traits we often look for in a partner—personality, lifestyle, values, and humor—are poor predictors of compatibility. Instead, lasting attraction is built through the gradual forging of strong attachment bonds, through mundane moments in which people offer each other a “safe haven” and “secure base.”\n\nDistilling evolutionary biology, anthropology, and psychology into accessible insights, he’ll explain why we so often choose dating strategies that make us miserable and how we can use a more evolved approach. \\(Tickets available only online. Advance tickets: $13.50 plus processing fees. Doors: $17, or $15 with a student ID. Doors open at 5:30 and the talk begins at 6:30.\\)\n\nImage: “Love Match,” by Jan van Beers \\(Wikimedia Commons\\).",

Charming, smart, heart-blistering, and heart-healing.” —Danez Smith, The New York Times Book Review “We all need—we all deserve—this vibrant, love-affirming novel that bounds over any difference that claims to separate us.” —Ron Charles, The Washington Post In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. As these characters’ stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community—heaven and earth—that sustain us.

    "description": "Mama’s Broke is a powerful folk duo that deliver a compelling performance with heart and raw energy. Although highly influenced by their Canadian roots, Lisa and Amy are based out of nowhere and everywhere. \n\nTheir two strong voices blend to create haunting harmonies, while they artfully juggle fiddle, banjo, guitar and mandolin, and incorporate traditional dance and foot percussion into their performance. Their original – and often dark – compositions push the boundaries of tradition and the constraints of genre. Drawing from old-time, Quebecois, blues, punk, Celtic, Balkan and  doom metal, they create a soundscape that is both familiar and new. \n\nSince forming the band in 2014, Mama’s Broke has been gaining momentum fast ; having already completed two European, and several Canadian and U.S. tours. They have performed in a wide range of venues, from circus shows in New Orleans, to pirate ships in Amsterdam, to concert halls in Ireland, to theatres in Brooklyn. In this way, they stay true to the transient nature of folklore, as they travel the world sharing and collecting song.",

With boot stomping orchestration and lyrics that have been immortalized on the tattooed skin of their fans, The Sam Chase & his band, The Untraditional, don’t mess around. \nWILLY TEA TAYLOR: \nThere is no question that Willy Tea Taylor’s life as a singer/songwriter was predetermined – his role realized the moment he wrote his first song. His inspirations drawn from two separate wells; Living the life of a cattleman’s kid and experiencing true visionaries music like Greg Brown, John Hartford, and Guy Clark. The image of Guy Clark and friends sitting around the kitchen table loaded with ashtrays full of butts, half-smoked cigarettes, food, and booze on one Christmas Eve in 1975 burned into Taylors’s soul. Those guys, swapping songs without pretense, lit Willy Tea’s fire. And ever since, its led purpose with passion – finding a hang by curating relationships through musical friendships that get him closer to his own Clark style kitchen table. \nFrom his early days co-fronting The Good Luck Thrift Store Outfit, to singing solo in countless cowboy bars, to pitching countless wiffle ball games, Willy Tea has never lost the vision. Now Willy Tea Taylor has taken his vision of the “hero hang” on the road. and his talented traveling band The Fellership is made up of his fantastically talented buds who play Willy’s songs with a brand of reckless abandon and utter humility that spits in the face of pretense. The way The Fellership plays Will’s songs is the way they demand to be played and, in their short time together, they have been awe-ing every audience lucky enough to see them.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

From his humble beginnings as a street performer, to being featured on the \\#1 rated show in the USA – Dancing With The Stars. Guitarist and creative force behind the event, Benise, comments “I wanted to push the boundaries of Nuevo Flamenco/Spanish guitar while combining the elements of dance and theater. This show is a celebration of all the shows we’ve done over the last 25 years.” \n\nThe Emmy Award-winning composer along with an international cast of musicians and dancers will entertain audiences with a two-hour show that “is an escape from all of their problems,” Benise says. Beyond the new material, Benise says “the live show will incorporate some fan favorites from my street performing days and rock classics like Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.” In addition, Benise adds his signature touch to classics such as “Ave Maria, “Moonlight Sonata,” and Vivaldi’s “Summer” from The Four Seasons.\n\nBenise adds, “This is a great show for the whole family; I really think we have something for everyone. I hope people will be inspired by our story, by the music, by the production--and have the passion to follow their own dreams.” \n\nThe Theatrical World Music and Dance spectacle that has been called “The Latin Riverdance” \n\n‘The Prince of Spanish Guitar’  - Dancing With The Stars\n\n‘Bennissimo!’ - Chicago News\n\n‘Extreme Flamenco Fusion’ - Screen India",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Almaas)\n\nExperience an exploration of the spiritual journey as a path of love, where the heart’s discontent becomes the doorway to ultimate fulfillment.\n\nAlthough the heart seeks fulfillment in people, possessions, and experiences, no external love can truly satisfy our deepest longing. Our discontent is an opportunity—a sacred invitation to turn inward. True fulfillment arises only when we empty our hearts to make space for the formless and intangible inner Beloved that is our true nature.\n\nJoin A. H. Almaas, founder of the Ridhwan School and the Diamond Approach, on a transformative journey of the heart. Discover how the search for love leads us through emptiness into a luminous darkness—a place where the mind is confounded, but the heart awakens to a passionate love for the unknown and to its potential for resting into the deepest fulfillment possible.\n\nThis half-day program is based on the new book, *The Inner Beloved: The Heart’s Journey to Divine Unity (Shambhala, 2026)*. Copies of the book will be available for purchase at the bookstore, and onsite participants may have their copy of the book signed.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

When we are writing from “reality,” how do we guide readers’ emotions in the direction of the story? In this presentation, we’ll examine work by accomplished authors and our own writing for ways to paint vividly with words, enliven narrative, and awaken readers’ awareness through sensory details within a realm of sensory information that says “these characters, this place, this time, this story.”\n\nAbout the Presenter:Christine Walker is a visual artist and author of the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird” \\(Sibylline Press\\) and the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life” \\(Warner Books\\), and co-author and illustrator of the children’s book “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater.” She has an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary. She is also a consultant in strategic visioning and a writing teacher. She teaches in community venues and online through Sibyl Writing Craft. She lives in Sonoma County.",

Naturalization records can provide valuable information such as a person’s date of  birth and location, occupation, immigration year, marital status, spouse information, witnesses' names and addresses. Naturalization and the individual steps to citizenship could be done at any “court of record” in the United States.\n\n Christine is the Program Director of the Whittier Area Genealogical Society. She is also a member of the Tualatin Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames and the Association of Professional Genealogists.  Her interest in genealogy began in 1977 with the airing of the TV mini-series “Roots”. Her enthusiasm was piqued when she was given a typed pedigree chart, commissioned by her maternal grandfather, of their Dutch heritage from the New Netherlands in the 1650’s.\n\nFREE\n\n Via ZOOM\n\n Register at https://www.scgsonline.org\n\n Registration closes Friday, February 20th",

Come brave the perilous waters of Point Reyes and join us for a rollicking good time at Point Reyes National Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Please bring your arsenal of sea chanteys, any musical instruments you'd like, and a willingness to laugh a lot!  It's so much fun when audience members lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus, and leading a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea chantey radio station and hear what's out there! Practice lyrics! Teach the chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal, mellow, and supportive, so if you've been wanting to push your comfort edge and lead a song, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather just singalong with the chantey choruses, that's fine too. We always have a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of all levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys, there may be lyrics that are not appropriate for children. Reservations not required.

    "description": "Experience wine in the making at Dry Creek Vineyard, a family-owned winery with more than 50 years of history in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek Valley. This immersive Barrel Tasting invites guests beyond the tasting room and into the heart of the winemaking process — sampling wines straight from the barrel before they’re released to the public.\n\nHosted by the winery’s winemakers and longtime family grower partners, guests will hear directly from the people who farm the land, craft the wines and shape each vintage from vine to barrel.\n\nAdding to the excitement, a skilled cooper will be on hand with a live barrel-making demonstration, showcasing the time-honored craft behind the oak barrels that influence flavor, texture and aging. It’s a dynamic, behind-the-scenes experience that blends wine, storytelling and hands-on artistry.\n\nPerfect for curious wine lovers and anyone looking for a memorable wine country experience.",

Dos años después, en el año 2000, fundó el grupo “Tierra Cali”. \n\nHumberto ha sido conocido por revitalizar la música grupera, fusionando elementos del estilo norteño, banda, ritmos tropicales, entre otros, para crear un sonido único que representa la cultura mexicana. En 2008 consolidó su éxito al colocar tres de sus álbumes en el Top 100 de ventas, según Soundscan y Billboard, logrando múltiples premios, incluyendo Discos de Platino y el reconocimiento como Mejor Grupo de Tierra Caliente. \n\nEn esta nueva etapa Humberto Plancarte, busca brindar a sus fanáticos una nueva propuesta musical, mezclando las raíces del regional mexicano con arreglos musicales orquestados, baladas, cumbias y el icónico sabor de Tierra Caliente, apostando por sus letras honestas y románticas que veneran el amor. \n\nHumberto Plancarte, originally from Rancho Las Juntas de Poturo in the municipality of Churumuco, Michoacán, began his musical career in 1998 with the goal of leaving a lasting legacy with his audience.

It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Revision takes time, skill, caring, and fortitude. It asks that we be generous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not for the faint of heart, but for writers committed to their relationship with creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows writers to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll share a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling,” which incorporates my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction, memoir, and nonfiction. The session includes a craft presentation, group discussion, and writing time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful revision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revision• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind• Fiction or nonfiction free write, early draft, or manuscript in progress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and revision challenges to discuss, particularly as relate to the session focusThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each time. Check the schedule, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist, author, and strategic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Dancing at the Bluebird,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating the Creative Life,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Musical Theater,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolution: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and, for publication in 2027, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Literature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Interdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired her to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling, Nine Ways to Mastery, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their writing practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career, she’s found that resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resilience to teaching revision as a writing skill, as well as a practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

These menus often feature multiple courses and highlight seasonal ingredients or signature dishes.

The Buddha taught that everything needed for liberating the heart is already here, within this body. The path is not about becoming different, but remembering all that has been obscured by the habits of conditioning and forgetfulness.\n\nBy returning to the body as a living archive that has never stopped guiding us, we reconnect with the sacred inheritance of wholeness—a continuity passed down through the Buddhadharma and the unbroken line of ancestors whose memories flow within us. This daylong will include silent sitting meditation, Dharma reflections, breath awareness, and gentle interpersonal connections. During our time together we will reconnect with what is already ours, a sense of belonging, spacious presence, and the dignity of simply being alive. Open to both new and experienced practitioners.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artists, **Linda Barretta, Nancy Gray, Bev Haley, Phyllis Rapp, Donna Schaffer, Tosya Shore, Luba Stolper and Gen Zorich** present the **Color of Love,** paintings that bring out the excitement and fun of the Valentine season.  Red takes a starring role in these works set against a broad spectrum of complementary violets, blues, and greens.  In Gray’s “Love Abstractly” an iconic heart is transformed through bold splashes of color.  Stolper brings us delicious red delights in her “Bowl of Strawberries,”  fruit rendered so realistically, one’s mouth waters.  Paintings by Haley, Schaffer and Zorich celebrate the coming of Spring with color-rich floral displays – tulips and scarlet buglers.  Rapp and Barretta offer a nod to our feathered and furry friends. Barretta’s jaunty raven cocks his head as he offers up a heart on a red ribbon in “Raven Heart” and Rapp’s little fox peers at us from a bed of flowers in “Foxy Flowers.”  Shore’s “Showering You with Gifts” catches our eye with a sleek figure sporting a stunning red umbrella.  “As we welcome the sunnier days and flowers in the fields, Valentine’s Day with its rich color palette is such a glorious way to celebrate the seasonal transition,” noted Gray.   \n\nThe Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Laura Roney’s Dance!,** a collection of works that explores dance in its many forms. Part of cultures throughout the world, dance expression takes on styles that can be structured, such as ballet, or, by contrast, free flowing.  And dance is a beloved part of the dating scene, whether slow-dancing or rocking out.  In “Hold Me Tight” one feels the close connection of the couple dancing on Valentine’s Day.  Another couple joyfully whoops it up in “Bust a Move.” Bring on the music – these works make one want to get a move on.\n\nMeet the artist: Roney will be hosting the Gallery on February 1 and 27 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements.

Our audience will be swept away by musical interludes on various stringed instruments from award-winning composer and musician, Jared Emerson-Johnson. Local watercolor artist and college instructor, Barbara Marlin, creator of the Daphne Lifts Up book cover will display the original artwork and selected prints of other work at the event. Following the readings and music, a Q&A will follow, with book sales and signing in the lobby. Refreshments will be available for sale. This is free event, all donations always gratefully accepted.    Donna Emerson divides her time between Petaluma, California, and her family homestead near Ithaca, New York. Retired from teaching at Santa Rosa Jr. College and her clinical social work practice, her recent poetry publications include La Pressa, The Paterson Literary Review, and Weber: The Contemporary West. Her chapbooks: This Water, 2007, Body Rhymes, 2009, Wild Mercy, 2011, and Following Hay, 2013. Her poetry books are The Place of Our Meeting \\(Finishing Line Press, 2018\\) and Beside the Well \\(Cherry Grove Collections. 2019\\). And now, Daphne Lifts Up \\(Finishing Line Press, 2025\\). Donna has received two nominations for the Pushcart Prize, one for \"Best of the Net,\" two nominations for the California Book Award \\(Body Rhymes, 2009, The Place of Our Meeting, 2018\\), five awards from the annual Allen Ginsberg Contests, and numerous regional awards for her poetry, creative non-fiction, and prose. Many of her poems appear in journals or anthologies with her black and white or color photography. Anais Nin used Donna's portraits of Anais in her late diaries and press coverage in the New York Times.  Donna has taught poetry to elementary school children and made it part of her community college classrooms \\(1990-2015\\). She worked as a volunteer with Alzheimer's patients at a residential facility to help them create individual and group poems and served as Board member and Events Chair for the Marin Poetry Center \\(2012-2014\\). Donna's latest book, \"Daphne Lifts Up\" includes poems about nature around us, nature within us, and relationships with many different people, from family to counseling clients, to students, colleagues at work, animals, birds, and strangers. It addresses birth, illness, death, and resiliency in all these verses.    Gerald Fleming is the author of the poetry collections The Bastard and the Bishop \\(Hanging Loose Press, 2021\\), One \\(Hanging Loose, 2016\\), The Choreographer \\(Sixteen Rivers Press, 2013\\), Night of Pure Breathing \\(Hanging Loose, 2011\\), and Swimmer Climbing onto Shore \\(Sixteen Rivers, 2005\\). His work has appeared in many magazines over the decades, including New Letters, Michigan Quarterly Review, Hanging Loose, Carolina Quarterly, New World Writing, Volt, Paris Lit Up, and Versal.  Fleming edited the print magazines Barnabe Mountain Review and Forward to Velma, the vitreous magazine One \\(More\\) Glass, and The Collected Poetry & Prose of Lawrence Fixel \\(Sixteen Rivers, 2021\\). He has written numerous books for teachers, including Rain, Steam, and Speed \\(Jossey-Bass/Wiley, 2005\\), and lives most of the year near San Francisco, part of the year in Paris. Fleming, a master of the prose poem, is never satisfied to sing the same song, and this adventuresome spirit pays dividends in these new prose poems. Constantly surprising and inventive,  The Bastard and the Bishop offers stories within stories that effortlessly merge the personal and the archetypal, breathing new life into a genre that has increasingly, and often sadly, become predictable.     Jared Emerson-Johnson is a video game music composer, sound designer, voice director and voice actor.

The current West County Museum in downtown Sebastopol was the terminal.  Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14,000 railroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set of artifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transportation, manufacturing, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad industry since 1956, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pacific Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum, Fred often ran P&SR passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junction, the only remaining operating car from that railroad.\n\nThis talk is a project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society.

    "description": "Emmy Award Winning Spanish Guitar and Dance Spectacular.\n\nIt’s one hot night as Benise celebrates 25 years of fiery Spanish guitar and dance. \n\nBenise \\(pronounced Buh-nes-say\\) shattered the mold of Spanish guitar by combining world music and dance – the only show of its kind! \n\n2025 marks the year that Benise, “The Prince of Spanish Guitar,” launches his 25th Anniversary Tour and 8th PBS Special “25 Years of Passion!” \n\n Armed with his Spanish guitar and a stage full of musicians and elaborately choreographed dancers, Benise takes the audience on a musical journey through Spanish Flamenco, Cuban Salsa, Brazilian Samba, Parisian Waltz, exotic drumming, and more! \n\nThe 25th Anniversary tour establishes Benise’s Emmy Award winning show as one of the longest running Latin-themed theatrical productions touring the world.\n\nFor Benise, music has always been a journey. From his humble beginnings as a street performer, to being featured on the \\#1 rated show in the USA – Dancing With The Stars. Guitarist and creative force behind the event, Benise, comments “I wanted to push the boundaries of Nuevo Flamenco/Spanish guitar while combining the elements of dance and theater. This show is a celebration of all the shows we’ve done over the last 25 years.” \n\nThe Emmy Award-winning composer along with an international cast of musicians and dancers will entertain audiences with a two-hour show that “is an escape from all of their problems,” Benise says. Beyond the new material, Benise says “the live show will incorporate some fan favorites from my street performing days and rock classics like Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.” In addition, Benise adds his signature touch to classics such as “Ave Maria, “Moonlight Sonata,” and Vivaldi’s “Summer” from The Four Seasons.\n\nBenise adds, “This is a great show for the whole family; I really think we have something for everyone. I hope people will be inspired by our story, by the music, by the production--and have the passion to follow their own dreams.” \n\nThe Theatrical World Music and Dance spectacle that has been called “The Latin Riverdance” \n\n‘The Prince of Spanish Guitar’  - Dancing With The Stars\n\n‘Bennissimo!’ - Chicago News\n\n‘Extreme Flamenco Fusion’ - Screen India",

    "description": "Bone by Bone: The Commingled Remains from theTomb at Tell Abraq, UAE (2200-2000 BC)  The tomb at the archaeological site of Tell Abraq, located near modern-day Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was discovered in 1989 and excavated over several field seasons. Over 300 individuals were placed in the tomb including premature and newborn infants, toddlers, teens, and adult males and females of all ages. Over time,the addition of corpses caused the disarticulation of most all of the skeletal remains. Our analysis proceeded on a bone by bone basis and questions about health and disease, trauma and violence, and diet and nutrition were addressed using innovative methods for skeletal analysis. \"Osteobiographies\" were created that provide a glimpse into what life was like over 4000 years ago in in the deserts of Arabia. And, one very enigmatic teenager, the only individual whose remains were not commingled, and perhaps the last person to be put in the tomb, provides a poignant reminder of the toll that disease takes.Event Details    Sunday, February 22nd from 4-5 pm    SRJC Petaluma Student Center in Mike Smith Hall    Debra L. Martin, Distinguished Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, is an expert on violence in past societies, which includes expertise in human osteology and bioarchaeology. She received her PhD from the University of Massachusetts. The analysis of skeletonized human remains from archaeological as well as historic and contemporary settings form a basis for understanding the effects of trauma, fractures, disability and wounds related to lethal and nonlethal violence. She is the Series Editor for Bioarchaeology and Social Theory, a book series dedicated to cutting-edge bioarchaeological work published by Springer Verlag. She is also the Editor of the journal, American Antiquity. Her recent publications include co-authoring Gender Violence in the American Southwest (AD 1100) (Routledge), co-editing Bioarchaeology of Borders and Frontiers (UPF), Massacres (UPF), and Bioarchaeological and Forensic Perspectives on Violence (Cambridge). She is co-author of the textbook, Bioarchaeology An Integrated Approach to Working with Human Remains.",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

He studied black-and-white photography in college and had plans to be a photojournalist until life intervened. After spending an adulthood in law enforcement, Phil picked up his camera again and began making art.  Phil’s preference is nature/landscape, but he is drawn to shapes, lines, and shadows found in urban landscapes. “My favorite subjects are old rusted cars, trains, abandoned buildings, and brightly colored doors.  I use several plugins in Photoshop to create surreal images from otherwise ordinary photos.  I create photos in both color and black and white, depending on subject matter and mood.”\n\nPhil is President of the Napa Valley Photographic Society, and a member of the Fairfield Suisun Valley Art Association, the Vacaville Art League, Gold Rush Photo Club, and the Lightwriters Photography Club.  Phil is also a member of the Professional Photographers of America, and the Photographic Society of America.\n\nPhil’s work has been shown at Viewpoint Gallery, Sacramento; Yountville Community Center, The Old Sugar Mill, Arata Fine Arts Gallery, and the Roseville Brewing Company, including shows at the Vacaville Art Gallery, the Napa Public Library, Solano Town Center Gallery, the Gallery at Village 360, and he is a resident artist at The Little Shop in Benicia.  He has won several awards at local shows and contests, including a Juror's Choice Award at the 2013 Vacaville Art Gallery Juried Art Show.  Phil’s photos can be seen at www.philipvenablephotography.com.  He is also on Facebook as Philip Venable Photography.  Contact Phil at philven@comcast.net.\n\nNapa Valley Photographic Society \\(NVPS\\) promotes the art and science of photography, providing education, image appreciation, inspiration, exchange of technologies.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Each player performed a twenty-to-thirty minute set, and everyone jammed together with Hummel’s Blues Survivors as backup. Over the next five years, it grew to become a multi venue event around California and included bigger names like William Clarke, Norton Buffalo, and Paul DeLay. By the year 2000 the Blowout was headlining Yoshi’s in Oakland as a four-night show with Rod Piazza, Kim Wilson, Rick Estrin, James Harman and Billy Branch. These shows were recorded for Mountain Top Records.  \n\nSince then, the Blues Harmonica Blowout has become a who’s who of older and younger players, black, white, male and female, national, and international. From icons like Snooky Pryor, Carey Bell, James Cotton, Charlie Musselwhite, John Mayall, John Hammond, Little Sonny, Lazy Lester, Billy Boy Arnold, Sam Myers, Corky Siegel, Magic Dick, Huey Lewis, Lee Oscar, Jerry Portnoy, Howard Levy and Paul Oscher to younger players like Sugar Ray Norcia, Jason Ricci, Son Of Dave, Aki Kumar, Curtis Salgado, Kenny Neal, RJ Mischo, Sugar Blue, Annie Raines, Carlos Del Junco, just to name a few. \n\nThe selection of guitarists has also been a stunner including Duke Robillard, Rusty Zinn, Bob Welsh, Little Charlie Baty, Anson Funderburgh, Jr. Watson, Billy Flynn, Steve Freund, Mike Keller, and many more.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Abstract art has the power to evoke emotions, appeal to our senses and transcend the physical world. Abstract expression captures the delicate, elusive, powerful and radiant energies that fly under the radar of explanation.\n\nWe are excited to have you share with us your visions in the abstract and look forward to putting together a dynamic exhibition of work that reflects the power and importance of abstract art.\n\nAccepting the following mediums: painting, printmaking, photographs, sculpture, glass, wood, ceramics, fiber and paper.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

If you would like to set up a meeting to discuss your estate planning needs further, we offer all participants who complete the webinar a free, no obligation personal consultation with one of the attorneys.\n\nAt this webinar, we will discuss several common issues and concerns, including:\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of wills, living trusts, and probate\n\nProtecting your children’s inheritance from their future ex-spouses, lawsuits, and other claims\n\nMost living trusts fail; if you already have a trust, find out what you can do to ensure that it will protect you and your loved ones\n\nHow to preserve your nest egg for your family if you find yourself needing Long Term Care\n\nHow to stay out of court and avoid the cost, time, and stress that a conservatorship can bring if you become incapacitated.\n\nAttend a webinar and receive a FREE no-obligation consultation with an Attorney to answer any questions about setting up your estate plan \\($425 value\\).",

No experience needed-just curiosity!\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBased on the Tamalpa Life/Art Process, founded by Anna Halprin, this four-week class invites participants to explore the connection between body, mind, and imagination through gentle movement, art-making, and writing. Each session blends simple, creative activities designed to transform life experiences into art and open new possibilities for personal renewal. In a supportive and beginner-friendly environment, students will deepen self-awareness, express emotions, and discover fresh perspectives. No prior dance or art experience is required—just curiosity and an open heart. Course Format and Weekly Outline: Session 1 – The Call & Crossing the Threshold: Mapping the Self Theme: Where am I now? Practices: Guided movement warm-up; sensory awareness; movement exploration of stepping toward/away from a “threshold”; body mapping with paint/collage; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants identify their current state and set creative intentions for the series. Session 2 – Trials & Allies: Shadows and Strengths Theme: Meeting obstacles and discovering resources. Practices: Movement exploration of “allies and shadows”; expressive drawing/painting; optional mask or small clay object; reflective writing; small-group witnessing. Outcome: Students recognize inner strengths and gain flexible tools for navigating emotions and challenges. Session 3 – Ordeal & Transformation: Release and the Boon Theme: Releasing old patterns and discovering new insights. Practices: Grounding movement; movement ritual exploring “what I am ready to release”; creation of the “Boon” object or image; reflective writing. Outcome: Participants experience personal renewal and create a symbolic object representing newly gained insight. Session 4 – Return with the Elixir: Integration & Wholeness Theme: Carrying creative insight back into everyday life. Practices: Movement exploration of “pathways of return”; creation of a triptych \\(Before / Crossing / Return\\); gallery walk and group witnessing; closing ritual with shared intentions. Outcome: Students integrate learning and leave with practical creative practices for ongoing self- discovery and stress relief. Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop greater self-awareness by exploring personal experiences through movement, art-making, and reflective writing. 2. Use creative tools for well-being, including techniques for emotional expression, personal renewal, and stress reduction. 3. Strengthen confidence and connection through supportive group activities and experiments with expressive movement and visual art.",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

    "description": "Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th-March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (first 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggie)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

This spring in-person writing retreat led by Marilyn MacEntyre follows her successful online workshops and in-person retreats in 2023-25.\n\nWe are delighted to invite you to her 2026 spring offering, this retreat will run February 26-28 2026, 4:00 pm Thursday through 3:00 pm Saturday.\n\nEscalating political conflict, a polarized economy, ongoing warfare, and climate anxieties give us plenty of occasion to come face to face with our fears. We may have to dig deeper for hope these days, but we know where to find it. In our hours together we'll be reflecting on how \"Be not afraid\" comes to us not simply as an admonition but as an invitation, and how even in the midst of troubles, both public and personal, we can help each other find our way back to the heart of God in whom we can find both our own peace and the courage to be peacemakers.\n\nWriting exercises will focus on experiences of fear, courage, consolation, and resilience in the historical moment we share and in our own sometimes shadowy paths.\n\nMarilyn McEntyre, writer and longtime professor of literature, coaches writers and teaches in programs at New College Berkeley, Western Theological Seminary and the Oblate School of Theology. Her books include Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies, When Poets Pray, and Speaking Peace in a Climate of Conflict. A new book about writing, Start With a Word, is coming out in February 2026 and can be pre-ordered at eerdmans.com. See more, and contact her, at marilynmcentyre.com.\n\nCost: $295-$695 depending on choices about lodging/commuting\n\nPartial scholarships available \n\nRegister at https://www.stcolumbasinverness.org/be-not-afraid",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

In this presentation, Firuze shares her creative process of transforming whale songs, spectrograms, and real marine research into vibrant visual art. Through the true stories of individual whales and the scientific discoveries behind her pieces, she explores how storytelling can spark emotional connection and drive conservation action. This talk invites audiences to listen more deeply to the ocean, understand the lives of the whales who inhabit it, and discover the power of art as a voice for the natural world.\n\nFiruze Gokce reached a significant milestone with the debut of her first solo art exhibition on May 23rd, showcasing her \"Whale Sounds on a Canvas\" collection. This exhibition featured her prints and immersive videos that blended visual art with the auditory experience of whale songs, offering a multi-sensory exploration of marine life. Firuze’s innovative approach incorporates actual whale sound recordings into her artwork. Additionally, her piece \"Brave Little Hunter\" was requested by Bay Cetology on Vancouver Island, highlighting her ability to convey the emotional depth of the natural world. Firuze was also accepted into the prestigious Sonoma County Art Trails Program in October 2024, further solidifying her place in the art community. Her artwork “Diving into the Depths of the Ocean” received an “Honorary Mention Award” from the Marine Society of Artists.\n\nGuests are welcome to arrive early and enjoy Firuze Gokce’s art exhibit, Whale Sounds on a Canvas II, currently on view at the Laguna Environmental Center from January 10 – April 24, 2026.",

    "description": "An event to raise funds for refurbishing the parish-hall kitchen at St. Paul's Episcopal Church takes place on Thursday, Feb. 26, in Healdsburg. \"Sip, Savor, Serve\" begins at 6 p.m. at the Paul Mahder Gallery, 222 Healdsburg Ave., and will feature wine, hors d'oeuvres and a silent auction with many tantalizing prizes, among them trips to lovely resorts, tickets to a San Francisco Giants baseball game with an overnight stay in that city, restaurant gift certificates, merchandise from high-end women's clothing stores, hair salon gift certificates, wine experiences and much more.\n\nSt. Paul's is a leader in serving Healdsburg residents who need food, personal care items, a place to take a hot shower, or assistance with transportation and clothing. The church's Shower Ministry is open three days per week and in 2025 provided 1,164 showers. Every Tuesday the church serves a hot soup-and-bread luncheon. Food is available the other two days the Shower Ministry is open each week. And the parish hall at 209 Matheson St. is the site of Healdsburg's weekly Sunday dinner.

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Be it a book, blog, script, essay, dissertation, resume, melody, poem or just plain work stuff, you are invited to write it with us. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice. Instead of just thinking about writing, come and get some real writing done.\n\nJOIN US!\n\n1. RSVP - space is limited to 12 people. (registration closes at one half hour before the event starts). You will receive the link to access the event at that time. REMEMBER TO CHECK YOUR EMAIL FOR PASSCODE!\n2. Before or at 3pm join the meeting with the link you receive AND ADD PASSCODE.\n\nPlease note:\n\n1. If you don't have Zoom set up on your computer yet, leave 15-30 minutes ahead of time to get it set up!\n2. If you have difficulty with audio (don't have a microphone set up), as long as you have a speaker, you can call in (you'll see phone numbers when you log in).\n3. If you are late, you won't be able to intro with us, but you are still welcome to join in.\n4. If you won't be able to make it, please cancel so that the space is available to another writer.\n\nSCHEDULE:\n3:00 - quick intros.\naround 3:10 - timer starts: write for 70 mins.\n4:20 - (the end) wrap up\n\nWherever you are, we hope to see you online! Keep on writing...\nRegards,\nLorraine Segal",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

We’re kicking off a brand-new series of stand-up comedy nights with one of the best standup comedians in town (in our opinion, in other people’s opinions, and soon, in your opinion too): Steve Ausburne!\n\nMaybe you laughed your face off at our last comedy night in November - or maybe you didn’t… because you weren’t there. Either way, Steve is back. He’s our main man, living-room ringmaster, and the producer behind the show. Steve’s comedy career got its start as an MC for friends’ bands, which eventually led to his first stand-up set - a set so memorable it earned him a lifetime ban from a church in Grants Pass, Oregon. But Steve didn’t let that slow him down. Instead, he embraced the stage as a place for brutally honest, painfully awkward life confessions - the kind usually reserved for therapy, or very, very funny comedy.\n\nAnd he’s not coming alone.\n\nJalisa Robinson joins the lineup - a proud Midwesterner now living in California, and a 2022 Semi-Finalist in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. She’s a favorite at The Punchline San Francisco, Cobb’s, San Jose Improv, Rooster T. Feathers, and Don’t Tell Comedy, and performs regularly at clubs and festivals across California and beyond. If sharp, witty, and hilarious is your vibe, Jalisa’s got you covered.\n\nAnd then there’s Ronn Vigh - our headliner. Ronn has written for *Fashion Police* on E! Television and performs stand-up at clubs, colleges, and venues across the country. He still dreams of becoming a weatherman (we support the dream). In the meantime, he’s an avid yogi (when not hungover), a devoted *Golden Girls* fan, and - despite being gay - a lifelong football lover.",

    "description": "Bluegrass, old time and acoustic roots music with outstanding musicianship Like the powerful mandolinist and composer at its helm, John Reischman and the Jaybirds fashion a stylish take on bluegrass that seamlessly blends original songs and instrumentals with Appalachian old-time music for a truly unique band sound. Now in their 20th year, with seven acclaimed albums and two Juno nominations, the Jaybirds are simultaneously innovative and unadorned, sophisticated and stripped-down, happily old-fashioned and 21st-century contemporary.  Tickets are $35 advance, $40 at the door. Discount for OCA members. Doors open at 6:30 PM. OCA is wheelchair accessible. Art gallery open during intermission, refreshments for sale.  Get Tickets  Bluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman \"one of the world's undisputed masters\" of the mandolin, famed for outstanding tone and taste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular favourites for sessions and covers, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded on many other projects, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music with highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller; the duo has released three superb albums. John began his career in the San Francisco Bay area in the early '80s with the eclectic Good Ol' Persons bluegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary \"new acoustic\" quartet, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit, renowned for highly skilled instrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early '90s and in 1999 formed the Jaybirds. Of their latest album, Folk Radio UK said \"On That Other Green Shore showcases an accomplished, experienced band at the peak of their powers, with musicianship of the very highest order.\" Peghead Nation called it \"one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017.\" Los Angeles, CA-based guitarist Patrick Sauber joined the Jaybirds in 2017. The veteran performer has played with, among others, Doc Watson, Richard Greene, John Jorgensen, Peter Rowan, Tim O'Brien and John Fogerty. He played on the 2016 Grammy-nominated album The Hazel and Alice Sessions by Laurie Lewis, and appeared in the film A Mighty Wind with Christopher Guest. Bluegrass Unlimited describes Patrick's playing on John's tune Daylighting the Creek as \"a glorious flatpicking solo that hews back to the glory days of early bluegrass guitar.\" Chilliwack, BC-based Trisha Gagnon is portrayed by Sing Out! as \"one of the most versatile\" and \"irresistible\" lead vocalists in bluegrass, her strong and distinctive style ranging from \"mournful and plaintive\" to \"hopeful and yearning.\" Trisha anchors what Dirty Linen magazine calls \"gorgeous three-part harmonies.\" She's also known for songwriting, dating back to her early days with the award-winning B.C. bluegrass band Tumbleweed. Her solo album includes guests Vince Gill and Peter Rowan. Nanaimo, BC-based Nick Hornbuckle has developed his own voice on the five-string banjo - a two-finger roll unlike other contemporary banjo players. \"Nick Hornbuckle's banjo can be downright spine-tingling,\" said the L.A Daily News. His solo album 12×2 \\(\\+/-1\\), was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2015, and Nick is a composer who also digs for rare old-time gems. His sprightly instrumental Wellesley Station on the new Jaybird album \"showcases Nick's sharp picking and sense of melody,\" said Green Man Review. Spokane, WA-based Greg Spatz is hailed as a \"world-class bluegrass fiddler\" by Fiddler Magazine. Audiophile Audition says Greg's \"virtuosic playing is flawlessly delivered time after time,\" while Bluegrass Unlimited says he \"lays down some seriously fine bluegrass fiddle\" on the latest Jaybirds release. His strong chops have made him a popular fixture down through the years on the West Coast, where he's played with iconic mandolinist Frank Wakefield, resophonic guitar master Rob Ickes, and many others including Laurie Lewis, Bryan Bowers, and Eli West and Cahalen Morrison. Greg also plays and records with Mighty Squirrel, has a solo album called Fiddler's Dream and a duo recording with his wife called All Along the Sea, and is an award-winning",

    "description": "with Vinny Ferraro, Frank Ostaseski and Pam Dunn\n\nThis yearlong journey, inspired by Stephen Levine’s *A Year to Live*, is a heartfelt invitation to people of all ages, at any stage of life. Together, in the spirit of community, we will explore how contemplating death can profoundly deepen our experience of living.\n\nIn our modern world, where we often shy away from the reality of our mortality, we rarely pause to consider the preciousness of each moment. The Buddha encouraged us to reflect on death not out of fear, but as a way to awaken to the fleeting beauty of our lives. By embracing this practice, we come to appreciate the fragility and impermanence of our existence.\n\nThis program is a yearlong exploration of forgiveness, gratitude, and letting go. Through guided meditations, thoughtful inquiry, and intimate group discussions, we will support one another in discovering what death has to teach us about life and vice versa.\n\n**Program Includes**\n\n**Format**: Online via Zoom (must know how to join a specific breakout room manually)\n\n**Teachings**: Monthly (12) large group sessions (attendance at 10 of 12 live sessions required; this must include the first session on Jan 31st)\n\n**Home Groups (required!)**: Monthly (12), 1-hour, self-facilitated, self-hosted Home Groups that meet in between large group sessions. They are a foundational aspect of this program and will be organized by Spirit Rock. Each group will determine a time/day and location (online or in-person) that works for everyone during the January large group session.\n\n**Home practice**: Guided meditations, readings, reflections (estimated 5-7 hours/month + monthly Home Groups + daily meditation)\n\n**Access**: Video and audio recording access for 1 year after program ends via our Online Learning Platform\n\n**Q&As**: Monthly, 1-hour, recorded (optional)",

During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

The word collage comes from the French verb coller, meaning \"to glue,\" and is all about merging various materials to tell a visual story. Much like our lives, which are shaped by countless moments and experiences, collage pieces bring together fragments that reveal hidden connections and untold narratives. In this class, you’ll reflect on what matters most to you and how that can be expressed through art. Catherine will help you release the need for perfection and trust your creative instincts. By the end of the workshop, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but also a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for the art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your personal story in your art, Methods for sourcing interesting collage papers, Techniques for crafting textured, multi-layered collages, Strategies for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life, copies of photos, old letters, books, papers from memorable experiences or travels, or documents that hold meaning. If you’re not comfortable using these documents, you should make color copies of them. For this process, it is also best to make laser copies of your photographs.Supplies provided by instructor: some collage papers, acrylic medium, brushesCLICK HERE TO READ DOCUMENT PRIOR TO PURCHASING CLASSAbout the instructor: Catherine Cruz is a French-American artist whose work is informed by the textures and patterns created by the passing of time and the effects of the natural elements on the built environment. She has taught collage and mixed media in the Bay Area and France since 2019. Her background is in interior design and green building certification. She works from her home studio in Sebastopol, CA, and participates in Art Trails Open Studios.

    "description": "with Phillip Moffitt\n\nThe Naturally Arising method starts meditation practice in a different manner. It begins with a preliminary, preparatory practice in which all the attention is systematically and repeatedly oriented inwardly. During this weekend non-residential retreat, Phillip will teach two practices that create the conditions for what he terms an “inward staying mind” to naturally arise.\n\nThe first of these practices is “The Three Renunciations,” which establishes a discerning mind that is free of reactivity and self-judgment. The second practice, the Arriving Sequence, establishes a mind state that is available for practice and aligned with the Dhamma. When combined, the fruition of these practices is a naturally arising responsive mind. In this way, we become free of the efforting that so often plagues our practice.\n\nFrom there, we turn toward the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and we explore different capacities of consciousness that enhance insight. Throughout the meditation practice periods, there is continual emphasis on directly knowing experience through the felt sense. The result is a mind that has great clarity and is available to the natural emergence of wisdom and compassion.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own.

Anchored by a collaborative, life-size sculptural work by Priscila Soares and JeanCherie, the exhibition brings together works by women artists exploring power as something lived, embodied, and deeply personal.\n\nAt the heart of the gallery stands a mountain lioness woman — a guardian figure shaped by two artists working together, each bringing her own voice, materials, and vision. Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared. It is both a celebration of women artists and an invitation to step into presence, creativity, and connection.\n\nOpening Reception:\n\nMarch 1, 12–4pm\n\nGallery Hours:\n\nSundays in March, 12–4pm\n\nLocation:\n\nMare Island Art Studios\n\n110 Pintado St.\n\nVallejo, CA",

    "description": "American power metallers Vicious Rumors may not be superstars, but the group deserve credit for being true to their musical identity and consistently delivering heartfelt, fashion-resistant music that their fans clearly appreciate. Vicious Rumors were formed in 1980 in Santa Rosa, California, by guitarist Geoff Thorpe. Filling out the original lineup were vocalist Mark Tate, guitarist Jim Cassero, bassist Jeff Barnacle, and drummer Walt Perkins. The band first received recognition that same year when they began performing Metal Mondays in Bill Graham's Old Waldorf night club. These shows represented the birth of what would become known as the Bay Area metal scene: the biggest, longest-lasting, most important metal community in the United States. After self-releasing a few singles and being included on several important metal compilations, Vicious Rumors signed their first record contract in 1984 with the surging Shrapnel Records, operated by fellow northern Californian and metal entertainer Mike Varney. By this time, several drummers had been enlisted to fill a spot vacated by Perkins; Larry Howe got the job full-time and would hold if for ten years. Tate was also replaced with vocalist Gary St. Pierre from Hawaii, Chuck Moomy had replaced Cassero on guitar, and bassist Dave Starr replaced Barnacle. Soldiers of the Night The group's full-length debut, Soldiers of the Night, was released in 1986 to an especially warm European response. East Coast shred guitar hero Vinnie Moore was brought in briefly after Moomy's departure, but the virtuoso didn't stay long, as he was anxious to begin his solo instrumental career. Before the door closed behind Moore, St. Pierre was also sent packing, and the classic Digital Dictator Vicious Rumors lineup was formed: vocalist Carl Albert, guitarists Thorpe and Mark McGee, bassist Starr, and drummer Howe. This group would stay together for nine years. The Shrapnel follow-up, Digital Dictator, was released in 1988, and as the band's popularity began to grow domestically, they were signed to Atlantic Records. The group's self-titled debut for the label followed in 1990, and Vicious Rumors supported it with extensive touring. While never close to a top-level U.S. metal act, it appeared at the dawn of the '90s that the band had a real shot at breaking into the spotlight with bands like Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche. That upward trend continued with 1991's Welcome to the Ball and 1992's Plug in and Hang on: Live in Tokyo, which commemorated an extremely successful Japanese tour. Word of Mouth During a layoff due to an injury to Thorpe, the group was released from their contract with Atlantic, perhaps due not only to the band's relative inactivity, but also to the declining stateside popularity of the melodic power metal genre. Many European and Japanese record deals followed, as well as a few member changes while the band trudged on through the '90s. Word of Mouth was released in 1994 and the group remained busy touring the U.S. and Europe. As they were preparing their next release, Something Burning, Carl Albert died on April 22, 1995. The band decided to continue on, releasing an Albert tribute EP and live full-length recording of the singer's final performance. Something Burning was finally released in 1996, and the disc featured Thorpe pulling double duty by filling in on lead vocals. This record solidified Vicious Rumors' European base as many positive reviews and another successful tour followed. Cyber-Christ While Thorpe's vocal work was more than competent, the guitarist couldn't approach Albert's dexterity, and a new vocalist was needed in order for the band to incorporate older songs into their live set. Singer Brian O'Connor joined the group for 1998's Cyber-Christ's recording and tour. O'Connor was replaced in 2000 by Morgan Thorn, who appears on the 2001 release Sadistic Symphony. The band went on a short hiatus after the album's release, eventually coming back together in 2006 and releasing their ninth studio long-player, Warball, which saw them returning to the more traditional, less experimental power metal style of their earlier recordings. The band moved to the popular German hard rock label SPV for their next round of releases: 2011's Razorback Killers, 2013's Electric Punishment, and 2016's Concussion Protocol.",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

If you find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring, you can sign up for the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

    "description": "Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th-March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (first 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggie)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

Bring a copy of your receipt at check-in to Painting/Drawing Studio adjacent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly, heart-centered gathering where we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of compassion, protection, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and echoed across many cultures, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and all who have passed, those in transition, and those in distress.This ongoing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war, with a special focus now on the approximately 19,000 children who have perished in Israel and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple, meditative act of working with clay, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public exhibits and peace sites, offering spaces for reflection, mourning, and hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each month at SebArts, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to ages 12 - adult, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.There is no fee for this class; donations are welcome to help cover materials and expenses. More than a class, this is a shared space of warmth and care—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

    "description": "*What About Age?* art exhibit has arrived in Marin County! Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

This Pop singer/songwriter has toured from coast to coast making waves all over the country. Michelle's 2021 single Come to Me has caught the attention of the press and reached number 1 on Indie Radio! Hailing from the Bay Area Lambert began studying violin at age 2 and has continued making music ever since. A pop folk and hip-hop artist whose career has taken her across the U.S. and abroad she is influenced by her studies in Celtic music. Female empowerment is a recurring theme in her music. You can learn more at michellelambert.com!\n\n-\n\n\"Michelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly knowing bursts. Whether it’s goosing the expectation of a breezy pop-country tune with a confident hip-hop-flavored flow an aching desire slipping out from between the lyrics of a ballad or the way Michelle dominates every inch of the stage before wielding her violin in classic rock goddess mode. Michelle Lambert is a genre-defying 21st century talent with a lot on her mind!\"\n\n-Dennis Willis Soundwaves TV-\n\n-\n\n“Girl On Fire Michelle Lambert makes a melting pot of pop. Michelle Lambert pulls from many talents and influences when she makes her genre-bending music. That juxtaposition from raw emotional singer-songwriter to classical musician is one that Lambert relishes in her genre-crossing pop music.”\n\nCharlie Swanson – Bohemian",

    "description": "FREE BEYOND GOAL SETTING MASTERCLASS with Shawn Langwell\n\nWhy Trying Harder Isn’t Working — and What Actually Does\n\nA 90-Minute interactive workshop for ambitious people who are tired of feeling stressed out and stuck.\n\nFrom the author of Ten Seconds of Boldness and Beyond Recovery\n\nYou’ve done what you were taught to do:\n\nSet goals. Made plans. Pushed harder. Try to stay disciplined.\n\nAnd yet… something still isn’t moving.\n\nThis workshop is for people who are doing “the right things” — in life, work, business, leadership, or creative endeavors — but feel stuck, stalled, or quietly frustrated underneath it all.\n\nNot because you’re lazy. Not because you’re broken. But because there are things no one ever taught you in school.\n\nWHAT THEY DON’T TEACH YOU\n\nThey don’t teach you how to:\n\n• Move forward when confidence hasn’t shown up yet\n\n• Stop overthinking without giving up responsibility\n\n• Take action when clarity is incomplete• Make progress without burning yourself out\n\n• Lead yourself \\(and others\\) through uncertainty with integrity\n\nThis session is grounded in decades of real-world experience — not theory, hype, or hustle culture.\n\nEverything you’ll hear has been lived, tested, failed at, adjusted, and practiced in real careers, real leadership roles, and real life.\n\nWHAT THIS WORKSHOP IS ABOUT\n\nThis is not a goal-setting seminar.\n\nIt’s a practical, human conversation about:\n\n• Why people stay stuck in planning and preparation\n\n• How clarity actually shows up \\(it doesn’t come first\\)\n\n• Why willingness matters more than readiness\n\n• How small, bold and honest steps create real momentum\n\nYou’ll be invited to slow down, get honest, and reconnect with what actually matters right now — without pressure or performance.\n\nYOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:\n\n• Recognize where overthinking is keeping you stuck\n\n• Get clear about what you really want \\(not what you think you should want\\)\n\n• Stop waiting to feel ready before you begin\n\n• Replace pressure with willingness\n\n• Take meaningful action even when confidence isn’t there yet\n\nYOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH:\n\n• Greater clarity about what’s actually holding you back\n\n• Relief from self-imposed pressure• A renewed sense of direction\n\n• One honest, doable next step forward\n\n• A practical way to move without burning out\n\nNo hype. No fixing. No pretending.\n\nJust grounded movement.\n\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR\n\nShawn Langwell is an Inspirational Author, Teacher, and Sales & Executive Gap Mindset Coach/Consultant with more than three decades of sales and leadership experience.\n\nHe is the author of Beyond Recovery, Ten Seconds of Boldness \\(and its companion workbook\\), Morning Motivation, and Chill.\n\nHis work is grounded, practical, and focused on real change — without hype, dogma, or pressure.\n\nLearn more at www.shawnlangwell.com\n\nREADY TO TAKE THE NEXT BOLD STEP FORWARD?\n\nFor those who are ready, this workshop opens the door to deeper live workshops and 1:1 coaching designed to help you take the next bold steps forward — and begin manifesting the goals and changes you’ve been thinking about for far too long.\n\nNo pressure. Just alignment.\n\nThat’s where alignment begins — and overwhelm ends.",

They have been great contributors and carriers of the lineage and yet have too often remained hidden beneath the surface of history. Their stories are fierce, resilient, and revolutionary. Do you know them?\n\nFrom the first Buddhist nuns who challenged the norms of their time, to modern-day teachers, mothers, activists, and visionaries reshaping spiritual life today, women have always been keystones to the continuation of the Dharma. This benefit event invites all genders to step into that legacy—to see, honor, and draw strength from the women who have shaped the Dharma with their courage and uncompromising truth.\n\nTogether with an inspiring group of contemporary Dharma teachers, we’ll explore these stories and ask: What guidance do these spiritual ancestors offer us now—when clarity, groundedness, and collective courage are so urgently needed?",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typically painterly in effect, made by applying or painting ink to an historically, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to acrylic or a gel plate, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing processes, mono-printing creates one final image.  However, it is possible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final image - but it is its own image, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn this class, we will use the idea of experimenting, and using drawing, tracing, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  These found materials create all kinds of markings, shapes and images - as they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the stencils and create openings for more texture, shapes, and imagery to create layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling back the paper for the look, it is the surprise element that keeps me coming back to this process.  This process also works well with other printmaking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut into shapes and images, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images.  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing, they might even be considered poetic.",

It  includes some of her compositions created during the pandemic, with very sentimental lyrics and mourning for the death of her husband Paul Cohen.  Her 14th album is produced by Orlando Aispuro, a guitarist and producer who has collaborated with artists such as Carín León, C.Tangana and Matisse.\n\n \n\nTo commemorate her 25 years of artistic career, the Mexican singer-songwriter offered a special concert at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, which was recorded on a live album called 'Desde Bellas Artes México'\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLila Downs, una de las voces más poderosas y singulares que existen en el mundo, regresa a Europa con la gira mundial ‘Dos Corazones’, en la que estrenará algunas de las canciones de su nuevo disco ‘La Sánchez’, que saldrá en verano, y que incluye algunas de sus composiciones creadas durante la pandemia, con letras muy sentimentales y de duelo por el fallecimiento de su marido Paul Cohen.\n\n \n\nGanadora de un Grammy y 6 Latin Grammy, Lila Downs triunfa sobre el escenario por su personalidad y por las historias conmovedoras que se narran en las letras de sus canciones, en las que denuncia la injusticia social, los problemas de la inmigración y la defensa de las mujeres, especialmente las indígenas y las trabajadoras.\n\n \n\nSu nuevo trabajo ‘La Sánchez’ \\(Sony Music\\), en referencia a su apellido materno, contiene sonidos del norte de su país, hace un homenaje a su influencia materna y narra vicisitudes de las relaciones personales y sociales. Su disco número 14 está producido por Orlando Aispuro, guitarrista y productor que ha colaborado con artistas como Carín León, C.Tangana y Matisse.\n\n \n\nPara conmemorar sus 25 años de trayectoria artística, la cantante y compositora mexicana, ofreció un concierto especial en el Palacio de Bellas Artes en México, que se grabó en un disco en directo que se llama ‘Desde Bellas Artes México’.",

A peace that arises from being fully present, embodied, and grounded.\n\nThrough sitting and walking meditation, and periods of silence, we will explore the body as part of the living earth and awareness as a refuge that is always available. Rather than striving for calm, the practice invites us to rest in what already holds us—moment by moment, breath by breath.\n\nThis is offered as a time to slow down, listen deeply, and reconnect with the unshakeable peace within our own hearts.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

    "description": "Wayne Thiebaud's lushly painted still life's of cakes, pies, and gumball machines are icons of modern American Art. But there is another large body of Thiebaud's art that is relatively unknown: his prints. Thiebaud had a life-long passion for printmaking --- his first print was made of pieces of linoleum he ran through the wringer of his mother's washing machine! And he continued making prints until well into his 90s. This exhibition will highlight Thiebaud's printed artwork spanning 6 decades, exploring common themes and subject matter and the artist's unusual working method. In addition, the exhibition will focus on Thiebaud's extraordinary relationship with his New York gallerist Allan Stone. Stone gave Thiebaud his first major exhibition and continued to represent him for over 45 years, a legendary relationship in the art world. Also join us for a wrap-around program lecture on Thursday, January 29th, 2026 to hear Wayne Thiebaud: The Whole Story from Linda Loveland Reid, an OLLI instructor for Sonoma State and Dominican Universities. In this lecture, we will be discussing Wayne Thieband's versatile and dynamic personality who brough us not only delicious dessert paintings, but also landscapes and figures. In this discussion, we will look at his famous works, review his life, and learn about his extraordinary printmaking skills that are highlighted in the SebArts exhibit. General Admission Tickets are $15.00. Free Public Entry Days Are January 23rd and 24th, and February 21st and 22nd. SebArts Members are granted free entry, and students get $5 off per ticket. Purchase your tickets before the event, or at the door. To schedule a docent led group tour of 6 or more, email RWynne@sebarts.org.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday January 10, 2026 at 10:00 am to Sunday March 8, 2026 at 4:00 pm",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Monoprinting** is a unique expression of printmaking typically painterly in effect, made by applying or painting ink to an historically, copper etching plate.  In contemporary work it can vary from zinc to acrylic or a gel plate, or no plate at all. In contrast to other printing processes, mono-printing creates one final image.  However, it is possible to create a “ghost” print (or lighter print) after the final image - but it is its own image, not identical to the original.  \n\nIn this class, we will use the idea of experimenting, and using drawing, tracing, stencil and the printing presses available to us at the Art Escape to create abstract images from nature and  using recycled materials.  These found materials create all kinds of markings, shapes and images - as they make their way through the press.  Botanicals can compliment the stencils and create openings for more texture, shapes, and imagery to create layered pieces through multiple runs through the press.  When peeling back the paper for the look, it is the surprise element that keeps me coming back to this process.  This process also works well with other printmaking processes.  Using materials like Tyvek that can be traced or cut into shapes and images, we can layer these elements onto the plate or paper and then put through the press over and over again creating repeat images.  While creating interesting artful images that are so intriguing, they might even be considered poetic.",

Surrounding this central work, invited artists contribute pieces that reflect their own relationship to power, resilience, intuition, and selfhood.\n\nRather than offering a single definition, In Her Power invites viewers to witness many expressions of strength — quiet and fierce, ancestral and contemporary, individual and shared.

My father is on a diplomatic assignment with the United Nations to ease tensions on the volatile border between Jordan and Israel. We are transferred from Damacus, Syria, to Jerusalem, Jordan in late 1955. I came to know and love my Bedouin neighbors. They kindly lend me their only donkey. I attend their daughter's wedding and join their family in the Suk to shop in the inner city of Jerusalem. I am envious of their beautiful, embroidered dresses and have fallen deeply in love with my kind and generous neighbors. Ten years ago, I picked up volume number one of \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night\" translated by Sir Richard Francis Burton. The first of sixteen volumes of the stories Shah Razad told her emperor over one thousand nights in order to curtail his slaughter of every young, noble woman in her country. After completing the sixteen volumes of \"Shah Razad\" i felt compelled to continue this extraordinary tradition of storytelling, intended to transmit moral values, by adding my own story: Shah Razad...and the Djinns Who Loved Her.",

    "description": "BoDeans\n\n30 years of Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams\n\n2016 finds the band preparing to release their 13th studio record-Due out in September, while also celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams with a celebratory exhibit on display at the Milwaukee County Historical Society, a limited edition Sprecher beer-BoDeans Original Ginger Brew, and numerous shows, including a much anticipated return to Summerfest – BMO Harris Pavilion on July 3rd.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett has officially declared June 16, 2016 BoDeans Day in Milwaukee! The band will debut a new song, “My Hometown” an ode to Milwaukee, available on iTunes and benefitting the Milwaukee County Historical Society that day. According to Kurt Neumann, the song is a reflection of “Where you were raised...your friends and your family. Your memories. Your sense of being and belonging to somewhere. About the process of going away and coming back to realize that everything you ever needed was always there to begin with.”\n\nBoDeans’ remarkable 30\\+ year musical history is founded upon compelling songs and high energy performances that have earned them an exuberant, loyal, and unpretentious rock and roll following.\n\nMilwaukee’s hometown heroes have been a Summerfest staple since the mid 80’s. Playing to passionate capacity crowds on numerous stages throughout the years-most notably the Marcus Amphitheater on many occasions. The band has shared that stage with many acts including Steve Miller, and Bruce Hornsby and has been honored to have the likes of Train, Chris Isaak, Warren Zevon, Joan Osbourne, and The Wallflowers open for them there. Perhaps one of the longest associations between a locally based artist and major festival, the BoDeans anxiously await their traditional Summerfest shows.\n\nBoDeans have created a sound that helped define a genre and that a generation embraced- songs like “Good Things,” “You Don’t Get Much,” “Idaho,” “If It Makes You,”“Stay,”“All The World,”and “Closer To Free.”\n\nThe band’s accessible adult alternative sound has achieved many milestones, including a Rolling Stone Reader’s Poll For Best New American Band in 1987, support slots with U2, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Tom Petty, George Thorogood, The Pretenders, David Bowie and numerous others. Appearances at Farm Aid, Summerfest, ACL Festival and others, along with TV appearances on “Saturday Night Live,” “Letterman,” “Today,” “Imus,” CNN, and ESPN, to name a few. The BoDeans’ music is featured throughout the new Netflix original series, The Ranch, which premiered in April featuring Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson and Debra Winger.\n\nBoDeans have a permanent installation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland as part of their Midwest Artists exhibit.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

If you cannot attend, please consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffering we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can be a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You do not have to be a \"poet\" or even a \"writer\" to allow words and feelings to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading \"poetic medicine\" sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 years. Her work has created an international community of people who, by listening to and writing poetry together, have healed wounds of grief and loss, helped \"wounded healers,\" and provided resiliency to move forward on our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a meditation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditate is to simply bring oneself back to the breath, each time the mind wanders. In poem-making, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart and along with a deep breath, see if one can open a little bit wider. When we witness each other in this process, in a circle of open-heartedness, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor: Judith Redwing Keyssar, RN has traversed an amazing 35+ year journey in the healing arts/healthcare. Redwing is an educator, end-of-life doula, author, poet, song-writer, ceremonialist, national presenter and frequent contributor to public issues about Palliative and End of Life Care. Redwing is currently the Director of Education at the MERI Center for Education in Palliative Care at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Her professional career includes being the Clinical Director at Zen Hospice Project and the Director of Palliative Care and Nursing at Jewish Family and Children’s Services from 2004-2018. She is a founder and adjunct faculty member of the California State University Shiley/Haynes Institute of Palliative Care, and has taught courses at OLLI at Sonoma State. Redwing is the author of an award-winning book, “Last Acts of Kindness; Lessons for the Living from the Bedsides of the Dying” and is the recipient of numerous awards in the field of Palliative Care. After studying with John Fox at the Institute for Poetic Medicine, her passion for using poetry as a healing modality has led to the development of a successful international program in Poetic Medicine, through her work at the UCSF MERI Center.

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Our trained Educator-Gamemasters guide players in choosing the kinds of stories that interest them, then support unique and dynamic character creation, and finally present an engaging narrative filled with puzzles and mysteries to be solved, social role-play to navigate, and tactical challenges to be overcome… all based on the players’ interests. This uniquely tailored experience provides a rich context of personal investment, and engages our players with a fun and collaborative activity that helps them overcome social and emotional challenges, teaches them to engage with a growth mindset, supports the development of critical thinking and cooperative problem-solving skills, and helps them form lasting bonds with their peers. We hope your child will join us for a new adventure this coming Fall Term at the Sonoma Community Center.\n\nPick-up Service\n\nWe also offer a free pick-up service for your kids if you are unable to drop them off after school.

ABOUT THE BOOK WINNER of the 2025 Tennessee Book Award in Poetry In her second collection, My Infinity, Didi Jackson continues her exploration of the paradoxical meaning of a world where joy and sorrow simultaneously coexist. These poems investigate both sacred and natural spaces. Her poems move grief and emotional suffering to language as a site of recovery and renewal. Much of this collection is ordered around the work of the Swedish visual artist Hilma af Klint. As the first artist to arguably use abstraction, her radical work brims with enigmatic botanical images painted to grasp the seemingly boundless and hermetic realm of the dead. Similarly, Jackson's poems explore plant life and natural species in the Green Mountains of Vermont, where perceived thresholds blur in acts of spiritual reimagining. This is a book that questions all that is endless, all that has been thought as limiting, and all that remains unknown. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Didi Jackson is an American poet and professor. In 2020, she released her debut poetry collection, Moon Jar, and in 2024, she released another titled My Infinity, both with Red Hen Press. She is a professor of creative writing at Vanderbilt University",

Is there such a thing as destiny? What does Judaism say about astrology and the “evil eye”? How does Jewish tradition understand souls and the afterlife?\n\nDrawing on Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah, Jewpernatural offers a grounded, thoughtful approach to topics that often generate curiosity, skepticism, and uncertainty.\n\nThe four sessions include:\n\nDreams & Direction\n\nStars & Signs\n\nJinx & The Evil Eye\n\nPara & Normal (souls, angels, spirits, and the afterlife)\n\n“People are curious about these topics, but they also want serious, authentic answers,” said Rabbi Menachem Landa of Chabad Jewish Center of Novato. “This course helps participants separate myth from meaning and gain practical Jewish perspective for real life.”\n\nThe course is open to all, regardless of background or prior Jewish learning.\n\nEvent Details What: Jewpernatural (4-weekcourse) When: Begins Monday, February 24 Where: Chabad Jewish Center of Novato Format: In person and Zoom Registration: Jewishnovato.com/Jewpernatural Contact: info@Jewishnovato.com",

Originally displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows, this exhibit explores ageism through contemporary art, featuring works by both local youth and senior artists.\n\n*What About Age?* is an art exhibit and educational initiative designed to challenge stereotypes about aging, address ageism and social isolation, and promote intergenerational dialogue through the lens of art.\n\nIn partnership with Youth in Arts, the exhibit features artworks by local youth and senior artists, showcasing how age intersects with creativity, identity, and experience. Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Strengthen your creative process through focused practice.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nIn this class, we will explore composition, value, and other aspects of drawing but on a deeper level. Beginning drawing classes have a lot of ground to cover so the concepts are skimmed over in order to give you exposure to as many as possible. Next-level drawing takes the time to do a deeper dive into some of the principles of drawing. When drawing we use limited tools which allow us to isolate both our strengths and weaknesses. Using this opportunity to really investigate our own process will serve to strengthen all aspects of our creative work. Drawing can be a challenge but when you see how it enhances the creative process, you will know it is worth it. This class is suitable for students who have a basic understanding of drawing and want to work on their skills. Please bring the following materials to class: 20″ x 26″ drawing board with clips, 18 “x 24” Strathmore drawing pad \\(other brands are fine as long as the paper is drawing quality\\), soft willow charcoal, compressed charcoal \\(Char-kole brand black\\), white plastic eraser, notebook, Staedtler drawing pencils 2B and 6B, Pigma micron pens black \\(one fine-tip and one medium-tip\\).Membership has its benefits\n\nAll Silver Memberships and above receive 10% off the registration cost for any class purchase over $40.

    "description": "Meet Your Poetic Cousins & Ancestors This guided review of legacy poets from around the world is an intimate exploration group, meeting to review many fine & famous \\(or infamous, or not-so-famous\\) poets of the past & present who have left a mark on literature, the art of poetry, and society as a whole. JOIN US to discover \\(or re-discover\\) male, female & other poets of all ethnicities. We'll review poets romantic & erotic, political, pastoral & personal, dreamers, ragers, firebrands, sensualists - poets of all colors & stripes - names you will recognize, and \\(we hope\\) many you don't recognise. To keep in touch with interested poets & potential participants, the library will publish this growing list on its website of all the poets currently suggested for review, with a short bio & picture, plus a selection of poems titles for all the poets listed. Our Facebook page will also show reviews & suggestions from participants. We also plan a separate website in the future. On the Second Wednesday of each month, we will gather for a round-table review of several poets, with each participant at that meeting having chosen a poet to explore for the evening. Participants will have unlimited time before the meeting to read about their chosen poet, explore one or more biographies & several poems, and sketch out in advance a piece to read at the next gathering. We will open with a participant reading on of the chosen poet's poems, then we will open a discussion among the participants, after which that participant can read his or her written offering. The next participant will then read a chosen poem, followed by a discussion, as well as his or her written offering. This pattern will follow until all the participants have read - ending at 8pm. Depending on how many people are present, each segment will have to be timed so that everyone can read. A working list at press-time includes: Alex Pushkin Alla Gutnikova Allen Ginsburg Andrei Codrescu Anna Akmatova Cesar Vallejo Dylan Thomas E.E. Cummings Elizabeth Bishop Emerald GoingSnake Federico Garcia Lorca Hannah Arendt Jalal al-Din Rumi Jessie Lamont Jesus Papoleto Melendez Joy Harjo John Berryman Kahlil Gibran Shams Hafez Katrine O Jensen Langston Hughes Maria Stepanova Mary Oliver May Sarton May Swenson Maya Angelou Omar Khayyam Pablo Neruda Silvia Plath Wallace Stevens Vaclev Pavel V.

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nI'm super excited to be able to offer another ladies' Archery night in Santa Rosa! If you've ever had a curiosity about archery, this is your chance to find out more with a fun, interactive lesson.\n\nWe have reserved a special event with the indoor range on a Wednesday evening. It will consist of a basic lesson, and then we all get to practice shooting. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment is provided by them, and we will probably get about an hour or hour and a half to practice.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy). Closed toe shoes recommended.\n\nThere are 17 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event in addition to the regular fee so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of the event. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!",

Each session will start with a demonstration of a specific technique related to functional and/or decorative pottery. Participants are invited to explore new ideas and to try pieces that might be of a more challenging nature. Some of what we can explore are freeform coil pots, soft slab work, hard slab technique, a variety of sculptural techniques and a sampling of the many stamping, carving and textural surface treatments on clay. We will investigate ways to use slips and glaze that will add color to the forms we create.About the Instructor: Michael Citrino has had a love affair with clay for over 50 years. After his college experience at California College of Arts and Crafts with Viola Frey and further work at Humboldt State University with Lew Merrick, he ran a stained glass business for 18 years. Michael and his wife left for Turkey in 1991 to teach in International Schools. For 26 years he taught K-12 art, including Ceramics, Drawing, Photography, Design and Sculpture at schools in six different countries. He started clay programs for High School and Middle School students at three of those schools. At four of these schools he offered after school and weekend ceramics sessions for teachers and parents. Michael’s work ranges from the traditional to the experimental and a wide swath in between. His approach to teaching is to help students explore the playful nature of the clay room and nurture a love for the possibilities that medium presents. \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Under the guidance of Youth in Arts, these emerging and established artists work side by side to create collaborative pieces, fostering meaningful connections between generations and reflecting the exhibit’s core message: art is ageless.\n\nThe exhibit also includes artwork panels by New York-based writer and illustrator Aubrey Hirsch, first displayed at NYU’s Kimmel Windows and originally organized by Stacey Gordon, NYU’s Program Director of Next Phase Adult Caregiving and Retirement at Work Life.\n\nThe new exhibition will be on view at the Marin County Civic Center galleries from January 26 to May 6, 2026. Works will be displayed on the first and third floor exhibits, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe *What About Age?* art exhibit is presented by Marin Cultural Association in partnership with Marin Community Foundation and Youth in Arts. Beyond the art exhibit, the *What About Age?* initiative offers programming, led by Vivalon, designed to challenge ageism and provide resources for Marin County's growing aging population.",

    "description": "Instructor: Maggie Parr\nThursday mornings from February 19th-March12th\n10:00 am-1:00 pm\n$225 + materials\nLimited to 10 students (first 4 students to register get a free ½ hour private consult with\nMaggie)\n\nOil painting doesn’t have to be intimidating! In just four weeks, students will paint a portrait in the indirect style, starting with a grey value study, building up with layers, and finishing with powerful details. The final result always surprises people: just by following basic rules, anyone can create a beautiful oil portrait that glows. Even abstract\npainters can benefit from learning these techniques. Knowing how oil painting works give us more confidence to develop our own authentic creative voice. As Maggie says, “You gotta learn the rules to break the rules.”\n\n\nMaggie Parr started her career destroying Lichtenstein prints that didn’t make the edition at Gemini G.E.L., where she learned that the behemoth art market would not be conducive to her spiritual and personal paintings. She started working as a show designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where for the next three decades, she designed theme park attractions around the world. She also expanded into book illustration, murals, portraits,\ncomics, and eventually, writing books and scripts for television. Along the way, she studied with master teachers like Steve Huston, Jeremy Lipking, and\nJoseph Q. Daily. She spent years experimenting to find her own creative voice—a fusion of expressionism and realism. She got an MFA and taught at the college level, then developed her own teaching methods for private and group study.\n\nToday, Maggie maintains a thriving business creating custom art and designs for corporations, individuals, and non-profits. She teaches other artists to utilize classical rendering techniques so they can confidently break the rules in the service of their own\nwork. And she coaches creatives in search of deeper authenticity, healing, and self- actualization.\n\nPlease follow the link to register for this class https://www.parrcreate.com/page/676799 www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159 https://www.parrcreate.com/page/691159",

These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

Join our hands-on Trashion workshop for the Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction.\n\nAbout the Class\n\nThis hands-on workshop invites participants to rescue and reinvent plastic dolls \\(Barbies, Kens, and dolls that are under 12 inches\\) often destined for landfills, where they can take 20 to 500 years to decompose. As part of Trashion Season, join us for the beloved Gallery 212 Exhibit and Auction \\(April 3 – 25\\) where discarded materials are transformed into small-scale works of art for a good cause. Together, we’ll reclaim these forgotten figures and reimagine them as expressive, one-of-a-kind artworks for submission to the gallery exhibit and auction. New this year: Bags! In addition to dolls, we’re expanding the exhibit to include bags—think totes, clutches, cross bagsm fanny packs, coin purses, and backpacks. Just like the Trashion runway, the only rule is that your piece must be made from unconventional materials and/or upcycled/used textiles. Participants will have access to access to sewing machines, hot glue guns, irons, hair dryers and other creative tools as well of a wide selection of trash and upcycled materials to bring their vision to life. BYOT \\(Bring your own trash\\) is also welcome and encouraged! The workshop registration is your application fee to the gallery exhibit! Come play, experiment, and collaborate while contributing to a dynamic gallery exhibit that raises funds for Sonoma Community Center programming through the auction. It’s a joy to see your art find a new home—and to be part of a creative community turning trash into treasure.\n\nThank you to Recology Sonoma-Marin for donating Barbies & Dolls for our gallery exhibit every year.",

Delicate plum, azalea, camellia, cherry, and apricot bonsai take center stage, their blossoms appearing just as winter begins to yield to spring. These early bloomers symbolize hope and renewal—reminding us that beauty and resilience can emerge even in the coldest months.\n\nThe exhibition also draws inspiration from hanami, the centuries-old Japanese tradition of celebrating the fleeting beauty of blossoms. The Garden invites visitors to participate in this art of flower appreciation through Hanami Strolls—guided walks through the Garden’s Asian woodland where early-blooming magnolias, cherries, and camellias offer their own ephemeral display.",

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.**\n\nSonoma County artist, **Tosya Shore,** presents **Celebrating Women,** paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features **Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air,** a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448.

Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**with Pawan Bareja, PhD**\n\nWhen we are out of alignment with our deepest heart values, life feels stressful. Whether the trigger is personal heartbreak, economic pressure, relational conflict, or the weight of the climate crisis, the body often reacts with anxiety, collapse, anger, or overwhelm long before the mind can make sense of it. You are invited to move from stress to love by transforming these patterns through embodied heart practices.\n\nEach week, we will begin by gently noticing where activation lives in the body. We’ll then engage in embodied heart-opening practices to soothe the nervous system and reconnect with inner clarity. After practice, we will re-check the nervous system to observe what has shifted, revealing resilience as something softly felt, measurable, and trainable.\n\nAs the heart opens and the body softens, many experience deeper rest, clearer thinking, a renewed sense of connection to loved ones, and the courage to live a more meaningful life.",

This is skating unbound: athletic, cinematic, and wildly alive.\n\nReaching 14 cities in early 2026, this is the rare chance to witness the possibilities of performance dance on ice. IDI's Artistic Director Douglas Webster says &ldquo;THE SEASONS isn't just a show&mdash;it's a pulse, a spark, a reminder that when blades meet music and movement meets heart, the ice itself begins to sing.&rdquo; \n\nEdge Class details: The edge class are meant to be community events that allow an opportunity to skate and warm up with the IDI company. Skills required are a solid ability of forwards and backwards skating/cross overs, all basic edges and turns through forward and backward 3s. Classes will develop past 3 turns into more advanced exercises. Both youth and adults are welcome. These classes are not learn to skate classes and advance at a rapid pace.\n\nMeet and Greets follow the show and are a chance for VIP ticket holders to get autographs and photos with the IDI cast members.

Speaker Bio: As California Program Manager for Wildlands Network, Mari develops collaborative and strategic partnerships to further policy, road ecology, and land use initiatives that promote wildlife corridors and core habitat protections throughout the State of California. Mari spent her childhood on a farm in the San Joaquin Valley of California and her summers in the Sierra Nevada, near Ebbetts Pass. Her outdoor exposure inspired her to earn her bachelor's degree in environmental science from Humboldt State University. After college, she rode her bike across the U.S. and lived off the grid in Hawaii before taking a job coordinating settlements at a personal injury law firm in downtown San Francisco to gain exposure to the practice of law. In 2017, she attended the University of Oregon and obtained her law degree in 2020 and became licensed to practice law in both Oregon and California the following year. Mari lives in the San Joaquin Valley. When not strategizing a connected California, you'll find her with her dog, Bodie, either backpacking, trail running, cooking, practicing piano, brewing beer, gardening, or sketching.",

What we do not yet understand shapes our view and obscures freedom. What are the processes by which we realize and align with our deepest knowing?\n\nTogether, we’ll consider the various aspects of the Dharma path that help us wake up to the assumptions that shape our experience and behavior: deep attention, spiritual friendship, and surrendering to this moment. We’ll reflect on what we’ve known in our clearest moments and what truly matters in how we relate to life. Together we’ll open to our embodied experience of wise view and how it supports meeting each moment with wisdom and love.\n\nDuring this day of practice, we’ll offer guided and silent meditation practice, Dharma reflections, and time for dialogue. All are welcome.",

You’ll learn techniques ranging from delicate pasta-making to elegant appetizers and classic Italian desserts. Start by creating pillowy ricotta gnudi, those cloud-like dumplings that are lighter than traditional gnocchi, served with a vibrant tomato sauce. Master the art of achieving the perfect texture and learn how to handle the delicate dough for consistently beautiful results. Next, prepare whipped ricotta crostini topped with honey and fresh thyme, an elegant appetizer that balances creamy, sweet, and herbaceous flavors on crispy bread. Finally, you’ll bake torta di ricotta romana, a traditional Roman ricotta cake that’s subtly sweet and wonderfully moist. This classic dessert demonstrates how ricotta creates tender, delicate baked goods with authentic Italian character. Throughout the class, you’ll gain confidence working with fresh ricotta, understanding how its moisture content and handling affect each dish differently. Whether you’re looking to expand your Italian cooking repertoire or simply love ricotta, this class provides techniques and recipes you’ll return to again and again.

Take part in the Gallery’s free monthly drawing for a beautiful work by a Gallery artist.  Refreshments will be served.\n\nSonoma County artist, Tosya Shore, presents Celebrating Women, paintings that commemorate women in honor of Women’s History Month. Shore’s watercolor works capture women in their element, showing the multiple facets of their lives.  These dynamic paintings break away with strong shapes and interlacing patterns that draw the viewer in exciting ways.  A la Degas, we catch a ballet dancer lacing her shoes in “Good Point.”  The artist takes us into nature with “Redwood Rendezvous” where dominant trunk shapes frame a couple enjoying a glorious forest scene.    “Just Back from Vegas” captures a fleeting view of elegance as the woman in question catches her breath.  “There’s such special feeling in these everyday moments, I love to turn the mundane into magic – women deserve nothing less,” noted Shore. \n\nMeet the artist: Shore will be hosting the Gallery on March 5 and 19 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\n The Stairway Smallworks Showcase features Donna Schaffer’s Ooh La La, Plein Air, a collection unveiling oil paintings made on her recent trip to France.  Roaming the streets of Paris, toting paints and palette, Schaffer captured iconic scenes buzzing with “la belle vie.” The viewer catches a true cultural vibe in “Café le Bistro”, the site of a favored hangout for espresso and conversation.  One is awed by the structure rising from the ground-level trees in Schaffer’s unique view of the Eiffel Tower in “Paris is for Lovers.” “Every day was an adventure in Paris – I hope through these plein air vignettes, to share the excitement of being there”, stated Schaffer.\n\nMeet the artist: Schaffer will be hosting the Gallery on March 21 and 22 from 11am to 6 pm.\n\nUpstairs Art Gallery, 306 Center Street, Healdsburg, CA 95448. \\(707\\) 431-4214.: OPEN DAILY: 11am – 6 pm.    www.upstairsart gallery.net \n\nFor further information: Contact: Beverly Bird, Press Contact, at bvdrio@sonic.net or 707-799-1490.",

    "description": "Maija Peeples-Bright is one of the few women artists associated with Northern California's Funk Art movement of the late 1960s and '70s. Peeples-Bright's wildly inventive practice comprises robust compositions bustling with animals of all kinds-her \"beasties\" as she calls them-forming surreal, imaginative landscapes in audacious impasto. Her zoological arrangements represent alternate realities, infusing exuberance and a sense of the absurd into impossible scenarios. Highly distinctive, her textural creature patterns revel in the extreme, often taking up every inch of the canvas, multiplying her beasties into dizzying arrangements. Peeples-Bright invites us into a decadence-gone-wild world all her own. The exhibition will feature a retrospective look at Peeples-Bright's career, from her early days of the Funk Movement to today.",

    "description": "**Reclaim Your Calm: Sound, Breath, & Flow**\n\nJoin us for a unique somatic experience that uses the hypnotic, melodic resonance of the Rav Vast drum to bathe your nervous system in healing frequencies. Unlike traditional drumming, the Rav Vast creates a “sound forest” of overtones that helps the mind settle and the body soften. In this session, we integrate: Vibrational Sound Bath: The ethereal tones of the Rav Vast to lower your heart rate. Somatic Humming: To physically vibrate the vagus nerve from the inside out, syncing your breath with the drum. Flowing Qigong: Gentle, meditative movements to move “Qi” (energy) and release physical bracing in the body. Experience the shift from “survival mode” to “serenity.” Denise will guide you through: Qigong to open the body’s energy channels. Humming to stimulate your internal “calm” switch. A Rav Vast Sound Bath to wash away tension with beautiful, resonant harmonics. Come home to your body. Leave feeling grounded, peaceful, and renewed.\n\n**About Denise Aubin, MQT**\n\nDenise Aubin is a certified Medical Qigong Therapist (MQT) and the founder of Dance of Qigong. She discovered Qigong many years ago while traveling her own healing path and has a passion for assisting others on their healing journey back to love. Qigong is all about loving yourself and reconnecting with your joy. Denise loves teaching and empowering others in this ancient art form of self healing exercises. Denise received her degree from the International Institute of Medical Qigong and received certification as a Medical Qigong Therapist. Denise has been a teacher and healer for over thirty years.",

Come brave the perilous waters of Point Reyes and join us for a rollicking good time at Point Reyes National Seashore's Sea Chantey Sing-along at the Ken Patrick Visitor Center. Please bring your arsenal of sea chanteys, any musical instruments you'd like, and a willingness to laugh a lot!  It's so much fun when audience members lead shanties for the rest of us to join in on the chorus, and leading a song is encouraged! If you'd like to find a song \\(or songs\\) to share, I highly recommend setting one of your online music services to a sea chantey radio station and hear what's out there! Practice lyrics! Teach the chorus to our audience at the singalong! Our format is informal, mellow, and supportive, so if you've been wanting to push your comfort edge and lead a song, this is a perfect low-pressure opportunity. If you'd rather just singalong with the chantey choruses, that's fine too. We always have a great time no matter what. This free event is for chantey singers of all levels. Due to the nature of sea chanteys, there may be lyrics that are not appropriate for children. Reservations not required. To be added to the notification email list for future singalong dates, please email pore\\_info@nps.gov For more information, please visit: nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/calendar.htm",

Over the course of six months, filled with laughter, hilarious misadventures, and the occasional liquid refreshment, these middle-aged women successfully bond and find the confidence to jump start their new lives. Together, they discover lasting friendships and a renewed determination to live in the moment—and most importantly, realize it’s never too late to make new old friends.",

Local artist Tara Dickinson will be leading us as a group through creating a cork board masterpiece.\n\nEvent fee ($45) includes artist instruction and your personal cork art piece, invite your friends to join us! Please bring all those corks you have saved and don't quite know what to do with. If you don't have any, that's fine too. Let us know in the comments section so we can bring extra.\n\nVino is made available by K Squared for a separate fee *(by the flight or glass)*. The owner, Andrew, will be on hand to serve wine and entertainment.\n\nAbout the Cellars: After spending his first 9 years in the wine industry at Charles Krug Winery in St. Helena, Andrew Moore developed a passion for crafting small lot, premium wines. In 2010, with a \"the wine glass is half full\" type of attitude, Andrew's plans for owning his own winery began with a single barrel of Russian River Pinot Noir produced at home.\n\nIn 2015 K Squared Cellars acquired winery and tasting room space. That single barrel of Pinot Noir and a dream of having their own family winery was realized!\n\nAbout the Artist: Tara Dickinson is our artist and instructor. She has a background in fine arts and years of teaching expressive art labs to all ages. She enjoys sharing tools to help everyone feel comfortable in the creative process while learning new techniques. She moved to Santa Rosa in late 2021 after growing up mostly in FL and is loving the California lifestyle.\n\nWear your artsy clothing, bring your thirst, and corks for this 2-3 hour event.\n\n* Pre-payment *(via Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal)* is required for this limited availability event. **[PLS REGISTER/PAY HERE!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHYNFReJbhlLGQh0_wl4dEJZlF3E4nmEobQzB2W93XO7tz9g/viewform?usp=publish-editor)**\n* Maximum of 20 people, **guests welcome.**\n* We suggest dressing warmly or in layers as the cellar will be a bit cold at this time.\n\nThe event starts promptly at 1:30 pm.\nPlease be a little bit early to get settled in with your wine and supplies. Tara will follow up with everyone who RSVP's 'Yes' to complete payment through her above link.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you all for this fun event in March!\nCheers!\n\\- Joleen and Dai",

She was a production potter for five years. The current focus of her “art” is the sheer pleasure of playful engagement with clay.

Using scissors we will remove parts of the boxes until we have what we will use as our cover. Then using miscellaneous papers we fold these into the pages of our journals. With simple book-binding skills using a needle and waxed thread we will stitch the pages into our covers. We will also decorate the covers of our journals with collage papers and/or paint.Examples of completed journals will be shown and step by step instruction will be provided along with all supplies. Short exercises to boost your creativity, journal prompts, and a small gift from me are also included.Whether you are a beginning or seasoned artist/writer/crafter or just looking to try something new, this is a great way to get inspired and create something meaningful to you.About the Instructor: Rendell Hourigan received a BBA in Marketing from Texas Tech University, and has pursued art for over 25 years, focusing on sustainable mixed media.

They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!",

    "description": "Instructor: Jan Lochner\nSaturday, March 28th\n2:00PM-5:00PM\nSanta Rosa Location\n$35.00\n\nThis is a hands on make and take class where you will make at least five items including a bookmark, a greeting card, a fridge magnet and an ornament. The class will use two different techniques and Jan will explain how to press flowers and which flowers hold their color best. It is a creative experience!\n\n\nTo register for this workshop, please contact Jan at: freshpressedflowercards@yahoo.com mailto:freshpressedflowercards@yahoo.com\n\nCreating note cards from pressed flowers has been Jan’s hobby for 25 years, though she has no formal art training. She utilizes color,\nshape and texture on fine quality paper, each card uniquely handmade. Jan’s home in Sebastopol is her studio: the dining room table is her workshop, the kitchen cupboards storing boxes and trays of flowers. She buy card stock by the thousand and pick blooms from her garden and other public places. Her family is used to me saying, “could we stop for just a few minutes so I can gather some… ”\n\nIt is a wonderful way of life.\n\n*A note to all students: Please park on in the East facing parking lot while attending classes. We greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",

This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance their drawing skills - beginners, those who haven’t practiced in years, or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill that anyone can be taught, practice, and hone. Through demonstration, practice, and reflective discussion, this class will explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills, if you feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice, or if you simply want to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin, this is the class for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts with an emphasis on drawing and printmaking from University of San Diego, then attended University of Hawaii at Manoa to receive her MFA in printmaking. Hannah’s etchings have been internationally shown and collected, but her personal practice also includes paper cutting, graphite, watercolor, mixed media, and murals. She have taught all ages and many formats (kids, teens, adults, college, private lessons, camps, etc) and many mediums. These days Hannah has been teaching primarily paper cutting but also enjoys teaching drawing, painting and printmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Bring a copy of your receipt at check-in to Painting/Drawing Studio adjacent to Ceramics StudioJoin us for a monthly, heart-centered gathering where we come together to create Jizo guardians out of clay—symbols of compassion, protection, and peace. Rooted in the Buddhist tradition and echoed across many cultures, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and all who have passed, those in transition, and those in distress.This ongoing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war, with a special focus now on the approximately 19,000 children who have perished in Israel and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple, meditative act of working with clay, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public exhibits and peace sites, offering spaces for reflection, mourning, and hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each month at SebArts, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to ages 12 - adult, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.There is no fee for this class; donations are welcome to help cover materials and expenses. More than a class, this is a shared space of warmth and care—an opportunity to tend to our own hearts while taking part in love in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

Due to time and space considerations, wheel-throwing will not be demonstrated on site. Instead, pre-thrown pot bodies will be prepared as starting points. The workshop will center on shaping small components such as knobs, spouts, and handles, including hand-building techniques for forming these parts, as well as methods for attaching them harmoniously to the body. The instructor will also share practical tool tips to help participants work confidently with fine details and achieve a polished finish. This workshop is recommended to be held shortly after the instructor’s arrival.Due to limited capacity of the Ceramics Studio, we are asking for a suggested donation of $10 to confirm your attendance. About the Artist: Ping Zhong’s artistic practice is a continuous exploration of regeneration—of materials, forms, and cultural narratives. She investigates the dialogue between ancient Chinese pottery and contemporary visual language, using wheel-throwing, hand-building, and sculpture to create works in which history and personal growth converge. This reinterpretation of classical forms is not only an artistic method, but also a philosophical inquiry into the harmony between past and future. Deeply motivated to uncover the potential within clay, Ping pushes the boundaries of design and technique. Her work reflects on universal themes: the individual’s place within the community, the relationship between essence and appearance, and the evolving connection between nature and society. Through these explorations, she seeks to create art that resonates across cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n          \n            \n              Add to cart",

    "description": "Sonoma County Women's Wine Club (SCWWC)\nJoin us for an axe-throwing session to blow off some steam. I'm super excited to be able to offer a ladies' Axe-throwing night in Santa Rosa. If you've ever had a curiosity about this fun activity, this is your chance to find out more!\n\nWe have reserved a group spot with the indoor range on a Wednesday night. It will consist of an introductory lesson, and then we all get to practice taking turns. Everyone will get ample time to practice, as they have many lanes.\n\nThis event is focused on a less-competitive, relaxed, and entertaining atmosphere. All skill levels are encouraged. All equipment and targets are provided by them, and we will probably get about 1 to 2 hours to enjoy ourselves.\n\nI encourage everyone to bring a bottle of wine or a snack to share with the rest of the group (We usually end up with a lovely charcuterie and wine spread for everyone to enjoy).\n\nThere are 10 spots available, guests welcome. The ladies' group lesson and event is $30 person, paid to the range. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash. There may be standard liability forms to be filled out with the range. Closed-toed shoes are recommended.\n\nPlease only RSVP 'Yes' if you are able to make it, I will be doing a final headcount the day of. There is an attendance policy for all our events: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nCheers, and hope to see you there!",

    "description": "Instructor: Suzanne Carson\n\nThursdays 11 am - 1 pm\n\nBeginning March 19\n\nFee: $30/Session/Ongoing\n\nDrawing a Portrait is Challenging and Fun!\n\nPortraits have always been my forte. I spent many years as a quick sketch portrait artist and later studied classical and impressionistic portraits.\n\nThis class will have projects and demos covering basic head structure and features, how to get a likeness and capture those qualities that make a portrait unique. We will also explore different portrait styles in art history.\n\nUsing photo references, we will begin with pencil and charcoal before using color. Students can work on their own projects as well. Beginning to advanced students.\n\nTo enroll please call or text Suzanne at 707-888-2083",

She has recorded more than 25 albums and has lent her talents to countless fellow artists’ recordings. In recognition of her remarkable career, Harris was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. \nHarris is one of the most admired and influential women in music. She has recorded with such diverse artists as Linda Ronstadt, Daniel Lanois, Bob Dylan, Mark Knopfler, Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Roy Orbison, Ryan Adams, Beck, Elvis Costello, Johnny Cash, Lucinda Williams, Lyle Lovett and Rodney Crowell. Few artists have achieved such honesty or have revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career, Harris continues to share the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

Jan’s home in Sebastopol is her studio: the dining room table is her workshop, the kitchen cupboards storing boxes and trays of flowers. She buy card stock by the thousand and pick blooms from her garden and other public places. Her family is used to me saying, “could we stop for just a few minutes so I can gather some… ”\n\nIt is a wonderful way of life.\n\n*A note to all students: Please park on in the East facing parking lot while attending classes.

They have generously offered to host our monthly THIRSTY THURSDAY social for us.\n\nIf you are new to the area, or just looking to get out of the house and make new friends, this is the place for you. Welcoming to ALL new and (ahem, old) members.\n\nWine is purchased by the glass for a set fee of $13/$14 per glass with the variety of white, rosé, and red wines offered through 4th Street Cellars which includes tip. Fees are collected at the venue by Co-organizer Daima Phipps via cash, Venmo, or Paypal. You are welcome to purchase wine separately if you choose. Starting March 2025, we ask that every attending member pay a $1 \"slush\" fund fee per event so that we can build up our funds for club-related expenses, which can be paid by Venmo or cash.\n\nThere is no food offered, but you are welcome to bring an appetizer or snack to share with the group, and many ladies do. We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months. Please put this event in your calendar so you don't miss out or get dinged. A No-Show is when you are on the 'Going' list, but do not show up.\n\nSee you there, ready to kickoff!",

His latest two albums, Making Memories and Sessions, were released in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The albums featured new and never-before recorded songs as well as new takes on old classics, notably “Put Your Head On My Shoulder,” with Olivia Newton John, one of her last recorded songs, and “My Way,” featuring Michael Buble and Andrea Bocelli. \n\n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

It follows a critically lauded debut album, See You Around, and standalone singles, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene, Watkins, Jarosz, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival, then co-founded I’m With Her, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative, fable-like storytelling, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity, access, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa.

Guests are invited to sip, savor, and connect—meeting the winemakers behind the pours and tasting dishes that reflect the rich agricultural and cultural diversity of the North Coast. \nFrom elegant caviar to bold barbecue and globally inspired flavors, the culinary offerings are as diverse as they are delicious, all complemented by live music and the vibrant energy of wine country. As festival attendee Dennis McCarter of McCarter Cellars shared, “The great food at the event elevates the great wine, and the great wine elevates the great food.” Established as a must-attend event for food and wine lovers alike, the North Coast Wine & Food Festival is more than a tasting—it’s a joyful celebration of craftsmanship, community, and the good life. \nMust be 21 or older to attend. \nDesignated driver tickets are available, along with a limited selection of non-alcoholic beverages. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.

We will have time to socialize while tasting in the room upstairs to the left or the outside patio if the weather is nice.\n\nThe space has a 25 person attendee limit, but the list is open to 40 to eliminate a waitlist, and guests are welcome! Please RSVP below only if you are able to make it, we have an attendance policy: if you No-Show to three events, you may not attend events for the next three months.

Formed by multi-talented musician and producer Leonid Vorobyev, the group features elite vocalists and instrumentalists from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, and beyond, all united by a shared passion for celebrating this iconic era of music. \nOriginally conceived as a studio project in Moscow, Leonid & Friends skyrocketed to international fame when their note-perfect video covers went viral online, earning praise from members of Chicago themselves. What began as a YouTube phenomenon has since evolved into a world-class touring act, captivating audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. \nWith more than 500 million combined video views, multiple sold-out U.S. tours, and a devoted global fanbase, the band is beloved worldwide for honoring the classics, while expanding far beyond them \n\n\nAfter-show Meet & Greet\nMeet & Greet is a wonderful opportunity for fans to meet and interact with Leonid & Friends. Quantity is limited at each show. Shortly after the concert, attendees with a M&G wristband will be allowed to meet the band, have a group photo taken, and the opportunity to chat with band members and have merchandise or memorabilia signed.\n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand. Platinum Tickets are not part of VIP packages – they are tickets only. \nPlatinum Seating provides fans with direct access to securing some of the best seats in the venue at market value. The market value for Platinum Seating is subject to change based on the overall demand and popularity for the event.  Platinum Seating allows fans to purchase tickets in a safe and secure environment without running the risk of purchasing tickets that may be considered lost, stolen, or counterfeit. \n\n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.",

    "description": "Back to All Shows\n\n\nEmporium Presents\nBrad Williams: The Tall Tales Tour\n\nSunday, November 29, 2026\n\n7:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \nPound for pound, Brad Williams is the funniest comedian in the country right now and has become one of the most in-demand comedians working today. His humorous and inspiring observations on disability, relationships, sex, and race consistently win over audiences, proving anyone can overcome their shortcomings. \nWilliams started doing stand-up comedy as a teenager and has been touring successfully ever since, routinely selling out prestigious venues all over the country and world. He has parlayed his live performances into a multitude of stand-up television appearances, including The Tonight Show, Dave Attell’s Comedy Underground, and Jimmy Kimmel Live. His comedy specials include Fun Size, the highest rated special on Showtime, and Daddy Issues, which was even more successful. For his third special, he hosted some of the edgiest comedians in the country from the prestigious Montreal Just For Laughs Festival. His last groundbreaking special on Netflix, The Degenerates, garnered more huge ratings and rave reviews. \n\n\nPlatinum Tickets are tickets that are dynamically priced up and down based on demand. Platinum Tickets are not part of VIP packages – they are tickets only. \nPlatinum Seating provides fans with direct access to securing some of the best seats in the venue at market value. The market value for Platinum Seating is subject to change based on the overall demand and popularity for the event.  Platinum Seating allows fans to purchase tickets in a safe and secure environment without running the risk of purchasing tickets that may be considered lost, stolen, or counterfeit. \n\n \n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices. The only safe way to protect your purchase and guarantee the best seats at the lowest cost is to work directly with us: through our website, by phone, or at our box office in Santa Rosa. Plus, we’re not bots. Our friendly team members are easily accessible by phone or at the box office to provide customer support.",
