SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents ZZ Ward
DESCRIPTION:February 25\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nOne of the most profound lessons ZZ Ward learned from growing up listening to the blues greats was to be authentic to your story. When the LA-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist began to write new music\, she found herself in the midst of one of the biggest life changes a person will ever experience: motherhood. The resulting music is her truest and most blues-infused to date. Freed from the pop pressures of her previous major label\, ZZ is able to fully embrace the blues\, her most formative influence. Her Sun Records debut\, Liberation\, features a program of originals and re-imagined blues favorites done in ZZ’s singular way. Encompassing greasy Chicago blues\, foot-stomping Delta blues\, rootsy garage rock\, and vintage soul\, the album is almost a ZZ-curated survey of the blues. The 14-track album was produced by multi-platinum producer Ryan Spraker (Eli “Paperboy” Reed\, Weezer\, In This Moment). ZZ’s first single\, “Put The Gun Down\,” from her 2012 debut\, Til the Casket Drops\, broke into the AAA Radio Charts Top 10\, and stayed there for 10 weeks. It was followed by the\nsingle\, “365 Days\,” which hit #2 on the charts. Til the Casket Drops also snuck into the Billboard Top 40 Alternative Chart. ZZ’s sophomore album\, The Storm\, released in 2017\, peaked at Number 1 on the Billboard Blues Charts\, highlighted by singles featuring GRAMMY-Award winners Fantastic Negrito\, “Cannonball\,” and Gary Clark Jr.\, “Ride\,” which was also the end title song for Pixar’s feature film Cars 3. This past summer ZZ was personally picked by Slash to open the tour for his own blues album.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Ambrosia with support from HAMES
DESCRIPTION:February 27\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nSupport: HAMES \nAmbrosia\, the band known and loved by a multitude of fans since the 1970’s\, is now more alive and compelling than ever. This 5-time Grammy Nominated ensemble is exploring new musical territory and bringing an exceptional musical performance to stages everywhere. \nIn 1970\, four young musicians from the South Bay of Los Angeles\, came together to create a new moving and invigorating style of music. Joseph Puerta\, Christopher North\, David Pack\, and Burleigh Drummond produced a sound that was immediately recognized. Today\, Ambrosia is three of the original members with the addition of guitarist Doug Jackson\, contributing keyboardist Mary Harris\, and powerful lead vocals of Kipp Lennon (from the band Venice). \nAlways exploring the possibilities of progressive\, classical\, and world influences – with tangled roots of soul\, rhythm\, and blues – Ambrosia is continuing to entertain their original fans while still engaging newer audiences. \nOriginally labeled as America’s answer to the progressive invasion of English acts Yes and King Crimson\, the group quickly proved itself with a unique blend of aural landscapes. Their musical styles attracted the collaboration with cultural icons Leonard Bernstein\, Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\, Alan Parsons\, Bruce Hornsby\, Michael McDonald\, Edgar Winter\, Dave Mason\, Gary Wright\, Al Stewart\, and others. Ambrosia had toured extensively with Fleetwood Mac\, Heart\, and the Doobie Brothers. \nDuring Ambrosia’s early recording history they garnered 5 Grammy Nominations\, received frequent radio airplay\, and gained the admiration and respect of the musical community – in addition to their sold out concerts around the world. Ambrosia achieved 5 Top 40 hit singles on Warner Bros. Records\, released between 1975 and 1980\, including “How Much I Feel” and “Biggest Part of Me”. In 2015 the group released a new single\, “Hopes and Dreams”\, which was featured on the series called The Sparrows that aired on the Fox television channel. \n  \n

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Silversun Pickups - Tenterhooks Tour with special guest Pure Hex
DESCRIPTION:March 7\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 6:30pm/ Show 7:30pm\nAges: 12+ \nSilversun Pickups Soundcheck Package\nPurchase Here\nIncludes:\n-One general admission ticket\n-Early entry into the venue\n-Access to an intimate preshow soundcheck with Silversun Pickups\n-Q&A with Silversun Pickups\n-Silversun Pickups Vinyl\n-Commemorative VIP laminate; autographed by SSPU\n-Priority merchandise shopping\n-Limited availability \nSilversun Pickups’ sixth album Physical Thrills came together as a serendipitous accident during a dark time. The LA band began 2020 by touring in support of their record released the previous year\, Widow’s Weeds. But the pandemic halted those plans\, with the members including guitarist and singer Brian Aubert\, bassist Nikki Monninger\, drummer Christopher Guanlao\, and keyboardist Joe Lester\, finding themselves stuck at home. In that resting period\, Aubert wasn’t focused on Silversun Pickups; instead\, he channeled his energy into taking care of his son\, Nico\, while his wife Tracy worked. \nBut as much as his focus initially shifted from the band\, he couldn’t escape the new melodies germinating in his head. “I would sneak off and start writing these songs\, and I didn’t know what they’re for because I didn’t really think about Silversun on any level. I was just doing it to keep myself calm and keep myself company\,” says Aubert. The songs were so different from what he’d previously written for Silversun Pickups that he initially thought he was writing a musical. There were “dream shanties\,” gentler vocals\, horror-inspired sounds\, and other exciting new elements coming to mind. \nThe band finally was able to gather in person for a live-streamed acoustic performance on Halloween for The Dark Zone Network’s virtual music festival Queen Mary\, and it was there that Aubert revealed the new material to his bandmates. They readily embraced the new direction—and so did producer Butch Vig. The band reunited with Vig\, who first worked with Silversun Pickups on Widow’s Weeds\, recording the record at the famed producer and Garbage member’s home. \nWhen Aubert first reached out to Vig\, he wasn’t sure if the band was making an EP or a full record; Widow’s Weeds was still fresh for Silversun Pickups. But once Aubert made plans to visit Vig and play him what he had\, the music began pouring out. He immediately began recording with Vig\, later having the rest of the band join. \nOnce the band began working on Physical Thrills together\, they made some of Silversun Pickups’ most stunning songs yet. The record doesn’t depart drastically from the sound the band’s fans know and love\, but rather enhances it with previously-unexplored fixtures at play. \nPhysical Thrills was colored by the pandemic\, but isn’t meant to be solemn; instead\, Aubert explores his own comfort in the temporary\, newfound isolation. There’s a juxtaposition of playfulness with angst from having so much time to process untapped emotions. That’s something that comes through in the album’s instrumentation\, too\, with wide-ranging sounds that transform according to the weight of the lyrics. \nThere are tracks with shoegaze-infused distorted synths and guitar\, like opener “Stillness (Way Beyond)”; bouncy\, pop-tinged danceable tunes (“Empty Nest\,” “Hereafter (Way After)”); pared-down ballads (“Alone On A Hill”); and a collection of “dream shanties\,” as Aubert refers to them. \nThe titles of those shanties call back to “Dream At Tempo 119” off the band’s 2006 debut record\, Carnavas\, tying the band’s beginnings with the current\, evolved iteration of Silversun Pickups. But\, this time\, the instrumentation matches the lyrics. Aubert forgoes the heavy guitars to instead create magical lullabies: “Dream At Tempo 050\,” “Dream At Tempo 310\,” and “Dream At Tempo 150.” Each carries a secret code in the title with numbers personal to Aubert. \nWith such an exploratory record\, the band members felt free to traverse new ground. Guanlao\, who usually shies away from fills on drums\, took inspiration from The Beatles documentary Get Back\, throwing some into Physical Thrills\, influenced by Ringo Starr’s work on Let It Be. Whereas for Monninger\, this record allowed her to showcase her vocals at the forefront more than in previous work. Joe also took a larger role in composition on this record\, writing the piano part for “We Won’t Come Out\,” which became the backbone for the song. \nThe making of Physical Thrills also allowed for whimsical moments\, including Aubert creating a distinct tapping noise by incorporating the sound of drumsticks hitting Vig’s Grammy in “Hidden Moon\,” and playfully pelting balloons at Monninger while she played “Hereafter (Way After)” on bass to create less tension. \nWhile this record features such an eclectic mix of melodies\, each song is interconnected with each other\, meant to be experienced as a whole body of work. “All of our records are designed for people who want to listen to them all the way through and hopefully stick around with it\,” says Aubert. “After a while\, maybe you’ll catch on to the little things—not just the [pattern of] the dream songs\, but maybe you’ll hear that\, and you’ll hear a melody from the first song in the last song. There are crossover things happening.” \nLester says\, “Physical Thrills is exactly the record that we wanted to make\, which I’m really stoked about because sometimes you look back and think\, ‘Well\, that’s maybe not exactly how we would have done it’ when you go back and listen to it years later.’ But I feel really proud of this one. I think the songs that Nikki sings on are like the best ones we’ve done for her to sing on. The lyrics are better than they’ve ever been.” \nMonninger adds\, “We’ve been together for twenty-two years; it’s really interesting that we still love doing this. We know that we’re fortunate to still be together after all these years\, seeking out the silver lining. I feel like we still have many more things to say\, and we’re so happy with how this album turned out.”

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents George Thorogood and The Destroyers “The Baddest Show On Earth”
DESCRIPTION:March 10\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nDuring 2025’s The Baddest Show on Earth Tour\, they played nearly 90 explosive shows\, were honored by The Recording Academy’s GRAMMY Museum\, saw George’s famed Gibson ES-125TDC ‘Bad To The Bone’ guitar placed on permanent exhibit at The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\, performed at halftime for the Las Vegas Raiders\, were inducted into The Musicians Hall of Fame\, delivered the top-rated PBS Special Recorded Live At Analog\, and more. \nBut now it’s 2026. What could George Thorogood & The Destroyers possibly do for an encore? \n“Encore?” bellows George with a good-natured laugh. “We’re just getting started!” \nFor an artist whose music honors the blues\, rock and country legends of the past\, Thorogood’s forward momentum is now stronger than ever. And along with longtime Destroyers Jeff Simon (drums)\, Bill Blough (bass)\, Jim Suhler (guitar) and Buddy Leach (saxophone)\, they continue “to slap a custom flame paint job onto those classic sounds” (Blues Blast Magazine) like never before. “There’s never been a master plan\,” George says. “We’ll always be focused on playing music that makes all kinds of people happy. Because when the house lights go down\, the downbeat hits and the audience erupts\, there is no greater feeling in the world.”   \nFor the past 5+ decades\, over 8\,000 live shows and more than 15 million albums sold\, they’ve been called “The All-American rock & roll party band” (Goldmine Magazine)\, “one of the 5 best acts left out of The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame” (WNBF Binghamton) and “one of the most iconic bands in rock history” (Rapid City Journal). And for their 53rd year of “playing rock & roll hot enough to melt the polar icecaps and flood the world’s major population centers” (Rolling Stone)\, the 2026 continuation of The Baddest Show On Earth Tour is a stage-shaking\, roof-raising\, guitar-snarling blast for the band and fans alike. “We’ve always been a high wire act\,” says George. “The band and I now have a renewed taste for danger and an almost feral sense of purpose. Could be the state of the world. Maybe it’s the healing power of rock & roll. But when we hit the stage on any given night\, I can guarantee that we’ll make you feel like a teenager again.” \nGeorge Thorogood & The Destroyers have always delivered on their promises. In 1976\, they debuted as the most explosive indie breakthrough act of the decade. Throughout the ‘80s/’90s MTV era\, Thorogood was the epitome of snakeskin & shades guitar-slinger cool. And with chart-topping hits like ‘One Bourbon\, One Scotch\, One Beer’\, ‘Move It On Over’\, ‘Who Do You Love?’\, ‘I Drink Alone’\, ‘Get A Haircut’ and the ultimate badass anthem ‘Bad To The Bone’\, George & The Destroyers soon became undeniable cornerstones of Classic Rock. Meanwhile\, their album catalog – which now includes \nGeorge’s acclaimed 2017 solo disc Party Of One\, 2020’s epic George Thorogood & The Destroyers Live In Boston 1982: The Complete Concert\, and 2022’s The Original George Thorogood – continues to dominate streaming charts worldwide. As live performers\, they will always be untouchable: whether it’s been their legendary 50 States/50 Days Tour\, landmark performances at Live Aid and on SNL\, opening club dates for Muddy Waters or stadium shows for The Rolling Stones\, and recent smash tours with John Fogerty\, ZZ Top and Sammy Hagar\, one of rock’s premier showmen and his band remain among the most reliable/formidable concert acts on the planet. “Over the past three years alone\, we’ve played more than 200 shows in 20 countries throughout North America\, Europe and Australia\,” Thorogood says with pride. “Don’t let anyone tell you this gig won’t keep you energized. I defy bands half our age to put on a show like we do night after night.” \nOffstage\, George & The Destroyers also set a stellar example with their commitment to humanitarian causes that include a long-term relationship with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\, a current partnership with Musically Fed\, their annual ‘Who Do You Love’ holiday charity initiative now celebrating its 10th record-setting year\, and The Marla Thorogood Memorial Fund for Ovarian Cancer Research\, created in memory of George’s wife who passed away in 2019. . “My generation was raised on kindness and empathy\,” Thorogood explains. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a rock star or the milkman. If you’ve been blessed with a successful career\, you have an obligation to give back and help others. Wherever The Destroyers can spread love and make a difference\, count us in.” \nIf the true spirit of rock & roll can turn uncharted territory into a blow-out party\, then George Thorogood & The Destroyers are among rock’s great conquerors.  And in a career which has seen him recently receive such monumental tributes as The B.B. King Award from The Montreal International Jazz Festival\, being made honorary members of The Bo Diddley Centennial Committee by Bo’s daughter and grandson\, and being invited to perform at The Grand Ole Opry\, are there any milestones left for Thorogood to achieve in the next 50 years? “It’s crazy to think that we’ve spent the last half century performing music we love for audiences who love what we do\,” George says. “But when you’ve got the best job in the world\, you can’t ever rest on your laurels. Accolades are nice\, but connecting with people is what really matters. We not only work hard to bring our best\, but to keep getting better. That’s the only mission. That’s rock & roll.” \n

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents The Expendables with support from Chad Tepper
DESCRIPTION:March 20\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nThe Expendables have proven anything but in their nearly 25-year career since starting out as a spirited party band in high school performing surf-rock covers for birthdays and family gatherings. A quarter-century later\, elementary school buddies Raul Bianchi\, Adam Peterson and Geoff Weers\, along with bassist Ryan DeMars\, who joined in 2000\, have forged a unique sound born in the laid-back beach life in their hometown of Santa Cruz\, CA. The Expendables’ infectious hybrid of ska\, surf-rock\, punk\, reggae and metal can be heard in their latest streaming track\, “Surfman Cometh\,” a spaghetti-western meets “Pipeline” twang that could easily form the soundtrack to the latest Quentin Tarantino film. The song is the first release from the group’s new and improved Band Room\, their longtime rehearsal space in a 1\,100 square foot warehouse and former wine cellar on Coral Street\, where Adam Patterson took charge of the final mix to great effect. The band’s previous studio album of original material\, 2015’s Sand in the Sky\, was followed by The Expendables’ second release featuring acoustic reworkings of past material\, Gone Raw\, 2019’s follow-up to 2012’s Gone Soft. The Expendables continue woodshedding until they can get back out on the road. Their 2017 Moment EP\, which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Reggae chart\, showed the band starting to move into different musical directions\, a set featuring collaborations with reggae crooner HIRIE\, rapper Tech N9ne\, Eric Rachmany\, and Micah Peuschel.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents FOREIGNER: Live with an Orchestra
DESCRIPTION:March 21\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nWith 10 multi-platinum albums and 16 Top 30 hits\, FOREIGNER is universally hailed as one of the most popular rock acts in the world with a formidable musical arsenal that continues to propel sold-out tours and album sales\, now exceeding 80 million. \nResponsible for some of rock and roll’s most enduring anthems including “Juke Box Hero\,” “Cold As Ice\,” “Hot Blooded\,” “Waiting For A Girl Like You\,” “Feels Like The First Time\,” “Urgent\,” “Head Games\,” “Say You Will\,” “Dirty White Boy\,” “Long\, Long Way From Home” and the worldwide #1 hit\, “I Want To Know What Love Is\,” FOREIGNER still rocks the charts almost 50 years into the game with massive airplay and continued Billboard album chart success.  Audio and video streams of FOREIGNER’s hits exceed 15 million per week. \nWith more Top 10 songs than Journey and Aerosmith\, and as many as Fleetwood Mac\, FOREIGNER also features strongly in every category in Billboard’s “Greatest of All Time” listing.  At times\, the band’s weekly catalog sales have eclipsed those of Led Zeppelin\, AC/DC\, the Rolling Stones\, the Who\, Def Leppard\, Van Halen\, Aerosmith and most of their Classic Rock peers (Source: Nielsen SoundScan).  FOREIGNER‘s catalog sales were recently celebrated in Business Insider as hitting the Top 40 among the Best Selling Music Artists of All Time. \nFounded in 1976\, FOREIGNER‘s debut album produced the hits “Feels Like The First Time\,” “Cold As Ice” and “Long\, Long Way From Home.”  The album Double Vision followed\, as did a string of hits including “Urgent\,” “Juke Box Hero” and “Waiting For A Girl Like You.” Those songs helped give FOREIGNER‘s next album\, 4\, its impressive run at #1 on the Billboard chart. At the zenith of 80’s sound\, FOREIGNER‘s fifth album\, Agent Provocateur\, gave the world the incredible #1 global hit\,” I Want To Know What Love Is.” This musical milestone followed the record-breaking song “Waiting For A Girl Like You.” \n  \nFOREIGNER‘s founder is Songwriters Hall of Fame member Mick Jones. A visionary maestro whose stylistic songwriting\, indelible guitar hooks and multi-layered talents continue to escalate FOREIGNER‘s influence and guide the band to new horizons. \nJones reformed the band after a 2002 hiatus and selected lead singer Kelly Hansen to help write an inspired new chapter in the history of FOREIGNER. One of rock’s greatest showmen\, Hansen is among the most respected\, consummate professionals in rock and roll. With a 40-year career that spans almost every area of music\, from the role of lead vocalist to producing and engineering\, Hansen has led FOREIGNER into the digital age while inspiring a whole new generation of fans. \nFOREIGNER’s lineup also includes noted Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson\, Michael Bluestein on keyboards\, guitarist Bruce Watson\, Chris Frazier on drums and guitarist Luis Carlos Maldonado. An unprecedented new level of energy led the group to a re-emergence of astounding music that speaks to FOREIGNER‘s enduring popularity. \nWith renewed vitality and direction\, FOREIGNER hit the Billboard charts again with the 2005 release of their live Greatest Hits album\, Extended Versions. Can’t Slow Down followed in 2009 and entered the Billboard chart in the Top 30\, driven by two Top 20 radio singles\, “In Pieces” and “When It Comes To Love.”  To follow was the release of the band’s three-disc set\, Feels Like The First Time\, which included an acoustic CD with an intimate and unique re-interpretation of many FOREIGNER classics\, studio re-records by the new lineup and a live performance DVD showcasing the group’s exceptional live energy. \n  \nFOREIGNER’s music experienced another surge in popularity in recent years thanks to usage in primetime television\, major motion pictures\, video games\, advertising\, and digital content. Films such as Rock of Ages\, Bad Moms\, Angry Birds\, Magic Mike\, Pitch Perfect\, Good Boys\, The Eternals\, and Happy Gilmore 2\, and television shows Orange Is The New Black\, Stranger Things\, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\, Tacoma FD\, Wednesday\, and Euphoria have all strongly featured Foreigner’s songs. Advertisers including Toyota\, Google\, Molson\, and Ford have turned to FOREIGNER’s music to engage their fans. \nIn May 2014\, Atlantic Records Chairman Craig Kallman presented the band with RIAA gold and platinum digital awards for six FOREIGNER songs.  These awards signify 500\,000 and 1\,000\,000 downloads of FOREIGNER hits.  That is more individual awards than any other heritage rock band\, and an illustration of FOREIGNER’s resonance in the digital era. \nIn recent years\, FOREIGNER has headlined several Live Nation tours\, rocking across the country and the world with contemporaries and friends. In 2014\, FOREIGNER headlined The Soundtrack of Summer US amphitheater tour with Styx and Don Felder. A hits compilation album of the same name was released to coincide with the tour and immediately hit the Billboard Top 200 chart. In 2015\, FOREIGNER joined Kid Rock on his “Cheap Date: First Kiss Tour.” \nIn October 2016\, FOREIGNER hit a major milestone when the band performed for the very first time at New York’s iconic Carnegie Hall with a sold-out acoustic show. The concert highlighted the band’s ongoing relationship with the GRAMMY Museum’s initiative to promote music education in our nation’s schools.  It included an a cappella contest among New York high schools who competed for a $5\,000 prize donated by the band. \nThe year also brought the release of FOREIGNER‘s first ever live acoustic album In Concert: Unplugged\, recorded at a once-in-a-lifetime private concert hosted by Edsel B. Ford II at the Ford Motor Company Conference & Event Center in Detroit\, MI.  The band’s royalties were donated to JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and the album is available exclusively via Amazon. \nThe year 2017 marked the celebration of FOREIGNER‘s 40th anniversary.  The Warner Music Group released a double CD set “40\,” which includes 40 songs recorded between 1977 and 2017.  The album spent several weeks on the Billboard Top 200 chart and it features two tracks recorded especially for this release\, “Give My Life For Love” and a new version of “I Don’t Want To Live Without You.” The album spent nine weeks in the Billboard Top 200 chart.  The US anniversary headline tour played 40 shows across the United States where the band was supported by Cheap Trick and Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Experience. \nIn April 2018\, FOREIGNER topped the Billboard Classic Album Charts for the first time with FOREIGNER WITH THE 21ST CENTURY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA & CHORUS\, a live recording of FOREIGNER’s first-ever orchestral shows in Lucerne\, Switzerland. The band went on to headline orchestral shows in the US\, Europe\, Australia and New Zealand throughout the year including sold-out appearances at London’s Royal Albert Hall and the iconic Sydney Opera House. In the summer of 2018\, FOREIGNER starred in a thirty city Live Nation US summer tour with Whitesnake and Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Evening in support.  \nThe excitement continued in 2019 with the premiere of Juke Box Hero\, the Musical in Canada. Following a series of sold-out workshops in Alberta and Calgary\, the musical premiered in Toronto in February and a Broadway run is on the horizon. \nThe November 2019 release of Double Vision: Then & Now is a DVD/CD package that celebrates the 40th anniversary of the iconic album.  It features a stunning reunion concert that brings together the current and original band members playing all the hits at the top of their game. \n2020 kicked off with a three-day run at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra in mid-January.  Another highlight was a sold-out January/February residency at The Venetian\, Las Vegas.  The Covid-19 nightmare forced the band to postpone almost a hundred shows all over the world including a sold-out show with Whitesnake at the 18\,000 seat London 02 Arena.  \nThe Covid impact on the live concert business continued through much of 2021\, although by careful observation of health protocols\, Foreigner was able to execute a limited\, but highly successful touring schedule breaking box office records in many markets.  Following spectacular shows at LA’s Greek Theater and the Santa Barbara Bowl\, the band embarked on a run of theater and major casino dates and other special events.  These included appearances at Detroit’s Fox Theatre and the Hard Rock Live at Etess Arena in Atlantic City.  Another highlight was an appearance at the Annual Gala of the American Turkish Society\, which celebrated the life of Mick Jones’ and Foreigner’s guiding light at Atlantic Records\, Ahmet Ertegun. The year culminated with FOREIGNER’s appearance at the spectacular Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. \n2022 commenced with a three-week residency at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas and the rescheduled co-headline UK tour with Whitesnake\, and solo headline shows across Europe.  The year continued with an exciting schedule of headline appearances that included the New York State Fair\, where FOREIGNER’s 38\,888 plus audience broke the Classic Rock attendance record\, and a run of sold-out amphitheater shows with Kid Rock.  In the fall\, FOREIGNER returned to international touring with sold out shows in France\, Holland\, Israel\, and South Africa. \nIn 2023\, the band continued touring throughout the United States with a 32-date Live Nation amphitheater tour with special guest Loverboy.  That year also saw FOREIGNER’s third residency at the Venetian\, Las Vegas and major TV appearances on GMA and Fox & Friends. \nIn the spring of 2024\, FOREIGNER executed a sold-out tour of Canada and another Live Nation headline tour of amphitheaters with our partners STYX with attendances of 14\,000 to 15\,000 in some markets\, together with two headline residencies at the Las Vegas Venetian in the spring and fall.  The biggest news of the year was FOREIGNER’s nomination to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame followed by an appearance at the induction ceremony in Cleveland which was broadcast on national TV.  The band also announced a Hall of Fame celebration tour which began with the fall Las Vegas residency and continues through 2025.  The band released TURNING BACK THE TIME in the fall.  This is part of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame celebration and features FOREIGNER’s hits through the years with a newly released song written by Mick Jones and Lou Gramm and originally recorded in 1996. ‘I Want To Know What Love Is’ became one of a handful of Classic Rock artists’ songs to achieve 1 Billion streams on Spotify.  The band hit this landmark before any songs from The Who\, Pink Floyd or Bob Dylan. \n2025 saw the advent of a celebration for Foreigner’s Latin American fans. Luis Maldonado recorded some of the hits in Spanish\, most notably ‘Quiero Saber Si Es Amor’ with Mexican superstar Joy Huerta. Luis led the band on vocals through a spring tour of Mexico and South America which also featured special guest Lou Gramm.  In an epic and emotional season finale of The Voice\, Kelly Hansen announced his fall 2025 retirement and introduced Maldonado as his replacement. \nMore about FOREIGNER — including individual band member bios\, tour dates\, merchandise\, and more — can be found on the band’s official website\, www.foreigneronline.com. \nwww.foreigneronline.com \nwww.facebook.com/Foreigner \nwww.twitter.com/ForeignerMusic \nwww.instagram.com/foreignerlive \nwww.youtube.com/user/FWebTeam

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Johnny Marr with special guest His Lordship
DESCRIPTION:March 23\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nJohnny Marr started his career with The Smiths\, beginning an amazing history as one of the most influential songwriters and guitarists in British independent music. His subsequent creative journey has seen him at the heart of The The\, Electronic\, Modest Mouse and The Cribs\, as well as working with such names as The Pretenders\, Talking Heads\, The Avalanches\, and the musician and composer Hans Zimmer – with whom he recorded the score and soundtrack for the most recent James Bond film\, No Time To Die\, including the Oscar-nominated title track created with Billie Eilish. \nSince launching in 2013\, Marr’s solo career has given rise to four UK Top Ten studio albums – The Messenger (2013)\, Playland (2014)\, Call The Comet (2018)\, Fever Dreams Pts 1-4 (2022) and a career-spanning book\, Marr’s Guitars (via Thames & Hudson). \nThe full measure of this extraordinarily fertile creative period is captured on his latest offering\, Spirit Power: The Best Of Johnny Marr\, a major new collection curated by Johnny encompassing songs from his first ten years as a solo artist\, a scattering of stand alone singles and two incendiary new cuts\, Somewhere and The Answer.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Jeff Tweedy with special guest Sima Cunningham
DESCRIPTION:March 27\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 6:30pm/ Show 7:30pm\nAges: 12+ \nJeff Tweedy\, founding member and frontman of Wilco\, is one of contemporary music’s most respected songwriters and performers. In addition to 13 Wilco albums\, he has released five solo albums – most recently\, his 30-track “magnum opus” (New York Times) Twilight Override. This tour\, featuring his sons and longtime collaborators\, offers a rare chance to experience songs from across his expansive catalog and step inside the world of Twilight Override. \nTwilight Override Bio by Jeff TweedyWhen you align yourself with creativity and creation\, you align yourself with something that other people call God. And if you align yourself with creation\, you have automatically taken a side against destruction. You’re on the side of creation. And that does a lot to quell the impulse to destroy.Is the world getting darker? Sure feels like it. What is it? Is it the pervasive nagging toothache of dread that comes with witnessing the disintegration of a country that you thought you knew and understood? A home you still love with a love that could never be taken away\, regardless of how painful that love has become. That sense of decline is hard to ignore\, and it must at least be a part of the shroud I’m trying to uncover. The twilight of an empire seems like a good enough jumping-off point when one is jumping into the abyss. \nTwilight sure is a pretty word\, though. And the world is filled with former empires\, so maybe that’s not where this dissonance is coming from entirely. Could be how old I’ve managed to become without warning. My own personal Twilight. What ever it is out there (or in there) squeezing this ennui into my day\, it’s fucking overwhelming. It’s difficult to just ignore. Twilight Override is my effort to overwhelm it right back. Here are the songs and sounds and voices and guitars and words that are an effort to let go of some of the heaviness and up the wattage on my own light. My effort to engulf this encroaching nighttime (nightmare) of the soul.What I really want to do is grow my heart big enough to love everyone. And if I want a heart to grow big enough to meet this moment\, it requires something expansive. “Like a TRIPLE record!?”\, you ask? Yes! Like a goddamn triple record! I mean…What else do I have but my songs and my family and my friends? What else do any of us have to keep the lights on? How else can I generate my own light? To me any song\, no matter what the subject matter\, can be a point of light and that’s one of the reasons I try and make so many of them. They all have the potential\, even the heaviest music on the Earth has the potential\, to lift someone up. This sounds like a Hallmark card\, but it rocks harder than a Hallmark card. \nI’m aware the day ends and the sun sets no matter how hard we wish for it to lift itself back out of the ocean. So I guess what we’re really talking about is time. In a way these three records represent the past\, present and future. The darkness comes and goes. But the clock keeps plowing ahead. We all want more. But not more of this particular shitty time. It feels like the clock is camped out at the worst part of the day. Everyone stuck saying goodbye to the future they woke up to. Waiting for it to get dark enough to dream up a new day. \nTruthfully\, I’ve been doing this for a long time. And I’m not going anywhere. This is the stuff that works for me. I can’t sing and be afraid at the same time. And dreaming at twilight isn’t forbidden. Not quite a daydream and nowhere near a nightmare. Twilight dreaming is a lovely workaround. Killing time with key changes and harmonies. Feel free to join us all here. Not singing into the void or at the void. Just singing. Feeling good. Together. It will do you no harm. Sharing this music with the world is the best I can do.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Y&T
DESCRIPTION:April 3\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nBefore Mötley Crüe\, before RATT\, even before there was a Metallica\, Y&T was slogging away in sweaty rock clubs around America. When the band formed in the early 1970s\, little did they know they would set the standard for hard rock bands that trailed. Many of the biggest acts of the ’80s became popular opening for headliners Y&T—and cut their teeth on the band\, as evidenced by the Y&T mentions in tell-all books by acts such as Metallica and Mötley Crüe. \nBorn in Oakland\, California\, Y&T is one of the San Francisco Bay Area’s own innovators of the hard rock sound. Whether performing to a festival crowd of fifty-thousand or in an intimate nightclub\, Y&T’s high-energy set and passionate performances still captivate legions of fans around the globe\, proving Y&T’s music timeless. \nOriginally formed as Yesterday and Today\, the initial powerhouse quartet—featuring Dave Meniketti (lead guitar/lead vocals)\, Phil Kennemore (bass)\, Leonard Haze (drums)\, and Joey Alves (rhythm guitar)—tore through the ’70s and ’80s with their own brand of hard rock. After two ’70s albums on London Records\, they shortened their name to Y&T and released eight albums on A&M in the ’80s. Two more albums with Geffen Records marked an era of change with Jimmy DeGrasso (Alice Cooper\, Suicidal Tendencies\, Megadeth) on drums and Stef Burns (Alice Cooper\, Berlin\, Huey Lewis) on guitar. \nWith a discography of 18 albums\, three greatest hits collections\, plus a boxed set\, Y&T has sold over four million albums since their 1974 inception. The band’s most recent single I’m Coming Home has climbed to roughly 1.5 million views on YouTube. Y&T received extensive airplay with hits such as Forever\, Rescue Me\, Mean Streak\, Don’t Stop Runnin’\, and Summertime Girls—which played in heavy rotation on MTV. Y&T songs have been featured in a multitude of movies and television shows\, including Real Genius\, Out of Bounds\, Baywatch\, and Hunter. After five top 100 albums\, songs that tipped into the 40s\, two Bammie Awards\, and many international television appearances\, Y&T’s hits are still played on VH1 Classic and classic rock radio stations worldwide. \nWith the passing of Kennemore\, Haze\, and Alves\, it’s Meniketti who carries on the legacy that is Y&T. Y&T continues to tour the world\, featuring the dynamic original frontman Dave Meniketti (lead guitar/lead vocals)\, John Nymann (guitar/vocals)\, Aaron Leigh (bass/vocals)\, and Mike Vanderhule (drums/vocals)\, playing songs that span the band’s five-decade career and including all the hits and fan favorites. Prepare to have your face melted. \n

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Gary Numan with support from TREMOURS
DESCRIPTION:April 7\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nWith Support From: TREMOURS \nMay\, 1979. It’s an ordinary Thursday evening\, which means it’s time for Top of the Pops. Amidst a zeitgeist of punk and disco\, the show suddenly appears to be interrupted by a transmission from the future. A luminous synth riff echoes out\, a beat drives on and up steps an otherworldly figure – part robot\, part alien – to deliver an enigmatic lyric depicting some kind of android existence in a dystopian future. It’s Gary Numan fronting Tubeway Army for their breakthrough hit ‘Are ‘Friends’ Electric?’. \nOf the millions that are watching\, few would’ve recognised that this moment foreshadows the shape of music to come\, from synth-pop to industrial and alt-pop. That\, however\, can’t stop it igniting the imagination of an audience that would swell into a devoted following. \nFast-forward to January\, 2021. Numan’s first single ‘Intruder’ (from the Intruder album) pulsates ominously as if it’s soundtracking an imminent threat. As austere synths loom like shadows and industrial beats are detonated\, the beguiling hook towers like a beacon in the darkness. It’s visionary and venomous\, with a narrative that imagines the Earth growing angry at mankind’s actions\, and more than willing to fight back. In the accompanying video\, Numan looks even more out of time than he did back in 1979\, like an intergalactic refugee fighting for his own existence. \nThose two songs show how Numan has consistently fought against the grain to stick resolutely to his creative vision. In a career that spans over forty years\, the music evolves and the themes change. But fans remain fascinated by Numan for the very fact that he’s so uncompromising. \nAny story charting four decades will be a mixed blessing of momentous highs and meagre lows. The achievements are remarkable for someone who never made any concessions to mainstream success. Seven Top 10 singles\, including ‘Are ‘Friends’ Electric?’ and the debut solo hit ‘Cars’; eight Top 10 albums\, three of which topped the charts; and huge critical acclaim\, most notably with the Inspiration Award at the prestigious Ivor Novellos. \nNaturally\, there were times when Numan was very much not in vogue. Sure\, there would be ripples of rediscovery but there were years when his increasingly conceptual albums were primarily embraced by hardcore fans. He wasn’t troubling the charts\, but audiences were still flocking to see him perform – almost every UK tour would include a sold-out show at the 5000 capacity Hammersmith Apollo. \nGradually\, though\, praise from Nine Inch Nails\, Prince and David Bowie led to a reappraisal of his work. And that has been magnified in recent years with Kanye West\, Lady Gaga and Dave Grohl citing him as an influence. \nAnd so\, a new narrative emerged. An unlikely icon returned to the top while making music that was darker\, fiercer and more inventive than ever. \n‘Splinter (Songs From A Broken Mind)’ set the ball rolling by peaking at #20 in 2013\, its precise\, post-industrial sound delving into Numan’s experiences with depression. He started a new deal with BMG in 2017 and released ‘Savage (Songs From A Broken World)’\, an album which depicted earth as a barren wasteland in which humanity and culture had been largely crushed by the effects of global warming. ‘Savage’ hit #2 in the UK charts. \nHis next album\, ‘Intruder’\, presented a fresh but complementary narrative. It’s a philosophical examination of a potential future apocalypse: the planet can only survive by purging its inhabitants. ‘Intruder’ also hit #2 in the UK charts. \nNuman explained: “‘Intruder’ looks at climate change from the planet’s point of view. If the Earth could speak\, and feel things the way we do\, what would it say? How would it feel? The songs\, for the most part\, attempt to be that voice\, or at least try to express what I believe the earth must feel at the moment”. \nThe planet sees us as its children now grown into callous selfishness\, with a total disregard for its well being. It feels betrayed\, hurt and ravaged. Disillusioned and heartbroken it is now fighting back. Essentially\, it considers human kind to be a mistake\, a virus attacking the planet. Climate change is the undeniable sign of the Earth saying enough is enough\, and finally doing what it needs to do to get rid of us\, and explaining why it feels it has to do it.” \nPartially written and recorded during lockdown\, it’s no surprise that current circumstances have been assimilated into its themes. It’s especially evident in ‘The Gift’\, which evolves from a sparse introduction into a resonant Middle-Eastern sonic motif. It imagines Covid-19 as the first weapon that the planet deploys in order to eradicate mankind and once again flourish. \nWhile anger and vengeance rage in its opening chapters\, ‘Intruder’ charts a wider spectrum of emotions. ‘Is This World Not Enough’ and ‘A Black Sun’ exude regret and then despair that this fate could’ve been avoided. The finale presents a black-hearted double-bill to bring the curtain down on the tale. First ‘Now And Forever’ offers a hope of eternity in the end days during its theatrical intensity\, before the sparse\, sorrowful ‘The End Of Dragons’ ends on the chilling reminder that what’s broken can’t always be fixed. \nCollectively the album proves that Numan’s creative spark shows no sign of being extinguished. \nNuman toured the Intruder album at over 130 shows around the world\, finally ending in mid 2024 when he toured the US with Ministry. Since then he’s been back in the studio writing and recording his next (and 23rd) album\, due out in early 2026. This one looks at a near future world where humanity lives or dies based on the whims of an AI controlled system. He did take a few weeks out of the studio to play a major UK tour in the Fall to celebrate the 45th Anniversary of his ‘Replicas’ and ‘The Pleasure Principle’ albums\, both UK Number 1’s when first released. \nThat’s just a snapshot of the tale behind one of music’s most singular talents. The full story can be found in Numan’s critically acclaimed autobiography ‘(R)evolution’\, which The Observer described as an\, “exhaustive\, entertaining and often poignant life story.” What comes next will surely be just as intriguing.

He has received lifetime achievement awards for songwriting from the BBC Radio 2 Awards\, the Americana Music Association\, and was awarded the prestigious Ivor Novello Award.

SUMMARY:Going to Extremes: A John Waters 80th Birthday Celebration
DESCRIPTION:April 12\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nJohn Waters (Writer/Director)  \nBorn in Baltimore\, MD in 1946\, John Waters was drawn to movies at an early age\, particularly exploitation movies with lurid ad campaigns. He subscribed to Variety at the age of twelve\, absorbing the magazine’s factual information and its lexicon of insider lingo. This early education would prove useful as the future director began his career giving puppet shows for children’s birthday parties. As a teenager\, Waters began making 8-mm underground movies influenced by the likes of Jean-Luc Godard\, Walt Disney\, Andy Warhol\, Russ Meyer\, Ingmar Bergman\, and Herschell Gordon Lewis. \nUsing Baltimore\, which he fondly dubbed the “Hairdo Capitol of the World\,” as the setting for all his films\, Waters assembled a cast of ensemble players\, mostly native Baltimoreans\, and friends of long standing: Divine\, David Lochary\, Mary Vivian Pearce\, Mink Stole and Edith Massey. Waters also established lasting relationships with key production people\, such as production designer Vincent Peranio\, costume designer Van Smith\, and casting director Pat Moran\, helping to give his films that trademark Waters “look.” \nWaters made his first film\, an 8-mm short\, Hag in a Black Leather Jacket in 1964\, starring Mary Vivian Pearce. Waters followed with Roman Candles in 1967\, the first of his films to star Divine and Mink Stole. In 1968\, he made his first 16-mm film with Eat Your Makeup\, the story of a deranged governess and her lover who kidnap fashion models and force them to model themselves to death. Mondo Trasho\, Waters’ first feature length film\, was completed in 1969 despite the fact that the production ground to a halt when the director and two actors were arrested for “participating in a misdemeanor\, to wit: indecent exposure.” \nIn 1970\, Waters completed what he described as his first “celluloid atrocity\,” Multiple Maniacs. The film told the story of Lady Divine and her lover\, Mr. David\, proprietors of a freak show who lure unsuspecting suburbanites into their tents to witness “The Cavalcade of Perversions.”  \nIn 1972 Waters created what would become the most “notorious” film in the American independent cinema of the 1970’s\, Pink Flamingos. Centered on the great battle to secure the title “Filthiest People Alive\,” Pink Flamingos pitted Divine’s Babs Johnson against Mink Stole and David Lochary’s truly evil Connie and Raymond Marble\, while turning Waters into a cult celebrity. Pink Flamingos went on to become a smash success at midnight screenings in the U.S. and all over the world. Pink Flamingos\, called “a paragon of bad taste” by the Museum of Modern Art\, was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress\, one of only 25 films earmarked in 2021 year for preservation “as works of enduring importance to American culture.”  \nWaters followed the success of Pink Flamingos with three more pictures\, spanning the remainder of the decade. In 1974 he created Female Trouble\, the story of Dawn Davenport (Divine)\, a criminal who wanted to be famous so badly she committed murder. 1977 marked the premier of Desperate Living\, a monstrous fairytale comedy starring the notorious Mafia moll turned stripper Liz Renay. In 1981 Waters completed Polyester\, a wide-screen comic melodrama starring Divine and Tab Hunter. Filmed in glorious “Odorama\,” ticket buyers were given scratch ‘n’ sniff cards that allowed the audience to smell along with the characters in their fragrant search for romantic happiness. \nIn Hairspray (1988)\, Waters created “an almost big-budget comedy extravaganza about star-struck teen-age celebrities in 1962\, their stage mothers and their quest for mental health.” The film was a box office and critical success and starred the then unknown Ricki Lake\, Deborah Harry\, Sonny Bono\, Jerry Stiller\, Pia Zadora\, and Ric Ocasek. The U.S. Library of Congress added Hairspray to the National Film Registry in 2022\, Librarian of Congress calling it …”an irresistible look at Baltimore’s teen dance scene in 1962\, as well as a moving plea for racial integration.” \nThe success of Hairspray brought Waters major Hollywood backing for his next feature\, Cry-Baby (1990)\, a juvenile delinquent musical comedy satire\, starring Johnny Depp. In 1994\, Waters released Serial Mom\, the well-reviewed\, socially un-redeeming comedy starring Kathleen Turner and Sam Waterston\, which was the closing night attraction at that year’s Cannes Film Festival. \nPecker\, a feel-good movie about lesbian strippers\, pubic-hair harassment\, and amateur photography\, was released in 1998.  It starred Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. The Japan Times called it “a Disney film for perverts.” \nCecil B. DeMented\, a comedy action-thriller about a young lunatic film director (Stephen Dorff) and his gang of film cultists who kidnap a real-life Hollywood movie goddess (Melanie Griffith) and force her to act in their own Super 8 underground movie\, was released in 2000. Kevin Thomas of The LA Times\, called Cecil B. DeMented “a fast\, furious and funny fusillade of a movie.” \nA Dirty Shame concerns head-injury sufferers who\, after their concussion\, experience a carnal lust they cannot control.  It stars Tracey Ullman\, Johnny Knoxville\, Selma Blair\, and Chris Isaak. Rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America\, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film “wicked\, kinky fun.” \nSeptember 2023 the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures opened John Waters: Pope of Trash\, the first comprehensive exhibition dedicated to John Waters’ contributions to cinema. The accompanying exhibition catalog was edited with text by Jenny He and Dara Jaffe and published by DelMonico Books/Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. That same month he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \n~~ \nIn addition to writing and directing feature films\, Waters is the author of ten books\, including Shock Value\, Crackpot\, Pink Flamingos and Other Filth\, Hairspray\, Female Trouble and Multiple Maniacs\, and Art: A Sex Book (co-written with art critic Bruce Hainley). In 2025 the screenplay books are reissued in individual editions from Picador. His book Role Models was published by Farrar\, Straus and Giroux in 2010 and earned spots on the best seller lists for the New York Times\, Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle. Carsick\, John Waters’ book chronicling his preparations and adventure hitchhiking from Baltimore to San Francisco in the Spring of 2012\, was published by Farrar\, Straus and Giroux in 2014 and debuted on the NY Times Bestseller list at #12 and on the Los Angeles Times Bestseller list in the #7 position. The Grammy nominated audiobook version of Carsick\, as read by John Waters\, was a featured pick by AudioFile Magazine\, Publisher’s Weekly and the L.A. Times Summer Reading list\, among others.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents Sierra Hull with support from Mason Via
DESCRIPTION:APRIL 18\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nSierra Hull is a seven-time IBMA Mandolin Player of the Year and six-time Grammy nominee\, one of bluegrass and Americana’s most dynamic voices. Her latest album\, A Tip Toe High Wire\, her first independent release\, highlights her songwriting and instrumental mastery\, featuring Béla Fleck\, Tim O’Brien\, and Aoife O’Donovan. The album is nominated for four GRAMMY Awards\, balancing tradition with innovation. \nHull has shared stages with Alison Krauss\, Eric Clapton\, Sturgill Simpson\, Slash\, and Robert Randolph\, and performed on NPR’s Tiny Desk and The Kelly Clarkson Show. She is the first female artist with a Gibson signature mandolin and a Tennessee Governor’s Distinguished Arts Award recipient. \nWith support from Mason Via \nMason Via’s new single\, “Wide Open.” Co-written by Mason Via and Zach John King \, this track paints vivid pictures of campfires\, screen doors\, and sunsets over pastures\, while also capturing the essence of young heartbreak. Raised in Patrick Springs\, VA\, Mason drew on his childhood experiences growing up in the hills\, hollers\, and backwoods of southern Virginia to inspire this incredible new song. Via says\, “The song chronicles the singer’s emotional state as he reaches back into his memory to recall how much he loved the girl who has left him\, and how much her absence has cut him to the core.” This song evokes a similiar emotion that Mason conveyed in Daughter of the Highlands (his stand out vocal on the Grammy nominated album Jubilee.) The track features Mason Via on lead vocals and guitar; Aaron Ramsey on mandolin; Jason Davis on banjo; Jim Vancleve on fiddle; Jeff Partin on bass and resophonic guitar; Kyser George on second guitar; Brooks Forsyth on harmony vocals; and Nick Goad on harmony vocals. This track sounds like Old Crow Medicine Show\, Tyler Childers \, Zach Bryan\, Flatland Cavalry\, Turnpike Troubadours\, and Mountain Heart.

SUMMARY:An Evening with MATISYAHU
DESCRIPTION:April 20\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a spirit that hovers above the waters. It has been here since the beginning of creation\, yet it is just being born. Ancient Child is Matisyahu’s 8th full length studio album. In Jewish mysticism\, eight is the number beyond the natural cycle of the physical world.  As Matisyahu brings forth his eighth studio album\, the Ancient Child simultaneously reaches back in time and towards the future\, in search of the infinite divine light of redemption. Here\, Matisyahu finds himself reconnected with his Jewish identity and spirituality in a world post October 7th. \nIn a climate that has become obsessed with being “right” and defending its ego at all costs\, the Ancient Child investigates questions about history\, identity and destiny from the humility of a child through the wisdom of the of generations’ past. While Matisyahu had shifted his focus over the last decade to his personal life from his religion\, Ancient Child is a strong return to his love for Judaism and the deep existential quest to find universal meaning in the darkness.So what does Matisyahu come up with? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the world turns to darkness\, humanity has a choice – hide in a corner or meet at the crossroads and find a way to come together. As Matisyahu sings in “Find A Way” \nI’m at the crossroads if you wanna partake \nBut make no mistake \nIf you participate \nThere’s no one you can escape \nPontificate upon it \nAnd get caught in a maze \nOf confuse-ment… \n…I’ll Find a Way \nIt’s hard work\, but when we unite\, the entire world is forever changed for the better.  From here the Ancient Child is born. From here the humility of the child and the wisdom of the elders offer a glimpse at a redemptive future. The music on this album is not reggae. It’s not rock. It’s not hip hop. Yet it will be called all these things. Like Matisyahu\, and the world he tries to create lyrically\, it is a melding of various styles and sounds that have been influential from a universe of music the singer has absorbed through more than twenty years as a recording and touring Artist. \nAs a true artist\, Matisyahu is not concerned with reproducing the sounds of a specific genre but only interested in what moves the emotion and prepares the runway for his concepts to be cleared for landing. He writes from his experiences about hopes\, challenges and fears. Authenticity is always at the core.   \nIn a reference the album’s title\, Matisyahu presents a meditation on Jewish history\, his own role as a father\, and his yearning for a better future\, where the metaphorical sun/son comes up to move beyond the limitations. \nNorth\, South\, East\, West \nFour sons\,  \nI’m the dial of the compass \nJewel of the Nile  \nFour directions yes\, we conquest \nBorn for the come up \nNow we turn up \nLearn up \nSo you don’t get burnt up \nCome along  \nFollow my song \nMoshe’s from the water \nDrawn from the river \nSaved by daughter \nBut I never been a sinner \nGuess who’s coming \nGuess who’s coming to dinner \nGot a spliff desert  \nWear’n sandals in the winter \nPull the trigger  \nHow you figure \nI’m a winner \nWith a sound that from the inner \nThat’s my storage in the winter. \nSon Come Up.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellars Presents KT Tunstall with support from TOMI
DESCRIPTION:April 26\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nKT Tunstall has always lived in pursuit of creative evolution. The Grammy-nominated\, Brit Award-winning Scottish artist made an indelible mark on the music world with her 2004 multi-platinum debut Eye to the Telescope\, immediately establishing herself as a formidable force. \nNearly two decades on\, Tunstall’s career has spanned an eclectic array of genres – from introspective folk to blistering rock and experimental electro-pop – while she has remained one of the most iconic live performers of her generation\, renowned for her extraordinary voice that shifts effortlessly from soulful to bluesy grit to delicate folk-pop. Her music embodies a balance of raw emotion and visceral energy\, always remaining in constant service to memorable melody\, while her live shows are punctuated by a warm and often hilarious rapport with her audience. \nTunstall’s breakthrough came in 2004 on the revered UK music show Later… with Jools Holland. A last-minute addition to the lineup after rapper Nas dropped out\, Tunstall took to the stage armed with just her guitar\, a loop pedal\, and a tambourine on the floor. “Do that new ‘Woo Hoo’ one\,” her Label Boss suggested. So she did – and the rest\, as they say\, is history. Her stripped-back yet electrifying performance of “Black Horse and the Cherry Tree” captivated audiences instantly\, propelling her to global fame. In a pre-loop-pedal revolution era\, long before artists like Ed Sheeran popularized its use\, Tunstall stood out as a trailblazer and true pioneer of its use\, making the ‘one-woman-band’ setup not just novel but essential. \n“That night made me understand something important\,” Tunstall recalls. “It’s not just about the song\, it’s how you execute it under pressure\, how you share it. I didn’t realise how much people would love seeing how I did it. I think people got a kick out of seeing someone do something risky live\, and pull it off.” \nHer debut album\, Eye to the Telescope\, solidified her as a leading voice in the burgeoning folk-pop movement. Her debut record produced enduring hits such as the rhythmically charged “Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\,” the tender ballad “Other Side of the World\,” and the soaring anthem “Suddenly I See\,” which would later become synonymous with The Devil Wears Prada. She recalls her Manager at the time saying to her\, “enjoy this moment; they’ve used your entire unedited song for the beginning of the film\, no dialogue. It’ll probably never happen like this again”. The iconic opening scene of the movie cemented her place in a defining cultural moment. \nAmid a crowded field of rising female singer-songwriters\, Tunstall stood apart\, exuding authenticity and displaying an unmistakable stage presence and musicianship. “There are two core elements to my style\,” she reflects. “I’ve got the troubadour\, acoustic\, emotionally driven side\, and then there’s the raw\, fiery rock element with a ton of teeth.” This duality – switching from heartfelt acoustic ballads to gritty rock anthems – has been a hallmark of her career. \nBy the time her sophomore album Drastic Fantastic was released in 2007\, Tunstall had evolved from folk-pop ingénue to bona fide rock star. The record leaned further into guitar-driven rock without losing the melodic hooks that defined her sound. It reflected her resistance to being confined to one musical identity\, pushing beyond her folk roots. This was further explored in her 2010 album Tiger Suit\, recorded in Berlin\, where she fused acoustic instrumentation with pulsing electronic beats\, breaking new creative ground. \nInvisible Empire // Crescent Moon (2013) marked a dramatic shift in her sound and mood. Recorded in the widescreen desert landscapes of Tucson\, Arizona\, the album embraced a stripped-back\, Americana-tinged aesthetic\, mirroring a period of personal upheaval\, including the loss of her father and the breakdown of her marriage. Critically lauded\, the album revealed some of Tunstall’s most intimate and vulnerable work. \nAs she entered the second decade of her career\, Tunstall embarked on one of her most ambitious ventures yet: a trilogy of albums exploring the interwoven themes of soul\, body\, and mind. The first\, 2016’s KIN\, was the ‘soul’ record – a bright\, anthemic return that rekindled her love of music after a period of disillusionment. \nIn 2018\, she followed with WAX\, the ‘body’ record\, which embraced her rock instincts with a visceral intensity. The trilogy concluded in 2022 with NUT\, the ‘mind’ album\, written during a period of profound life changes\, including her move to the U.S.\, as well as creating an album remotely through the pandemic. “This trilogy represents probably the most extreme and transformative period of my life\,” Tunstall reflects. \nEarlier this year\, as the 20th anniversary of Eye to the Telescope approached\, Tunstall was honored with the prestigious Ivor Novello Award for ‘Outstanding Song Collection’ – a testament to her enduring influence among both peers and fans alike. In the past year\, she has toured both as a solo act and co-headliner with iconic U.S. singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin\, while also serving as a special guest on tours with Roger Daltrey\, and fellow Scots\, Texas. \nIn addition to her prolific music career\, Tunstall has expanded into composing for film and theater. Most recently\, it was announced that Clueless\, The Musical\, for which she composed the music\, will make its West End debut in February 2025. \nNext year\, Tunstall will celebrate the 20th anniversary of her seminal debut album Eye to the Telescope with a series of special performances and a re-release featuring additional tracks\, including an inaugural headline show at London’s Royal Albert Hall. After two decades\, KT Tunstall remains a vital\, ever-evolving artist – one who continues to surprise\, innovate\, and captivate audiences around the world. \nTOMI \nSometimes we have to leave everything behind in order to evolve. \nSongwriter/Producer Pam Autuori\, who performs as TOMI (she/her)\, found herself on that journey a few years ago. \nOn her upcoming album “Break It Til You Fix It” — produced by Autuori — she experiments with her dynamic vocal range and pushes the boundaries on self reflection and impulsivity. \nLearning towards her Americana roots\, the lyrics are thoughtful and blend effortlessly with the production\, making the listening experience a visual sonic landscape. \nTOMI’s style is characterized by ferocious guitar and resounding vocals — an unfettered\, urgent\, and emotionally supercharged sound that was forged from a ruthless determination to sing\, play\, and do things her own way\, even in the face of life’s obstacles. \nHer new album “Break it Til You Fix it” comes out March 10\, 2026. \nCheck out her latest single Let Me Down about chasing someone you can’t catch.

SUMMARY:JaM Cellar Presents Eric Johnson
DESCRIPTION:May 13\, 2026\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE  \nDoors 7pm/ Show 8pm\nAges: 12+ \nOne of the most outstanding instrumentalists in rock over the past 40 years\, Texas guitarist Eric Johnson was already a legend before he recorded his first album. By the early 1980s\, many celebrated guitarists were singing the praises of this skinny kid from Austin with the mind-melting chops. Comparisons were made to such guitar heroes as Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix and when he joined the ‘70s Austin fusion band Electromagnets they were being hailed as “the Mahavishnu Orchestra of Texas”. \nWith the release of his highly-anticipated 1986 solo debut album Tones\, the underground guitar legend finally emerged onto the scene fully-formed. It landed him on the cover of Guitar Player magazine\, which hailed the album as a “majestic debut”\, and earned him his first Grammy nomination for the song “Zap”. With the release of his follow up album\, 1990’s platinum-selling Ah Via Musicom\, which contained the Grammy Award winning song “Cliffs of Dover”\, Eric Johnson became a bona fide international guitar phenomenon. \nThe New Age Music Guide once opined that “Eric Johnson plays guitar the way Michelangelo painted ceilings: with a colorful vibrancy that’s more real than life” while Rolling Stone included him in their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of the 21st century. A dynamic singer as well as an incredibly gifted guitarist\, a pianist and a prolific songwriter\, Eric has been featured on the cover of countless guitar magazines around the world while also racking up critical accolades along the way. \nSince 1986 Eric has released seventeen albums\, in addition to albums with other artists such as Eclectic with jazz guitarist Mike Stern\, and the platinum-selling G3 Live with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Eric has received eight Grammy nominations along with numerous other recognitions\, awards and wins in various polls and magazines. \nAmong Johnson’s many accolades are a GRAMMY award in 1992 for “Cliffs of Dover” as Best Rock Instrumental Performance\, lifetime induction into the Guitar Player Gallery of Greats\, and his listing among the “100 Greatest Guitarists of the 20th Century” by Musician magazine. In his hometown of Austin Texas\, a city full of guitarists\, the readers of the Austin Chronicle voted Eric Johnson the city’s “Best Electric Guitarist” and “Best Acoustic Guitarist” in their yearly poll year after year. They also named him “Electric Guitarist of the Decade” and one of the top five “Musicians of the Decade”. In February 2024 Eric was honored with induction into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Association Hall of Fame. \n2023 found Eric on his ‘Treasure Tour’\, 67 US dates that were split between a Spring and a Fall tour. In January and February 2024 Eric joined the ‘G3 Reunion Tour’ with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai\, and the resulting new live album from the tour will be released in January 2025. In August 2024 he heads out for a run of dates in the north and northeast including the Backroads Blues Festival in New York. In September and October 2024 Eric was a featured performer on the ‘Experience Hendrix 2024 Tour’\, crossing the country from Washington state to Florida\, and then rejoined in March and April 2025 for the ‘Experience Hendrix 2025 Tour’ throughout the east and northeast USA and Canada. \nOver the course of more than four decades\, Eric Johnson has been traveling on a prolific odyssey. Along the way\, his creations have cross-pollinated the various musical genres which include rock\, blues\, jazz\, fusion\, soul\, folk\, new-age\, classical\, and even country. Inevitably EJ says it best himself in sharing that regardless of the genre “It really boils down to the music and the song at the end of the day”\, he explains. “The most important thing for me is to grow musically and make a more expansive and meaningful artistic statement with every new project”.
