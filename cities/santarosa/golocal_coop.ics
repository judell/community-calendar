SUMMARY:Sugarloaf Great Backyard Bird Count!
DESCRIPTION:Join Sugarloaf birders and other participants from more than 200 countries in the Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC)! Last year\, more than 800\,000 people helped identify more than 8\,000 bird species. We will start with an introduction to the eBird app\, which we will use to submit our group checklist. Then we will start birding as we hike ~1.5 mile hike (with ~300’ ascent) looking and listening for birds. We will also talk about using the Merlin app to help identify birds by sound or by photo. At the end\, we will submit our bird checklist via eBird. If you are on eBird\, we will share it with you so that it shows up on your account as well. If you are interested in using the Merlin app\, we highly recommend you install it on your phone along with the bird pack for US: West Coast before you arrive for the hike\, as cell service is very spotty or non-existent within the park. During the four days of the GBBC (February 13-16)\, you can see the map light up with checklists being submitted in real time across the world. \nMeet at the White Barn parking lot. There is a reservation fee of $10 per adult\, which will be refunded that day on site\, unless you choose to donate it. Children under 18 attend for free but must be registered and accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Wear layers (it is likely to be very cold up here)\, appropriate footwear for muddy/slippery trails\, sun protection\, bring at least a quart of water\, binoculars\, and if desired\, a snack\, a camera\, and/or a bird identification guide. We also invite you to bring a reusable drink container so your little ones can enjoy hot cocoa after the walk\, if desired. Heavy rains cancel. Parking fees apply.

SUMMARY:Documentary Screening - "Running for the Mountains"
DESCRIPTION:Documentary Screening – “Running for the Mountains” with important panel discussion.\nPanel members:\nCo producers/ Directors Julie Eisenberg and Babette Hogan\nJanelle Kellman\, former Sausalito Mayor\, now candidate for Lieutenant Governor of California in the 2026 elections.\nModerator – local KSVY radio host and Program Director Ronny Jo Grooms who is an experienced interviewer and story researcher.\nPaul Corbit Brown\, an activist featured in the documentary in West Virginia. \nSpecial Appalachian music from local front porch players to open the show \nRunning for the Mountains\, uncovers a story of dirty money and dirty politics – one that affects the entire nation. \nin 2008\, filmmakers Babette Hogan and Julie Eisenberg began following West Virginia native son and electoral activist Jesse Johnson. In his wake\, they discovered a deep story of good people and dark money\, devastation and defiance\, history and hope. More than a decade later\, with America divided\, the climate in crisis\, and the fossil fuel industry earning record profits\, the story of Appalachia offers a dire warning for the nation – and a way forward. \nFrom 2008-20024\, the filmmakers documented the rise of then Governor Joe Manchin and other pro-extraction WV politicians\, detailing financial conflicts of interest and cozy relationships with local media\, law enforcement\, and energy companies. Under their control\, West Virginia was\, and remains\, a fossil fuel fiefdom. The political film with an environmental backdrop shows how the West Virginia playbook impacts the rest of the country.

SUMMARY:Jay Lewellen at the Penngrove Pub
DESCRIPTION:BIO:\nSpending his high school and procrastinated college years in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina\, bluegrass and mountain music found its way into Jay’s heart. Country rock was not only in the air\, it was the air. In the 1970’s there was plenty of blues rock everywhere that was like a bedrock foundation. \nAfter college\, Jay headed for San Francisco. Could there be a more radical cultural shift than the Blue Ridge mountains to San Francisco? Probably not in this country! Diving into the music scene of the Grateful Dead and California music festivals of all sorts\, his musical perspective was pretty much fully formed\, adding some touches of jazz and swing music in there somewhere.
