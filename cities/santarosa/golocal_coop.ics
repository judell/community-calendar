SUMMARY:David Luning at Cloverdale Arts Alliance
DESCRIPTION:AMERICANA NIGHT WITH DAVID LUNING \nDavid Luning returns to Americana Night at the Cloverdale Arts Alliance Gallery on February 19 & 20. \nA Sonoma County staple with a voice that carries both grit and restraint\, Luning writes songs in the lineage of John Prine and Townes Van Zandt — plainspoken on the surface\, quietly devastating underneath. His catalog moves easily between folk\, blues\, and country\, driven by sharp guitar work and a delivery that never overreaches. It’s why his sets feel as convincing in an intimate gallery as they do on festival stages like Hardly Strictly Bluegrass\, and why Luning isn’t just any performer — he’s part of the soundtrack of Cloverdale.

SUMMARY:The Sam Chase & Willy Tea Taylor at Hopmonk Sebastopol
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT: \nTHE SAM CHASE: \nThe Sam Chase is a natural storyteller with a voice that sounds as if it has weathered many an epic tale. With boot stomping orchestration and lyrics that have been immortalized on the tattooed skin of their fans\, The Sam Chase & his band\, The Untraditional\, don’t mess around. \nWILLY TEA TAYLOR: \nThere is no question that Willy Tea Taylor’s life as a singer/songwriter was predetermined – his role realized the moment he wrote his first song. His inspirations drawn from two separate wells; Living the life of a cattleman’s kid and experiencing true visionaries music like Greg Brown\, John Hartford\, and Guy Clark. The image of Guy Clark and friends sitting around the kitchen table loaded with ashtrays full of butts\, half-smoked cigarettes\, food\, and booze on one Christmas Eve in 1975 burned into Taylors’s soul. Those guys\, swapping songs without pretense\, lit Willy Tea’s fire. And ever since\, its led purpose with passion – finding a hang by curating relationships through musical friendships that get him closer to his own Clark style kitchen table. \nFrom his early days co-fronting The Good Luck Thrift Store Outfit\, to singing solo in countless cowboy bars\, to pitching countless wiffle ball games\, Willy Tea has never lost the vision. Now Willy Tea Taylor has taken his vision of the “hero hang” on the road. and his talented traveling band The Fellership is made up of his fantastically talented buds who play Willy’s songs with a brand of reckless abandon and utter humility that spits in the face of pretense. The way The Fellership plays Will’s songs is the way they demand to be played and\, in their short time together\, they have been awe-ing every audience lucky enough to see them.

SUMMARY:David Luning at Cloverdale Arts Alliance
DESCRIPTION:AMERICANA NIGHT WITH DAVID LUNING \nDavid Luning returns to Americana Night at the Cloverdale Arts Alliance Gallery on February 19 & 20. \nA Sonoma County staple with a voice that carries both grit and restraint\, Luning writes songs in the lineage of John Prine and Townes Van Zandt — plainspoken on the surface\, quietly devastating underneath. His catalog moves easily between folk\, blues\, and country\, driven by sharp guitar work and a delivery that never overreaches. It’s why his sets feel as convincing in an intimate gallery as they do on festival stages like Hardly Strictly Bluegrass\, and why Luning isn’t just any performer — he’s part of the soundtrack of Cloverdale.
