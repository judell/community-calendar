SUMMARY:David Luning at Cloverdale Arts Alliance
DESCRIPTION:AMERICANA NIGHT WITH DAVID LUNING \nDavid Luning returns to Americana Night at the Cloverdale Arts Alliance Gallery on February 19 & 20. \nA Sonoma County staple with a voice that carries both grit and restraint\, Luning writes songs in the lineage of John Prine and Townes Van Zandt — plainspoken on the surface\, quietly devastating underneath. His catalog moves easily between folk\, blues\, and country\, driven by sharp guitar work and a delivery that never overreaches. It’s why his sets feel as convincing in an intimate gallery as they do on festival stages like Hardly Strictly Bluegrass\, and why Luning isn’t just any performer — he’s part of the soundtrack of Cloverdale.
