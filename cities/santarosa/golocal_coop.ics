SUMMARY:Ottmar Liebert & Luna Negra at the Mystic Theatre
DESCRIPTION:Ottmar Liebert & Luna Negra have been captivating audiences around the world for over three decades with their signature blend of flamenco\, classical guitar\, and global rhythms.

The group weaves together flamenco traditions with jazz\, Latin\, and world-music influences\, creating a rich\, flowing experience that transcends language and genre. With multiple Grammy nominations\, millions of albums sold\, and a devoted global following\, Ottmar Liebert & Luna Negra continue to redefine instrumental music—offering audiences an evening that is as soulful and meditative as it is passionate and powerful.

SUMMARY:Mark Hummel’s Blues Harmonica Blowout
DESCRIPTION:Mark Hummel’s 35th Annual Blues Harmonica Blowout with Mark Hummel\, Magic Dick\, Steve Freund\, Anson Funderburgh\, Rodrigo Mantovani\, RJ Mischo\, Curtis Salgado\, and drummer Wes Starr. \nMark Hummel’s Blues Harmonica Blowout™ started on a Sunday night in 1991 at Ashkenaz in Berkeley with four harmonica players: Rick Estrin\, Mark\, Dave Earl and Doug Jay. Each player performed a twenty-to-thirty minute set\, and everyone jammed together with Hummel’s Blues Survivors as backup. Over the next five years\, it grew to become a multi venue event around California and included bigger names like William Clarke\, Norton Buffalo\, and Paul DeLay. By the year 2000 the Blowout was headlining Yoshi’s in Oakland as a four-night show with Rod Piazza\, Kim Wilson\, Rick Estrin\, James Harman and Billy Branch. These shows were recorded for Mountain Top Records. \nSince then\, the Blues Harmonica Blowout has become a who’s who of older and younger players\, black\, white\, male and female\, national\, and international. From icons like Snooky Pryor\, Carey Bell\, James Cotton\, Charlie Musselwhite\, John Mayall\, John Hammond\, Little Sonny\, Lazy Lester\, Billy Boy Arnold\, Sam Myers\, Corky Siegel\, Magic Dick\, Huey Lewis\, Lee Oscar\, Jerry Portnoy\, Howard Levy and Paul Oscher to younger players like Sugar Ray Norcia\, Jason Ricci\, Son Of Dave\, Aki Kumar\, Curtis Salgado\, Kenny Neal\, RJ Mischo\, Sugar Blue\, Annie Raines\, Carlos Del Junco\, just to name a few. \nThe selection of guitarists has also been a stunner including Duke Robillard\, Rusty Zinn\, Bob Welsh\, Little Charlie Baty\, Anson Funderburgh\, Jr. Watson\, Billy Flynn\, Steve Freund\, Mike Keller\, and many more.

SUMMARY:The Sam Grisman Project at the Mystic Theatre
DESCRIPTION:Sam Grisman is a bass player\, music appreciator\, and bandleader who grew up in Mill Valley\, California in a home where some of the great acoustic music of our time was being recorded on a regular basis. His father\, legendary mandolinist\, composer\, and producer\, David Grisman\, was constantly having friends come over to his home studio for recording sessions and rehearsals. These friends\, such as Doc Watson\, Jerry Garcia\, John Hartford\, Mike Seeger\, and Tony Rice all left an impression on the younger Grisman and inspired him to pursue a life making music with his many talented friends. \nSam Grisman Project was created to shed light on the music that Sam grew up around\, and highlight that music’s influence on the members of the collective and in the greater music community. The band’s shows create a safe space where the band and audience can bask in the shared love and reverence for the great music and musicians who continue to inspire us all. \nThe friends who make up Sam Grisman Project are a rotating cadre of acousticians who are some of the brightest individual voices on their respective instruments. Members of this rotating cast of instrumental wizards include guitarists Max Flansburg\, Logan Ledger\, Sam Leslie\, Henry Moser\, Jesse Harper\, and Jefferson Hamer\, mandolinists Dominick Leslie\, Joe K. Walsh\, Matt Flinner\, and Jesse Appelman\, clawhammer banjo maestro Victor Furtado\, fiddlers John Mailander\, Alex Hargreaves\, Nate Leath\, Shad Cobb\, and Phoebe Hunt\, cellist Nat Smith\, and Todd Livingston on the Dobro. \nThe band also frequently collaborates with legendary singer\, songwriter\, and bluegrass pioneer Peter Rowan\, a deeply meaningful connection for Sam and the band tying directly back to his father David Grisman and the Old and In the Way legacy. Over the years Sam Grisman Project has been joined by a wide range of spontaneous and exciting guests including David Grisman\, John Sebastian\, Tim O’Brien\, Billy Strings\, Maria Muldaur\, Margo Price\, and many more. \nThis ever evolving collective of exceptional humans who happen to be incredible musicians is a testament to the abundance of joy\, and wealth of experiences that growing up around this timeless music has brought into the younger Grisman’s life. Sam Grisman Project is committed to putting their love\, gratitude\, and individuality into the music that they share on stage each night\, and to participating in the community effort of preserving\, expanding\, and appreciating great American acoustic music. \nTo preserve the sonic integrity of their instruments and voices\, SGP plays acoustic music into condenser microphones. The sound on stage is fully acoustic and sensitive\, so we kindly ask that you save conversations for before and after the show or during the set break. Thanks for coming and thanks for listening. We hope you enjoy the music. \n“They don’t just play this music. They live it. And they make you feel like you’re part of it too.” — No Depression \n“This isn’t nostalgia. It’s a living breathing celebration led by musicians who understand the soul of the music.” — Bluegrass Today \n“One of the most joyful and reverent tributes to the Grateful Dawg legacy you’ll ever witness.” — Relix Magazine

SUMMARY:Ambrosia at the Mystic Theatre
DESCRIPTION:Ambrosia\, the band known and loved by a multitude of fans since the 1970’s\, is now more alive and compelling than ever. This 5-time Grammy Nominated ensemble is exploring new musical territory and bringing an exceptional musical performance to stages everywhere. \nIn 1970\, four young musicians from the South Bay of Los Angeles\, came together to create a new moving and invigorating style of music. Joseph Puerta\, Christopher North\, David Pack\, and Burleigh Drummond produced a sound that was immediately recognized. Today\, Ambrosia is three of the original members with the addition of guitarist Doug Jackson\, contributing keyboardist Mary Harris\, and powerful lead vocals of Kipp Lennon (from the band Venice). \nAlways exploring the possibilities of progressive\, classical\, and world influences – with tangled roots of soul\, rhythm\, and blues – Ambrosia is continuing to entertain their original fans while still engaging newer audiences. \nOriginally labeled as America’s answer to the progressive invasion of English acts Yes and King Crimson\, the group quickly proved itself with a unique blend of aural landscapes. Their musical styles attracted the collaboration with cultural icons Leonard Bernstein\, Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\, Alan Parsons\, Bruce Hornsby\, Michael McDonald\, Edgar Winter\, Dave Mason\, Gary Wright\, Al Stewart\, and others. Ambrosia had toured extensively with Fleetwood Mac\, Heart\, and the Doobie Brothers. \nDuring Ambrosia’s early recording history they garnered 5 Grammy Nominations\, received frequent radio airplay\, and gained the admiration and respect of the musical community – in addition to their sold out concerts around the world. Ambrosia achieved 5 Top 40 hit singles on Warner Bros. Records\, released between 1975 and 1980\, including “How Much I Feel” and “Biggest Part of Me”. In 2015 the group released a new single\, “Hopes and Dreams”\, which was featured on the series called The Sparrows that aired on the Fox television channel. As of 2017\, the new Ambrosia material keeps coming.
