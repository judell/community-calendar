SUMMARY:Tim & Sam Show- Valentine Day Party at Rio Nido Roadhouse
DESCRIPTION:Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be quiet—or serious. \nJoin us at Rio Nido Roadhouse for a Valentine’s Night with Tim Sawyer (Free Peoples Band) & Sam Hamby (Marshall House Project) come together for a duo set built for bad decisions and good stories. Think swampy grooves\, honey-soaked vocals\, and rhythms that slide somewhere between romance and revelry. Whether you’re locked in with your Valentine or dancing with strangers\, this is music that invites you to stay out and let the good times roll. \nWith Mardi Gras just around the corner\, we’re leaning into a little sparkle\, a little mischief\, and a whole lot of fun. \nCome solo. Come coupled. Come as a group. \nLove is optional. Music is not.

SUMMARY:Sugarloaf Great Backyard Bird Count!
DESCRIPTION:Join Sugarloaf birders and other participants from more than 200 countries in the Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC)! Last year\, more than 800\,000 people helped identify more than 8\,000 bird species. We will start with an introduction to the eBird app\, which we will use to submit our group checklist. Then we will start birding as we hike ~1.5 mile hike (with ~300’ ascent) looking and listening for birds. We will also talk about using the Merlin app to help identify birds by sound or by photo. At the end\, we will submit our bird checklist via eBird. If you are on eBird\, we will share it with you so that it shows up on your account as well. If you are interested in using the Merlin app\, we highly recommend you install it on your phone along with the bird pack for US: West Coast before you arrive for the hike\, as cell service is very spotty or non-existent within the park. During the four days of the GBBC (February 13-16)\, you can see the map light up with checklists being submitted in real time across the world. \nMeet at the White Barn parking lot. There is a reservation fee of $10 per adult\, which will be refunded that day on site\, unless you choose to donate it. Children under 18 attend for free but must be registered and accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Wear layers (it is likely to be very cold up here)\, appropriate footwear for muddy/slippery trails\, sun protection\, bring at least a quart of water\, binoculars\, and if desired\, a snack\, a camera\, and/or a bird identification guide. We also invite you to bring a reusable drink container so your little ones can enjoy hot cocoa after the walk\, if desired. Heavy rains cancel. Parking fees apply.
