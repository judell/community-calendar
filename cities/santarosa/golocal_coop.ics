SUMMARY:Train Talk
DESCRIPTION:Railroad historian and former Northwestern Pacific and Southern Pacific officer Fred Codoni will discuss the history of the railroad in Sonoma County\, from the early horse-drawn streetcars – ‘horse car lines’ – to the formation of the Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railroad (P&SR) that went through Sebastopol. The current West County Museum in downtown Sebastopol was the terminal. Fred Codoni’s collection of over 14\,000 railroad images across this history represents a powerful and unique set of artifacts that bring to life an amazing century of change across transportation\, manufacturing\, and rural life. He has worked for the railroad industry since 1956\, and is the last surviving member of the Northwest Pacific Railroad. As a member of the Western Railway Museum\, Fred often ran P&SR passenger car No. 63 at the Western Railway museum at Rio Vista junction\, the only remaining operating car from that railroad. \nThis talk is a project from the Western Sonoma County Historical Society. It will be preceded by a short update by the society board about what is happening at the Historical Society.

SUMMARY:Mark Hummel’s Blues Harmonica Blowout
DESCRIPTION:Mark Hummel’s 35th Annual Blues Harmonica Blowout with Mark Hummel\, Magic Dick\, Steve Freund\, Anson Funderburgh\, Rodrigo Mantovani\, RJ Mischo\, Curtis Salgado\, and drummer Wes Starr. \nMark Hummel’s Blues Harmonica Blowout™ started on a Sunday night in 1991 at Ashkenaz in Berkeley with four harmonica players: Rick Estrin\, Mark\, Dave Earl and Doug Jay. Each player performed a twenty-to-thirty minute set\, and everyone jammed together with Hummel’s Blues Survivors as backup. Over the next five years\, it grew to become a multi venue event around California and included bigger names like William Clarke\, Norton Buffalo\, and Paul DeLay. By the year 2000 the Blowout was headlining Yoshi’s in Oakland as a four-night show with Rod Piazza\, Kim Wilson\, Rick Estrin\, James Harman and Billy Branch. These shows were recorded for Mountain Top Records. \nSince then\, the Blues Harmonica Blowout has become a who’s who of older and younger players\, black\, white\, male and female\, national\, and international. From icons like Snooky Pryor\, Carey Bell\, James Cotton\, Charlie Musselwhite\, John Mayall\, John Hammond\, Little Sonny\, Lazy Lester\, Billy Boy Arnold\, Sam Myers\, Corky Siegel\, Magic Dick\, Huey Lewis\, Lee Oscar\, Jerry Portnoy\, Howard Levy and Paul Oscher to younger players like Sugar Ray Norcia\, Jason Ricci\, Son Of Dave\, Aki Kumar\, Curtis Salgado\, Kenny Neal\, RJ Mischo\, Sugar Blue\, Annie Raines\, Carlos Del Junco\, just to name a few. \nThe selection of guitarists has also been a stunner including Duke Robillard\, Rusty Zinn\, Bob Welsh\, Little Charlie Baty\, Anson Funderburgh\, Jr. Watson\, Billy Flynn\, Steve Freund\, Mike Keller\, and many more.
