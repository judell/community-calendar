SUMMARY:Jay Lewellen at the Penngrove Pub
DESCRIPTION:BIO:\nSpending his high school and procrastinated college years in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina\, bluegrass and mountain music found its way into Jay’s heart. Country rock was not only in the air\, it was the air. In the 1970’s there was plenty of blues rock everywhere that was like a bedrock foundation. \nAfter college\, Jay headed for San Francisco. Could there be a more radical cultural shift than the Blue Ridge mountains to San Francisco? Probably not in this country! Diving into the music scene of the Grateful Dead and California music festivals of all sorts\, his musical perspective was pretty much fully formed\, adding some touches of jazz and swing music in there somewhere.

SUMMARY:Fortepianist Daniel Adam Maltz at the Raven
DESCRIPTION:Classical music as it was intended to be heard: on a Viennese fortepiano.\nIn this delightful concert\, Vienna-based fortepianist Daniel Adam Maltz and soprano Jennifer Ellis Kampani perform Mozart\, Haydn\, and Beethoven as those composers intended their music to be heard. \nDaniel specializes in historically informed performance. Called “the foremost performer in the world of the fortepiano” (Aspen Daily News)\, he has been praised for imbuing “[Beethoven’s] tenderness\, longing\, and frustration into the very notes” (Orlando Sentinel)\, for “lavish but tasteful” playing (Classical Sonoma)\, and as “a privilege to hear” (Marblehead Current). He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London and at the University for Music and Performing Arts in Vienna and performs exclusively on historic Viennese fortepianos. \nAppearing with him at the Raven is Grammy-nominated soprano Jennifer Ellis Kampani\, who is known for her expressive interpretations of Lieder — Classical-era songs. Ellis Kampari has appeared at Carnegie Hall and performed with leading ensembles including American Bach Soloists\, Apollo’s Fire\, Opera Lafayette\, and Portland Baroque Orchestra. She lives in Los Angeles and teaches at USC. \nSunday\, February 15th. 7:00 PM. \nFront of House: $38\nGeneral Admission: $23\nStudent: $13
