 onship with revision!Session Focus: Whole-body Characters We’ll explore 
 ways to create vivid people on the page and strengthen other elements thro
 ugh character\, including point of view\, sense of place\, and emotional r
 esonance.Revision is to a first draft what marriage is to falling head-ove
 r heels. It is to free write what deep friendship is to casual meeting. Re
 vision takes time\, skill\, caring\, and fortitude. It asks that we be gen
 erous and also draw boundaries. It presents us with choices that challenge
  what we believe to be true about others and ourselves. Revision is not fo
 r the faint of heart\, but for writers committed to their relationship wit
 h creative expression through all the rough patches. Revision allows write
 rs to investigate their heart work and intentions and stay true.I’ll sha
 re a process that I call “Master Craft Juggling\,” which incorporates 
 my Nine Ways to Mastery approach for writing fiction\, memoir\, and nonfic
 tion. The session includes a craft presentation\, group discussion\, and w
 riting time.You will:• Gain perspectives and techniques for masterful re
 vision• Build community with writers who may become trusted readers for 
 your projects• Improve your writing and writing practice through revisio
 n• Move your projects toward publicationPlease bring your:• Open mind
 • Fiction or nonfiction free write\, early draft\, or manuscript in prog
 ress• Tools and materials for writing during the session• Writing and 
 revision challenges to discuss\, particularly as relate to the session foc
 usThe workshop will be offered periodically with a particular focus each t
 ime. Check the schedule\, and sign up when you’re ready to revise.About 
 the Instructor: Christine Walker is a visual artist\, author\, and strateg
 ic visioning consultant. Her published books include the novel “Tap Danc
 ing at the Bluebird\,” the memoir “A Painter’s Garden: Cultivating t
 he Creative Life\,” the children’s book and songs “Wooleycat’s Mus
 ical Theater\,” and books on writing craft — “A Writer’s Resolutio
 n: A Guided Journal for Realizing a Rewarding Writing Practice” and\, fo
 r publication in 2027\, “Our Writing Minds in Play: The Nine Ways Guide 
 to Masterful Fiction & Memoir.” Her paintings are exhibited in galleries
  and corporate and private collections. She holds an MFA in Writing and Li
 terature in Fiction from Bennington College and an MA in Creative Arts Int
 erdisciplinary from San Francisco State University. The Bennington program
  promised: “Read one hundred books. Write one.” This motto inspired he
 r to design teaching frameworks and courses—Master Craft Juggling\, Nine
  Ways to Mastery\, Read to Write Books—to help writers elevate their wri
 ting practice and readers to engage more deeply in enjoying and discussing
  books. Throughout her multi-faceted creative career\, she’s found that 
 resilience is key to a rewarding career in the arts. She brings that resil
 ience to teaching revision as a writing skill\, as well as a practice. \n\

 s\, collage pieces bring together fragments that reveal hidden connections
  and untold narratives. In this class\, you’ll reflect on what matters m
 ost to you and how that can be expressed through art. Catherine will help 
 you release the need for perfection and trust your creative instincts. By 
 the end of the workshop\, you’ll not only have a finished artwork but al
 so a deeper connection to your creative potential and a renewed love for t
 he art of collage.What you’ll learn: Creative ways to incorporate your p
 ersonal story in your art\, Methods for sourcing interesting collage paper
 s\, Techniques for crafting textured\, multi-layered collages\, Strategies
  for refining your compositionYou are highly encouraged to bring your own 
 papers to personalize your artwork like ephemera that represents your life
 \, copies of photos\, old letters\, books\, papers from memorable experien
 ces or travels\, or documents that hold meaning. If you’re not comfortab
 le using these documents\, you should make color copies of them. For this 
 process\, it is also best to make laser copies of your photographs.Supplie

 +In this one day introductory workshop\, participants will get a peek into
  the process of building one’s drawing abilities through developing clos
 e observational skills and learning fundamental drawing techniques. If you
  find this intro helpful and want to keep exploring\, you can sign up for 
 the 3 week class one month later.This course is for anyone who wants to pr
 actice and advance their drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t 
 practiced in years\, or any artists who just want to learn more and practi
 ce with consistent feedback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learni
 ng to see - a skill that anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Throu
 gh demonstration\, practice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will 
 explore the foundations of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure 
 environment. Observational drawing gives all artists a foundation of pract
 ical knowledge and skills that infinitely expands the possibilities of wha
 t one can create. If your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if y
 ou feel frustrated or stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply w
 ant to start drawing and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the clas
 s for you. About the Instructor: Hannah Day received her BA in Visual Arts

 hoed across many cultures\, Jizo figures traditionally honor children and 
 all who have passed\, those in transition\, and those in distress.This ong
 oing project is dedicated to remembering those lost to war\, with a specia
 l focus now on the approximately 19\,000 children who have perished in Isr
 ael and Gaza in recent years. Through the simple\, meditative act of worki
 ng with clay\, we create benevolent beings that will become part of public
  exhibits and peace sites\, offering spaces for reflection\, mourning\, an
 d hope. Our gatherings conclude with a gentle ritual to honor the lives of
  these children.We meet from 1:30–4:00 pm on the first Friday of each mo
 nth at SebArts\, in the Painting & Drawing Room. The gathering is open to 
 ages 12 - adult\, and no prior clay experience is necessary—all clay and
  basic materials are supplied. Registration is required to participate.The
 re is no fee for this class\; donations are welcome to help cover material

 ease consider it a donation. Thank you!)The practice of “poem making” 
 offers a means to express the metaphors and meaning of the joys and suffer
 ing we experience in ourselves and bear witness to in others. Poetry can b
 e a salve for the heart and soul. It is a way of speaking what is true in 
 our hearts and is often difficult to access without a creative spark. You 
 do not have to be a "poet" or even a "writer" to allow words and feelings 
 to pour through your pen.Redwing Keyssar has been leading "poetic medicine
 " sessions through her work in Palliative Care at UCSF for the past 5 year
 s. Her work has created an international community of people who\, by list
 ening to and writing poetry together\, have healed wounds of grief and los
 s\, helped "wounded healers\," and provided resiliency to move forward on 
 our life paths.Writing poetry in community is a bit like attending a medit
 ation retreat. The instruction for most beginners when learning to meditat
 e is to simply bring oneself back to the breath\, each time the mind wande
 rs. In poem-making\, the instruction is to bring oneself back to the heart
  and along with a deep breath\, see if one can open a little bit wider. Wh
 en we witness each other in this process\, in a circle of open-heartedness
 \, something magical happens!This is an IN-PERSON gathering to establish a
  strong and safe creative community. We are all poets!About the Instructor

 ay\, March 28\, 2026\; 10am - 4pm$150 + $15 materials feeAsemic writing is
  the practice of creating artwork through marks that resemble handwriting\
 , yet carry no literal meaning or readable text. It is the word before wor
 ds form—the voice too distant to be understood—a cosmic expression wit
 hout country or dialect.We’ll begin with a slideshow exploring the depth
  and range of asemic writing. Looking at ancient scripts\, global language
 s\, symbols\, the calligraphic line\, and the work of contemporary asemic 
 artists\, we’ll expand our understanding of what is possible.From there\
 , you’ll begin your own asemic journey. These marks can infiltrate and t
 ransform your current artwork\, or stand alone as independent works of art
 .Using ink and watercolor with a variety of tools\, we’ll explore how to
  express what does not need to be said in words. My intention is to guide 
 you toward authentic marks—marks that arise from the heart and move beyo
 nd casual scribbling into something deeply felt and uniquely your own. All
  levels welcome.About the Instructor: Sherrie Lovler holds a BA in Studio 
 Art and has been teaching calligraphy and related arts for several decades
 . Well-known in the Western calligraphy community\, she has taught at inte
 rnational calligraphy conferences as well as at Ghost Ranch\, Friends of C
 alligraphy in San Francisco\, Society of Scribes in NYC\, La Romita School
  of Art in Italy\, Northern Arizona University\, O’Hanlon Center for the

 fundamental drawing techniques that will inform all of their other creativ
 e pursuits. This course is for anyone who wants to practice and advance th
 eir drawing skills - beginners\, those who haven’t practiced in years\, 
 or any artists who just want to learn more and practice with consistent fe
 edback and guidance. Learning to draw is truly learning to see - a skill t
 hat anyone can be taught\, practice\, and hone. Through demonstration\, pr
 actice\, and reflective discussion\, this class will explore the foundatio
 ns of classical drawing techniques in a low pressure environment. Observat
 ional drawing gives all artists a foundation of practical knowledge and sk
 ills that infinitely expands the possibilities of what one can create. If 
 your ideas feel limited by your drawing skills\, if you feel frustrated or
  stuck in your painting practice\, or if you simply want to start drawing 
 and are looking for a way to begin\, this is the class for you. About the
