SUMMARY:Community Event: We The People Quilt Starter Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Santa Rosa Creative Circle (SRCC)\n***The info below is from o
 ne of the founders of this project. The true host of this event. This is m
 y commentary: this effort is not about left or right & division. It’s ab
 out creating a tangible vision of a positive world. I’m a big believer t
 hat art saves & love wins. I’ve got big emotions right now & I need a pl
 ace to put them. This project will help me with that & maybe it will help 
 you too. Join us…let’s do this as a community. I will be hosting weekl
 y get togethers so folks can work on their project at The Arthaus. Final p
 anels due 5/15. No sewing experience - no worries\, there are other option
 s (ex: paint). 💜***\n\nPiece by piece\, a hopeful vision…an opportuni
 ty to contribute to this community quilt project!\n\nA local group of Sono
 ma County people are creating a large quilt to display a hopeful vision fo
 r our nation: a more perfect union\, where liberty and justice for all is 
 real for everyone.\n\nAt a moment of rising fascism and accelerating attac
 ks on human rights\, democracy\, and the environment\, this project assert
 s a simple truth: the power belongs to the people.\n\nThrough this collabo
 rative art project\, we’re coming together to reflect what we value\, wh
 at we hope for\, and what kind of world we want to build together\, and ma
 king it visual.\n\nPlease join us at this meetup and get started on a quil
 t square\, to add your voice and vision to the quilt! We are planning to p
 artner with Indivisible Sonoma County to host a celebration of the finishe
 d quilt on 4th of July weekend at a public event (location TBA)!\n\nThe fi
 rst hour: Learn about the quilt project\, brainstorm ideas for your quilt 
 panel and get started on a design.\n\nStay for another hour for studio tim
 e to continue working on the design for your quilt square and collaborate 
 on this hopeful grass-roots project!\n\nSome fabric and pattern materials 
 provided to get you started.\n\nLearn more about this FREE project at:\n\n
