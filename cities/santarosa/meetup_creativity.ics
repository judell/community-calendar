SUMMARY:Community Event: We The People Quilt Starter Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Santa Rosa Creative Circle\n***The info below is from one of t
 he founders of this project. The true host of this event. This is my comme
 ntary: this effort is not about left or right & division. It’s about cre
 ating a tangible vision of a positive world. I’m a big believer that art
  saves & love wins. I’ve got big emotions right now & I need a place to 
 put them. This project will help me with that & maybe it will help you too
 . Join us…let’s do this as a community. I will be hosting weekly get t
 ogethers so folks can work on their project at The Arthaus. Final panels d
 ue 5/15. No sewing experience - no worries\, there are other options (ex: 
 paint). ***\n\nPiece by piece\, a hopeful vision…an opportunity to contr
 ibute to this community quilt project!\n\nA local group of Sonoma County p
 eople are creating a large quilt to display a hopeful vision for our natio
 n: a more perfect union\, where liberty and justice for all is real for ev
 eryone.\n\nAt a moment of rising fascism and accelerating attacks on human
  rights\, democracy\, and the environment\, this project asserts a simple 
 truth: the power belongs to the people.\n\nThrough this collaborative art 
 project\, we’re coming together to reflect what we value\, what we hope 
 for\, and what kind of world we want to build together\, and making it vis
 ual.\n\nPlease join us at this meetup and get started on a quilt square\, 
 to add your voice and vision to the quilt! We are planning to partner with
  Indivisible Sonoma County to host a celebration of the finished quilt on 
 4th of July weekend at a public event (location TBA)!\n\nThe first hour: L
 earn about the quilt project\, brainstorm ideas for your quilt panel and g
 et started on a design.\n\nStay for another hour for studio time to contin
 ue working on the design for your quilt square and collaborate on this hop
 eful grass-roots project!\n\nSome fabric and pattern materials provided to
  get you started.\n\nLearn more about this FREE project at:\n\nhttps://www
