SUMMARY:Bone by Bone - Lecture
DESCRIPTION:Bone by Bone: The Commingled Remains from theTomb at Tell Abr
 aq\, UAE (2200-2000 BC)  The tomb at the archaeological site of Tell Abra
 q\, located near modern-day Abu Dhabi and Dubai\, was discovered in 1989 
 and excavated over several field seasons. Over 300 individuals were place
 d in the tomb including premature and newborn infants\, toddlers\, teens\
 , and adult males and females of all ages. Over time\,the addition of cor
 pses caused the disarticulation of most all of the skeletal remains. Our 
 analysis proceeded on a bone by bone basis and questions about health and
  disease\, trauma and violence\, and diet and nutrition were addressed us
 ing innovative methods for skeletal analysis. "Osteobiographies" were cre
 ated that provide a glimpse into what life was like over 4000 years ago i
 n in the deserts of Arabia. And\, one very enigmatic teenager\, the only 
 individual whose remains were not commingled\, and perhaps the last perso
 n to be put in the tomb\, provides a poignant reminder of the toll that d
 isease takes.Event Details    Sunday\, February 22nd from 4-5 pm    SRJC 
 Petaluma Student Center in Mike Smith Hall    Debra L. Martin\, Distingui
 shed Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the University of Nevada in Las
  Vegas\, is an expert on violence in past societies\, which includes expe
 rtise in human osteology and bioarchaeology. She received her PhD from th
 e University of Massachusetts. The analysis of skeletonized human remains
  from archaeological as well as historic and contemporary settings form a
  basis for understanding the effects of trauma\, fractures\, disability a
 nd wounds related to lethal and nonlethal violence. She is the Series Edi
 tor for Bioarchaeology and Social Theory\, a book series dedicated to cut
 ting-edge bioarchaeological work published by Springer Verlag. She is als
 o the Editor of the journal\, American Antiquity. Her recent publications
  include co-authoring Gender Violence in the American Southwest (AD 1100)
  (Routledge)\, co-editing Bioarchaeology of Borders and Frontiers (UPF)\,
  Massacres (UPF)\, and Bioarchaeological and Forensic Perspectives on Vio
 lence (Cambridge). She is co-author of the textbook\, Bioarchaeology An I
