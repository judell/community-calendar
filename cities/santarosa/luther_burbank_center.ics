DESCRIPTION:Back to All Shows\n\n\nI’m With Her\n\nSaturday\, June 6\, 2026\n\n8:00 pm\n\n\nBUY TICKETS \n\n\nWith the 2014 formation of I’m With Her\, singer/songwriters Sarah Jarosz\, Aoife O’Donovan\, and Sara Watkins introduce an essential new force into the world of folk music: a close-knit alliance of highly esteemed musicians\, each graced with a deep understanding of folk tradition and unbridled passion for expanding its possibilities. \nOn their long awaited second LP\, Wild and Clear and Blue\, their luminous harmonies infuse a soul-searching body of work that explores themes of ancestry\, lineage\, and the collective human experience with stories about reaching into the past\, navigating a chaotic present\, and bravely moving forward into the unknown. It follows a critically lauded debut album\, See You Around\, and standalone singles\, like “Call My Name” (winner of the 2020 Grammy for Best American Roots Song). \nAll multi-Grammy-winners with deep roots in the folk scene\, Watkins\, Jarosz\, and O’Donovan first discovered their chemistry during an impromptu performance at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival\, then co-founded I’m With Her\, and began touring extensively and performing at acclaimed festivals across the globe. \nProduced by Josh Kaufman—a member of Bonny Light Horseman and multi-instrumentalist/songwriter/arranger/producer who’s worked with Bob Weir and The National—Wild and Clear and Blue ultimately adds a bold new urgency to their delicate entangling of lived-in narrative\, fable-like storytelling\, and nuanced reflection on cycles of life. \nI’m With Her has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity\, access\, and dignity for all. www.plus1.org \n\n\nTHIRD PARTY RESELLERS\nDon’t get taken by deceptive online resellers who use bots to buy tickets and then mark up their prices.
